EXT. PARIS -- AFTERNOON

Delerue's theme from "Antoine and Colette" plays over an
opening credit sequence consisting of a series of images of
Paris. Each shot is composition of the streets, landmarks
and the minute details of this beautiful August afternoon.
The last shot begins wide on the Shakespeare Bookstore and
closes in on a sign in the window announcing an event:

"Jesse Wallace, young author of the acclaimed best-seller
THIS TIME, Saturday, August 23." A brooding picture of Jesse
is prominent. Over the image, we hear a French Journalist
asking a question.

FRENCH JOURNALIST #1 (0.S.)
Do you consider the book to be
autobiographical?

INT. SHAKESPEARE BOOKSTORE -- AFTERNOON

Inside this funky bookstore, JESSE, early 30's, is sitting
casually with a few journalists and patrons.

JESSE

isn't everything autobiographical, I
mean we ail see the world from our
own tiny keyhole. I always think of
Thomas Wolfe - have you ever seen
that little one page 'note to reader’
in the front of Look Homeward, Angel.
Do you know what I'm talking about?

Vague affirmatives. .

JESSE (CONT'D)
Anyway, He says how we are the sum
of all the moments of our lives,
that anybody who writes will use the
clay of their lives, that you can't
avoid that. I remember he says he
can't imagine anything more
autobiographical then Gulliver's
Travels.

INT/EXT. BEFORE SUNRISE MONTAGE

Over the next section of dialog, we see an approximately 90
second series of shots from BEFORE SUNRISE that silently
tell the story: boy meets girl on a train, boy and girl get
to know one another, boy and girl kiss, get more intimate,
part at dawn.

JESSE (0.S.}
When I look at my life, I have to
admit I've never been around a bunch

of guns or violence, a helicopter
crash, political intrigue. But my
life, from my point of view, has
been full of drama. And one of the
most exciting things that's ever
happened to me is actually connecting
with another person and I thought if
I could write a book that could
capture that, make that connection
valuable, that possibility...anyway
that was the attempt. I don't know
if that answers your question...

He kh OF

FRENCH JOURNALIST #1
"ll be more specific. Was there
ever a young French woman on a train
you met and spent an evening with?

JESSE
See to me, that's not important.

FRENCH JOURNALIST #2
So, that's a yes?

JESSE
Okay, since this is the last stop
of my book tour and I am in France,
Yes.

We're now near the end of the montage where Celine and Jesse
say their good-byes at the train station and are soon
traveling alone.

FRENCH JOURNALIST #1
The book ends on an ambiguous note -
we don't know. Do you think they
get back together in six months like
they promised each other?

JESSE
I think how you answer that is a
good test as to whether you ‘are a
romantic or a cynic. *

He looks at the journalists and points at each of them as he
speaks.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 3.

JESSE (CONT'D)
You think they get back together,
you don't, you hope they do but aren't
sure.

FRENCH JOURNALIST #1
But do YOU think they do? Did you
in real life?

JESSE
Well, in the words of my grandfather,
to answer that would take the piss
outta the whole thing.

Still offscreen, the Bookstore Manager chimes in.

MANAGER (0.S.)
We have time for one last question.

INT. SHAKESPEARE BOOKSTORE -- AFTERNOON
We're now back inside.

FRENCH JOURNALIST #2
What is your next book?

JESSE
I've always wanted to write a book
where the whole thing happens within
the space of one pop song.

FRENCH JOURNALIST #1
What song?

JESSE
T don't know, haven't written it yet -
"the Long and Winding Road" maybe...
The story's about this guy living in
Miami at his in-laws beach house,
and he's totally depressed. His
great dream was to be an adventurer,
a lover, riding motorcycles through
South America. But instead, he
sitting at this marble table eating
lobster, He's got a job, a beautiful .
wife, all that he needs, but none of
it matters - what he wants is to
fight for meaning.

Across the room, CELINE emerges from behind a row of books,
where she's been hiding and listening.

JESSE (CONT'D)
Happiness is in the doing, right?
not getting what you want.

*
 

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8403 4.

JESSE (CONT'D)
And just that second his five year-
old daughter ‘jumps up on the table.
He knows she shouldn't be there ~
she could get hurt. But she is
dancing to this pop song in a summer
dress.

Celine is looking at him.

JESSE (CONT'D)
All of sudden he's 16 and his high-
school sweetheart is dropping him
off at home. They just lost their
virginity and she loves him and the
same song is playing on the car radio,
and she climbs up dancing on the
roof of the car. And now he's worried
about her. She's beautiful with a
facial expression just like his
daughter. Maybe that's why he likes
her. He knows he is not REMEMBERING
this dance. He is there - he is
there in both moments simultaneously.
In fact he pulls away from a kiss
with the girlfriend so as to not
offend his daughter. Both moments
are real, happening together. For @
moment all his life is foiding in
and it's obvious to him that time is
a lie...

He looks up and sees Celine for the first time.

JESSE (CONT'D)
Its all happening all the time and
inside every moment, is another, all
happening simultaneously.

He takes a beat, still looking at Celine, not sure what to

do next.

JESSE (CONT'D)
Anyway, that's kinda the idea, anyway.

MANAGER
Our author needs to be going to the
airport soon. I'd like to thank all
ef you for coming over this afternoon,
and especially like to thank Mr.
Wallace for being with us. We hope
to see you again with your next book.
So everyone, please help yourselves
to champagne and cookies.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 5.

There is polite applause and people start to disperse. Jesse
looks back over to Celine - she gives a little wave. He
gets the manager's attention.

JESSE
(to Manager}
How long 'till I have to leave here
for the airport?

MANAGER
You should leave about 7:15 or so,
7:30 at the latest.

JESSE
Okay...

Jesse walks over to Celine.

JESSE (CONT'D)
Hi.
CELINE
Hello.
A slightly awkward double cheek kiss.

JESSE
How are you?

CELINE
Good, and you?

JESSE
Great. You wanna get some coffee or
something?

CELINE
Didn't he just say you have a plane
to catch?

JESSE

I have a little time. Want to get
out of here?

CELINE
Okay.

JESSE
Yes?

Jesse goes back over to the manager.

JESSE (CONT'D)
I'll be back in thirty, forty-five
minutes or so. We're just going to
go get a cup of coffee.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03

MANAGER
Okay, but get your driver Phillipe's
card so you'll have his cell phone.
Call him if you're running late.

SA.
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 6.

MANAGER (CONT'D)
We'll get your bags in the car so
you won't be late to the airport.

JESSE
Okay. Thanks for everything.

As they start to exit the store, Jesse is detained briefly,
signing a book, getting the card from the driver, etc. Celine
exits in front of him.

EXT. WALK FROM BOOKSTORE --~ AFTERNOON

Outside the bookstore, Jesse puts his hands on Celine's
shoulders and just looks at her.

JESSE
I can't believe you're here!

CELINE
I live here in Paris. Are you sure
you don't have to stay? Aren't you
supposed to talk to those people.

JESSE
It's okay, they're sick of me - I
spent the night here last night.

CELINE
You did?

JESSE
They have a loft upstairs. How are
you? This is so weird.

CELINE
I'm fine. It's good to see you.

JESSE
Tt's good to see you too.

CELINE
So you want to go to a cafe?

JESSE
Sure.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/87/03 7.

CELINE
There's one a little further, that I
like a lot.

®@ JESSE
Alright.

They start walking.

JESSE (CONT'D)
I thought I was going to totally
lose it in there after I saw you.
How'd you even know I was going to
be here?

CELINE
It's my favorite bookstore in Paris.
You can sit down for hours, I love
it - even if there's fleas.

JESSE
I think a cat slept on my head last
night.

CELINE

I saw your picture on the calendar

about a month ago and that you were

going to be here. It's funny I read

an article on your book and it sounded
@ vaguely familiar, but I didn't put

it all together until I saw the photo.

JESSE
Did you have a chance to read it?

CELINE
Yes. I was really surprised as you
can imagine.
{a beat)
I had to read it twice, actually.

Jesse just looks at her.

JESSE
Comme ci comme ca?

CELINE
No, I really like it - it's romantic.
I usually don't like that but it's
well written. Congratulations.

JESSE
Thanks.

e Celine suddenly stops and looks at Jesse.
 

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03

CELINE
But. before we go anywhere I have to
ask you, did you show up in Vienna
that December?

JESSE
Did you?

TA.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03

CELINE
I couldn't, but did you? I have to
know. It's important to me.

JESSE
(playful)

Why, if you didn't?

CELINE
Did you?

JESSE
No.

CELINE

Oh thank God you didn't.

JESSE.
Yeah, thank God you didn't either.
If one of us would have been there
alone, it would have sucked.

They continue walking.

CELINE
I know, I was so concerned with that.
I've always felt horrible about not
being there but I couldn't, my grandma
died a few days before and she was
buried that day, December 16th.

JESSE
{almost relieved)
She died? The one in Budapest?

CELINE
How did you remember that?

JESSE
I remember everything.

CELINE
Oh, of course, it was in your book.
Anyway, I was just about to fly to
Vienna to meet you when we got the
news about her, then of course I
went to the funeral with my parents.

JESSE
I'm so sorry to hear that.
 

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 9.

CELINE
But you weren't there anyway.
(suddenly suspicious)
Wait, why weren't you there? If
would have been there if I could
have - I had made plans. You better
have a good reason.

They slow to a stop and just look at each other. She realizes
he's. been lying.

CELINE (CONT'D)
Oh no! You were there, weren't you?

JESSE
{down}
Yeah,

CELINE
Ahhhh! That's terrible! I'm so
sorry. I'm laughing but Tf don't
mean it. Did you hate me? You must
have hated me.
(a beat)
Have you hated me all this time?

JESSE
No.
CELINE
Yes you have, but you can't hate me
now.
JESSE
No... I don't hate you. C'mon, no

big deal. I flew over there, you
blew the whole thing off, I gave up
on love, and my life's been a big
nose-dive since then, but hey, no

big deal.

CELINE
No!

JESSE
I'm kidding.

CELINE

I can't believe it. You must have
felt really angry with me. I'm so
sorry ~ I wanted to be there more
than anything in the world. But you
can't be angry anymore, I mean my
grand-ma~-~
 

 

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 10.

JESSE
Honestly, I had a feeling something
like that might have happened. I
was bummed, but I was mostly just
mad that we hadn't exchanged phone
numbers or any information.

CELINE
I know, that was so stupid - no way
to get in touch, I didn't even know
your last name.

JESSE
I know! We had nothing to go on.

CELINE
I was cursing... - If I could just
reach him. .

JESSE
I know, remember the reason we did
that...we were both afraid if we
started calling and writing it would
slowly fade away.

CELINE
It definitely wasn't a slow fade.

JESSE
Sure wasn't.

CELINE
Yes, we wanted to pick it up where
we left off, which would have been a
good idea if...

JESSE
(butting in)
If it'd just worked! Oh well.

CELINE
So how long were you in Vienna?

JESSE
Couple of days. .

CELINE
Did you meet another girl?

JESSE
Yeah, her name was Gretchen, she was
awesome. The book's actually a
composite of the two of you...
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03

CELINE
Really?!
JESSE
No... I even went back to the train

station and put up a sign that had
the number to my hotel, just in case
you had been delayed a half day or
something... total dork.

CELINE
Did you get any calls?

JESSE
Just a couple of hookers looking for
a gig.
(a beat)
Hey, it was awful, what do you want
me to say?

CELINE
Oh, that's so sad. I'm so sorry.

They start walking again.

JESSE
Then I just walked around for a while
then eventually flew back home. I
owed my dad two grand, who had warned
me about French chicks.

CELINE
What did he tell you about French
women?

JESSE

Nothing, lots of crap. He's never
been with any French women. I don't
think he's ever been east of the
Mississippi.

CELINE
Why didn't you put the six months
later part in the book?

JESSE
But I did!

CELINE
Really?

JESSE

I wrote a fictional version where
you do show up.

CELINE
You did? What happens?
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03

JESSE
Oh, we make love for like ten days
straight...

1l~A.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03

CELINE
That's interesting.

JESSE
And then they find out more about
each other and realize they don't
really get along.

CELINE
I like that.., It's more real.

JESSE
My editor didn't feel that way.

CELINE
Yes, everybody wants to believe in
ilove. ft sells.

JESSE
Yep.
CELINE
But things are going well for you,
right?
{pause}

Your book's a bestseller in the U.S.?

JESSE
It's a tiny bestseller, but
officially, yes. But hey, most people
haven't read Moby Dick, so why the
hell should they read my book?

CELINE
I never read Moby Dick, but I liked
your book, even though I thought
you idealized our night a bit.

JESSE
Hey, it's fiction.

CELINE
i know, but I thought there wete
times when you made me, I mean her,
no, me, like sometimes she's was a
bit... psychotic.

JESSE
But you are a little like that.

CELINE
i know... Whatil!

JESSE
Just kidding. No really, where’d I
do that?

12,
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03

CELINE
Maybe it’s just me...It was so strange
to be reading something knowing the
character in the story is based on
you. It's both flattering and
disturbing at the same time.

JESSE
Why was it disturbing?

CELINE
I don't know, just -being part of
someone's memory, suddenly seeing
myself through your eyes. How long
did it take you to write it?

JESSE
On and off, 3 or 4 years.

CELINE
It's a long time to be writing about
one night.

JESSE
Tell mea about it. I feel like I
basically lived with you there for a
while.

CELINE
I'd always assumed you've forgotten
me.

JESSE
T had a pretty clear picture of you
in my mind. I gotta tell you
something - I've wanted to talk to
you for so long...

CELINE
Me too.

JESSE
It's surreal, now I feel everything
I say should be...

CELINE
Yeah, and now we have what? twenty
minutes and thirty seconds?

JESSE
More than that, much more than that.
I want to know about you. What are
you up to?

13.
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 13A.

CELINE
Wheew. Where to start. I'm working
for Green Cross, it’s an environmental
organization.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 14.

JESSE
Wow. What are they all about?

CELINE
We basically work on many different
environment issues, from clean water
to disarmament of chemical weapons
you know, international laws that
deal with the environment.

JESSE
What do you do for them?

CELINS
Different things. Last year I was
in India for quite a while working
on a water treatment plant.

JESSE
Wow.

CELINE,
The cotton industry there is a major
source of pollution.

JESSE
I gotta say I admire the fact that
it sounds like you are actually DOING
something. Most people, myself
included, just bitch about everything:
how America's consuming all the
world's resources, we're creating
sweat shops in China, SUVs suck
global warming...

CELINE
I'm relived to hear you're not one
of those Freedom Fry kind of
Americans.

JESSE
Nah. But I gotta say, I think that's
S80 cool what you're doing. How'd
you get into that?

CELINE
When I.came out of political science
I thought I'd be working for the
government, and I did for a short
while and then I got tired of having
conversations with friends about how
the world was falling to pieces.

JESSE
I gotta say, that's awesome. I always
figured you'd be doing something
cool like that.

CELINE
Thanks. I'm lucky to have a job I
really like.

JESSE
You know, I actually alternate in
thinking that everything is
irrevocably screwed up, and actually
feeling things in a general might be
getting better.

CELINE
Better! How could “you possibly think
that?

JESSE

I know it sounds weird, but I think
there are things to be optimistic
about.

CELINE
(interrupting)
Okay, I know your book is selling,
but what are you talking about - the
world's a mess right now.

CELINE (CONT'D)

rom a western point of view things
are getting a bit better - we're
moving all our industry to developing
nations to get cheap labor free from
any environmental laws. The weapons
industry is out of control, five
million die every year due to
preventable water diseases. So how
is the world getting better? I'm
not getting angry, but really I want
to know?

JESSE
I know there are a lot of serious
problems - I don't have one publisher
in the entire Asian market.

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 16.

JESSE (CONT'D)
It might be getting better because
people like you are informed and
educated and speaking out and as the
world's consciousness and education
vises - things like women's issues,
racial rights, sexual rights,
children's rights...

CELINE
I know.

JESSE
I mean the very notion of conservation
and environmental issues - all that
weren't even in the vocabulary until
fairly recently - those are becoming
the norm and will eventually be what's
expected all over the world.

CELINE
IT agree with what you are saying but
it's dangerous. An imperialist
country can use that kind of thinking
to justify their economic greed.
Human rights is the only issue I...

Any particular imperialist country
you got in mind there, Frency?

CELINE
No, not really. Is it okay if we

JESSE

Perfect. But what I'm really saying
is the world might be evolving like
a person evolves. ME for example...
Am I improving? Am I getting worse?
When I was younger I was healthier
but I was racked with insecurity-
Now I'm older my problems are deeper,
but I'm more equipped to handle them.

What are your problems?

Long Pause.
 

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03

JESSE
Right now, I don"t feel like I have
any - just damn happy to be here.

Paris?

JESSE
Got in last night. I've done ten
cities in twelve days - I'm so glad
it's over. I'm so sick of being a

Bonjour. Vous dinner?

What do you want?

JESSE
I love the coffee over here so much
more than in the U.S.

CELINE
I couldn't even drink coffee when I
was living over there.

JESSE
You lived in the U.S.? When?

CELINE
From '96 through '99. I was studying
at NYU.

JESSE
Don't tell me that!

CELINE
What?

JESSE

Ch wow - that’s weird. I've been in
New York since '98. That's wild -
we were both there at the same time.

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 18.

CELINE
That is weird. You know, it actually
crossed my mind, if I might run into
you there, but the odds are so slim,
e you know? I had no idea even what
town you were living in. Weren't
you somewhere in Texas?

JESSE
I was for a long time but, I had to
get out there. I figured it was
time for me to be in New York. What
made you come back here?

CELINE
IT had finished my master's, for one,
but I was starting to get paranoid.
The stuff in the medias all the time -
murders, gang violence, serial
killers.

JESSE
i know.

CELINE
I was living in terror. The final
straw was one night I heard some
noise on my fire escape, I called
911 and the cops came...

@ JESSE

Like three hours later.

CELINE,

After I'd been raped and killed about
ten times. It was a man and a woman
officer. I was describing to them
what I had heard when the woman had
to run downstairs to move the police
car. I was alone with the male cop,
and right away he asked me if I had
agun. I said no and he told me I'd
better think about getting one -
this was America, not France. I
told him I didn't know how to shoot .
a gun and that I wasn't interested
in firearms. That is when he pulled
out his gun and said to me...

{cop voice)
"One day you're going to have
something like this in your face,
and if you want to live a long life,
you're going to have to choose between
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03

CELINE (CONT'D)
you or them." They left and the
next morning, I actually called for
an application to get a gun. Me, a
@ gun! But then I started thinking
that something was wrong, the way
that cop had pulled his gun.

JESSE
Yeah, sure.

CELINE
So I canceled my demand for a gun
and instead I called the police
station and tried to complain about
this cop's behavior.

JESSE -
What happened with that?

CELINE
It was so much paper work and with
my shitty student visa, so I gave up
and forgot about the whole thing.
Well, actually no, I never forgot.

JESSE
Obviously.

@ Coffee arrives.
CELINE

But still, I wouldn't mind being
back there - there's a lot of things
I miss about the U.S.

JESSE
Like what?

CELINE
The overall good mood people have
even if it can be bullshit. Like
“hey, how you doing? Great! How
YOU doin? Great! Have a great day."
Parisians are so grumpy. Have you
noticed?

JESSE
Really? Everyone around here seems
pretty happy to me.

CELINE
They're not happy. Maybe I just
mean the French men, they drive me

@ nuts.

JESSE
In that regard, I'm proud to be an
‘merican.

CELINE
And you should be ~ in that regard
only. Have you ever spent any time
in Eastern Europe?

JESSE
No.

CELINE
I remember as a teenager I went to
Warsaw when it was still a strict
communist regime, which I don't
approve of at all.

JESSE
Sure you don't.

CELINE
I don't at all, really. But something
about being there after a while was
very interesting, I found. After a
couple of weeks something changed in
me. The city was quite gloomy and
gray but after a while my brain seemed
Clearer. I was writing a lot more
in my journal, ideas I had never
thought of before.

JESSE
Communist ideas?

CELINE
Shut up! I'm not a communist.

JESSE
I know. Go ahead, sorry.

CELINE
It took me a while to figure out
why, why I felt so different. And
then, one day as I was walking throvgh
the Jewish cemetery, I don't know
why but it occurred to me there,
i realized I had just spent the past
couple of weeks away from most of my
habits. The TV was in a language I
didn't understand and there was
nothing to buy, no advertisements
anywhere.

Was I fat before?

JESSE
No, no.

You thought I was a fatty. You wrote
a book about a fat girl.

No seriously - you look beautiful.
Do I look any different?

CELINE
No... you have this little line here.

She points to the wrinkle between his eyebrows.

JESSE
I know, I know.

CELINE
Like a scar.

JESSE

A scar? Like a gunshot wound?

CELINE
No, I like it. I had a terrible
nightmare the other day. I was having
an awful dream that I was 32, then i
woke up and I was 23, relieved, and
then I woke up for real and I was
32.

JESSE
Aw shit, it happens.

CELINE
Time gets faster and faster.
Apparently it's because we don't
renew our synapses after 20, so it's
all pretty much downhill from then
on.

JESSE
On the other hand, I like getting
older. Life feels more immediate -
You can appreciate it more.

CELINE

Oh I know. I actually like it too.
JESSE

I was once a drummer in a band.
CELINE

You were?
JESSE

And we were pretty good too. But
the lead singer was so obsessed with
us getting signed. We spent all our
time thinking about getting bigger
gigs- all about the future. And now
the band doesn't even exist anymore.

world with it... are you enjoying
it?

JESSE
Not really.

CELINE

You know in my field, I see some
people that come into it like with
big idealist visions, of becoming
the new leaders that will create a
better world, they enjoy the goal
but not the process.

JESSE
Right .

CELINE
But the reality of it is that the
true work of improving things is in
the little achievements of the day,
and that's what you need to enjoy to
stay in that field. For example I
worked for an organization that helped
villages in Mexico and their concerns
was how to get the pencils sent to
the kids in those little country
schools, it was not about discussing
big revolutionary ideas about a better
world - it was about pencils. I see
the people that do the real work,
and what in a way is really sad is
that the people that are often the
most giving, hard working and capable
of making this world better don’t
really have the ambition and ego to
be a leader, they don't see any
interest in the rewards, they don’t
care if their name ever appear in
the press, they actually enjoy the
process of helping others, they are
truly in the moment.

JESSE
Yeah, that's such a struggle.

JESSE (CONT'D)
It seems like we're designed to be
slightly dis-contented with
everything. Always trying to better

@ our situation. You satisfy one desire

and it just agitates another. But
then I think, well, desire is the
fuel of life. Do you think it's
true that we'd never be unhappy if
we never wanted anything?
 

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 24.

CELINE
I don't know actually. Not wanting
anything... Isn't it a symptom of
depression? it's very human to
desire.

JESSE
That's what all those Buddhist cats
say, right, liberate yourself from
desire and you will find you already
have everything you need.

CELINE
But I feel human when I want something
more than just basic survival needs.
Wanting, whether it's intimacy with
another person or a new pair of shoes
is kind of beautiful. I like that
we have ever-renewing desires.

JESSE
Yeah... I guess it's just entitlement
that brings all the pain. Whenever
you feel you deserve that pair of
shoes, that your desires SHOULD be
met. It's all right to have wants
and needs as long as you don't get
angry when they're not realized.
Life is hard, it's supposed to be,
if we didn't suffer we would never
learn a thing.

CELINE
So what, are you like a Buddhist or
something?
JESSE
No.
CELINE
Why not?
JESSE

i don't know, it's probably like
when I go to a museum I don't get -
the headphones with the guided tour.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03

CELINE
I know. I decided a long time ago
that I wanted be open to everything,
but not buy into any one belief
system.

JESSE
I like that. I went to this Trappist
monastery @ couple years ago.

CELINE
Trappist?

JESSE
Catholic, Cistertian.

CELINE
Why did you go there?

JESSE
I don't know, I'd been doing a bunch
of reading, thought it'd be cool.
Have you ever spent time with any
monks or nuns?

CELINE
Not my style.

JESSE
I was shocked - I expected them to
be ail glowering and stern but they
weren't - they were quick to laugh
and really easy to be around, very
attuned to everything. They're not
trying to hustle anybody, they're
not trying to accomplish anything,
they are trying to live and die in
peace and be close with God or
whatever part of them they feel is
eternal - it's so refreshing to be
around. You realize that the bulk
of people that you meet are trying
to get somewhere better, make a little
more jack, get a little more respect,

have more people admire them... it's
exhausting.

CELINE
No kidding.

JESSE

And it's exhausting to be one of
those people yourself.

JESSE (CONT'D)
I'm at a monastery, greedy to be a
little more spiritual, "I want to be
a better person." You can't escape.

CELINE
I had a boyfriend many years ago
that wanted to be a Buddist and he
went to Asia to visit several
monasteries. He was very good looking
and everytime he went to one of those
monasteries a monk offered to suck
his cock.

They laugh.

He laughs.

JESSE
Well, it all comes down to that,
doesn't it? That's why I think I
really admire what you're doing.

CELINE
You mean sucking cock?

JESSE
No. I'm just saying it sounds like
you're not detached from the world.
You're putting your life and passion
into tangible action,

CELINE
I'm just doing my best.
JESSE
You know something?
CELINE
What?
JESSE

I'm going to be sitting down on a

plane and in airports for the next

eight hours or something. Would you -
mind walking around with me a little

bit?

CELINE
Are you inviting me?
 

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 27.

JESSE
Yes, let's go.

They stand up. He glances at the bill and takes out a five
Euro note.

JESSE (CONT'D)
Is this enough? Even for a tip?

CELINE
Yep.

They start walking out.

JESSE
Anywhere to walk to around here?

CELINE
t's sales day today.

JESSE
What's that?

CELINE
It's when everything is on sale in
Paris. Twice a year.

JESSE
Then let's go shopping.

CELINE
No, no, no, I don't want to inflict
that on you - it's madness. Let's
go up to the garden path - it's a
nice way back.

JESSE
That sounds better than shopping,
actually, not that I wasn't up for
doing anything you wanted.

They are walking, approaching the garden path.

looking and trying on things, I don't

No, I'm kidding.

EXT. GARDEN PATH STAIRWAY -- AFTERNOON
They continue their walk/talk.
JESSE
No, no, tell me the truth. Did we
have problems that night?
CELINE

I was kidding. We didn't even have
sex anyway.

JESSE
What? That's a joke, right?
CELINE
No, we didn't. That was the whole
thing.
JESSE

Of course we did.

CELINE
But we didn't. You didn't have a
condom and I never have sex without
one, especially if it was a one night
thing. I'm extremely paranoid about
my health.

JESSE
I'm finding this very scary that you
don't remember what happened.

CELINE
You know what, I didn't write an
entire book, but I kept a journal
and I wrote the whole night in it.
That's what I meant by you idealizing
the night.
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 29.

JESSE
(a bit louder)
I even remember the brand of condom
I used.

CELINE
That's disgusting.

Walking by are an older couple with three kids. They look
back, a bit shocked.

JESSE
No it isn't.

CELINE
Alright, when I get home, T'il check
my journal from '94, but I know I'm
right. .
{a beat}
Wait a minute. Was it in the
cemetery?

JESSE
Noooc. We visited the cemetery during
the day. It was in a4 park, very
late at night.

CELINE
Wait a minute.

JESSE
Was it that forgettable? You don't
remember, in the park?

CELINE
Wait a minute, I think you might be
right.

JESSE

You're messing with me.

CELINE
Sorry, no you're right. It's strange
sometimes it's like I put things in
drawers inside my head and forget
about it.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 30.

CELINE (CONT'D)
I guess it is less painful to put
certain things away than to live

with it.

JESSE
So that night was a sad memory for
you?

CELINE

I didn’t mean that night in
particular. I meant that certain
things are better off forgotten.

JESSE
God, I remember that night better
than entire years.

CELINE
Me too, I mean I thought I did.
Maybe I put it away because of the
fact that my Grandmother's funeral
was the day we we're supposed to
meet again.

JESSE
It was a bad day for me, but it
must've been even worse for you.

CELINE
Yeah it was unreal, I looked at her
dead body in the coffin, I looked at
her hands that used to hold me, so
warm, so sweet, but nothing in that
coffin resembled what I remembered
of her. All the warmth was gone. I
was crying looking at her, so confused
about if I was crying because I was
never going to see her again or never
going to see you again. Sorry to go
on like this, but I've been a little
down this week.

JESSE
why?

CELINE
Forget it, nothing bad, reading your
book maybe. Thinking of how hopeful
I was that summer and fall and since
then it's kind of... I don't know,
memory is a wonderful thing it you
don't have to deal the past.
 

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 31.

He laughs.
JESSE
Can I make a bumper sticker out of
@ that? MEMORY IS A WONDERFUL THING

IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH PAST.
If you wrote a book about our night,
that could be the title.

CELINE
Yes, I guess it would have been a
different book.

JESSE
It wouldn't have a sex scene.

CELINE
But you know what —- now that we've
met again we can change our memory
of Dec. 16th - it no longer has that
sad ending of us never seeing each
other again.

JESSE
Yeah, a memory’s never finished if
you really think about it.

CELINE
Yes I know, I have memories from my
@ childhood that I realized more

recently never really happened. My
mom was so paranoid when I was eight
or nine she was always warning me
when I walked home at night from my
piano lesson about dirty old men
giving me candies and showing me
their pee-pees.

Jesse laughs.

CELINE (CONT'D)
As I got older I had this image in
my head that this had really happened.
To the point that I associated sex
with that walk home. And now -
sometimes when I am having sex I see
myself walking down that street.

JESSE
Is that street nearby?

They laugh.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 32.

CELINE
Did you ever keep a journal as a
kid?

JESSE *
Yeah, I started when I was about *
thirteen. *

CELINE

Me too. It's funny I read mine from
"83 the other day. What really
surprised me is that I was dealing
with life the same way I am now. I
was much more naive and hopeful, but
the core, and the way I was feeling
things is exactly the same as it is
now. I haven't changed much at all.

JESSE
I don't think anyone does. No one
wants to admit it, but it's like we
have these innate set points, and
nothing much is going to change our
general disposition.

CELINE
Do you believe that?

JESSE
The older I get, I think maybe so.
I read about this study where they *
followed people that had won the *
lottery and people who'd become
paraplegics. We're led to believe
one would make us euphoric and the
other suicidal. The study showed *
that within about six months, once
they'd more or less gotten used to
their new situation, they were
fundamentally the same as they were
before.

CELINE
The same?

JESSE
Yeah, if they were basically an
optimistic, jovial person, they were
an optimistic, jovial person in a
wheeichair. If they were a petty,
miserable person, they were now 4
petty miserable person with a new
house, Cadillac and boat.

JESSE
Definitely. Are you depressed now?

CELINE
No. I'm not depressed but I worry
I'll get to the end of my life feeling
I haven't done all I wanted to do.

JESSE
What do you want to do?

CELINE
I mean J want to paint, write more
songs, learn Chinese, play my guitar
each day. There are so many things
that I want to do, and I end up doing
not much.

JESSE
Well let me ask you this: do you
believe in ghosts, or spirits?

CELINE
No.

Do you believe in re-incarnation?
CELINE
Not at all.

What about God?

No, no.

to be one of those people that don't

place here. And the more I believe
that, the more I can't go through

This is it. What do you see? What
do you feel? What do you think is
funny? Every day is the last.

call my mom and I tell her I love
her, she’s always...

"Oh my God, what's wrong? You've
got cancer? You're going to commit
suicide?" t's almost not worth it.

So what about us?

JESSE
What about us?

CELINE
For example if we knew we were both
going to die tonight...

JESSE
Like the apocalypse was coming?

CELINE
No, that's too dramatic. Just the
two of us would die, would we talk
about your book, the environment or,
like tell me what you would you say.

JESSE
If today was our last day?

CELINE
That's hard, no?

JESSE
I would definitely stop talking about
my book, probably drop the
environment...

CELINE
Okay.

JESSE .
I wouldn't mind still talking about
magic in the universe, I'd just like
to do it in a hotel room in between
sessions of us like, wildly fucking
till we die.

CELINE
Wow. Why not just go over to that
bench right there? Why waste time
going to a hotel?

her into his lap as she is suddenly overcome with shyness.

Well let's not forget about it.

CELINE
That was an extreme example but my
point was to communicate with people
is very hard to do.

JESSE
Yeah, most of our day to day
exchanges, if you think about it,
they're more like traffic control.

CELINE
iI know. For example, a friend of
mine was talking about she and her
boyfriend's problems in bed. After
they had dated for about @ year, she
started telling him things he could
do to please her, and it totally
freaked him out.

JESSE
Why?

CELINE
He thought it meant he was a bad
lover and was all threatened, they
almost broke up over it.

JESSE
Why'd she wait so long?

CELINE
I don't know, men are so easily
offended.

JESSE
More than women, you think?

CELINE -
Definitely on that subject. Plus I
think it is easier to please a man
than to please a woman.

JESSE
it's definitely easier to please a
Tan.
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 35A.

Depends, but generally yes. Can you
name the female mammal that has
opposing thumbs and is been observed
in the wild te be actively encouraging

its genitalia?

No, like a baboon or something?

herself, letting out a little primate shriek. They both
laugh.

is that I don't get wiser I just get
dirtier.

Anyway, my friend said the next man
she dates, before they ever do
anything, she's going to make a
questionnaire about sex - what each
of them likes and dislikes.

JESSE
Is it on paper, or do you answer out
loud? .

CELINE

Mostly written down, I think, but
not just yes or no. Like if the
question is, are you into S & M, you
can answer, "no, but a spanking once
in a while... doesn't hurt."

both become in the last 9 years.

At least now we don't have to pretend
that each sexual experience is some
life-altering event.

stuck it in so many places, it's
probably like, about to fall off,

a lot which leaves me free to do a
lot of things.

Isn't that dangerous? Seems like a
lot of those guys are getting killed
these days.

CELINE
He promises me he never takes risks,
but I often worry. He goes into
this trance when he starts to
photograph something.

What do you mean?

CELINE
Once we were in New Delhi and we
passed a bum lying in the middle of
the sidewalk.

JESSE
Bomb?

CELINE
Bum... homeless. it looked like he
needed help but his first reaction
was to photograph him. He took a
picture, very close to his face,
even fixing his collar to make it
look better. He was totally detached
from the person.

Well, to be good at that job, I'd
think you'd have to be like that.

Eventually they stand on the back of the boat, the
wind blowing, as Notre Dame looms in the background.

Notre Dame, check that out. I heard
a story once that when the Germans
were occupying Paris and they had to
retreat back, they wired Notre Dame
to blow up and they had to leave one
guy in charge of hitting the switch.
But the guy, the soldier, just waited,
sitting there, and he just couldn't
do it. When the allied troops
eventually came in they found all
the explosives and the switch just
lying there. They found the same
thing at Sacre-Coeur, the Eiffel
Tower and two other places, I think.
I always liked that story.
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 41.

Yes, that is a great story. But you
have to think that one day Notre
Dame will be gone. There used to be
another Cathedral there.

Right where Notre Dame is?

CELINE
Yeah. Everything passes. People,
buildings... You know what, I've
never done this. I forget about how
beautiful Paris is... Sometimes when
you live in a city you don't even
look at it anymore.

Yeah. I think my book was like
building something so I wouldn't
forget the details of the time we
spent together. Like a reminder
that once we really did meet, this
was real... this happened.

feel I was never able to really forget
anyone I've been with, because each
person has their own specific
qualities, and you can never replace
anyone, what is lost is lost. Each
relationship when it ends, really
damages me, I never really recover.
That is why I'm very careful with
getting involved because it hurts me
too much...or even getting laid, .
actually I don't do that. I will
miss of the person the most mundane
things. Like I'm obsessed with little
things.

CELINE (CONT'D)
Maybe I'm crazy, when I was a little
girl my mom told me I was always
date to school, so one day she
followed me to see why I was late.
I was looking at... chestnuts falling
from the trees and rolling down the
side walk or ants crossing the road,
the way a leaf cast a shadow on a
tree trunk, little things. It is
the same with people, I see in them
little details so specific to each
of them that move me, that I miss
and will always miss. You can never
replace anyone because everyone is
made of such beautiful specific
details.

Pause.

CELINE (CONT'D)
You know, like I remember the way
your beard had a bit of red in it
and the way the sun was making it
glow in the morning right before you
deft, I missed that. Shit I'm really
crazy.

JESSE
Now I know for sure why I wrote that
stupid book - so you might actually
show up at a reading in Paris and
I'd walk over to you and ask, "hey,
WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU?"

Celine laughs.

CELINE
Honestly, did you think I'd be here
today?

JESSE

i'm not kidding - I think I wrote it
to try and find you somehow.

CELINE
i know it's not true but that is
Sweet to say.

JESSE
i think it is true. What did you
think the changes were of us seeing
each other again?
 

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 43.

CELINE
After that December, I'd say almost
zero, but we're not real anyway. We
are just characters in that old lady's
dream - she's on her deathbed and
she is fantasizing about her youth,
so of course we had to meet again.

Jesse then speaks in a voice that is both louder and more
frustrated and desperate than we've seen.

JESSE
God, why weren't you there in Vienna?!

CELINE
You know why!

JESSE”
T know, I mean, I wish you would
have been. Things might have been
so different in our lives.

CELINE
Do you think so?

JESSE
Yes, I actually do.

CELINE
Maybe not, maybe we would have hated
each other eventually.

JESSE
come on, like we are hating each
other right now?

CELINE
Maybe we are only good at brief
encounters walking around in European
cities in a warm climate.

JESSE
Ahhh, why didn't we exchange numbers
and stuff?

CELINE

We were young and stupid?

JESSE
Are we still?

ELINE
I guess when you are young, you
believe that you will meet many people

with whom you'll connect with, but
later in life you realize it only
happens a few times.

And you can screw it up and miss-

a bit tense.

CELINE
Well the past is the past, it was
meant to be that way, no?

JESSE
Do you really believe that? That
everything is fated in some way?

CELINE
I think the world might be less free
than we think. That when given these
exact circumstances, this is what
will happen every time. Two parts
hydrogen and one part oxygen, you'll
get water every time.

JESSE
No - what if your grandmother had
lived another week, or died a week
earlier, maybe days, things might
have been very different. I believe
that.

CELINE
But you can't think like that.

JESSE
I know you shouldn't on most things,
but on this one, something was off.
Forgive me this, but in the months
leading up to my wedding, I was
thinking of you all the time. And
on the way there, I'm in the car
with a buddy of mine, staring out -
the window as he drove downtown. It
was raining, and I thought I saw
you, not far from the church folding
up an umbrella, walking into a deli
on the corner of Broadway and about
thirteenth. I thought I was
hallucinating, and now I know it
probably was you!
 

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 44h.

CELINE
I lived on fifteenth and University.

JESSE

eS See, I'm not crazy.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 45.

CELINE
{pause}
What is it like to be married? You
haven't talked much about that.

JESSE
I haven't? How weird. I met her
our last year of college and we broke
up and got back together for a period
of years. Then we were sort-of back
together and then she was pregnant
and ah... So yeah, marriage...

CELINE
What's she like?

JESSE

She's a great mom,- a good teacher,
smart interesting pretty. I dontt
know. I remember thinking at the
time that so many of the men I've
admired most ~ their lives have been
committed to something larger than
themselves.

CELINE
So you got married because men you
admire were married?

JESSE
No, it was more like I had this idea
of my best self and I wanted to pursue
that even if it might have been
overriding my honest self. It's
funny, at that moment I thought didn't
matter so much "the who" of it, that
ultimately nobody is going to be
everything to you and that it was
the simple action of committing
yourself and meeting your
responsibilities that mattered. I
mean, what is love if not respect
and trust and admiration and I felt
all those things. So, cut to the
present tense, I've had sex probably
ten times in the last four years.

She laughs.
JESSE (CONT'D)

You're laughing at me? I know it
sounds pathetic, but if somebody
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 46.

JESSE (CONT'D)
were to touch me affectionately, I'd
dissemble into molecules. I'm sorry
that's probably more than you want
to hear.

CELINE
Less then ten times in four years?
Do you masturbate a lot?

JESSE
Don't ask that question if you don't
want to hear the answer. I'm like a
teenager. I have to admit, in my
youthful idea of marriage, it didn't
include a lot of beating off.

They laugh.
16 EXT. BOAT DOCK -- AFTERNOON 10
They exit the boat and walk toward the street.

CELINE
I'm sorry you don't seem that happy
with your marriage - This friend of
mine, she's a shrink.

JESSE
How is she doing?

CELINE.
She's a mess, anyway she was telling
me that she's been dealing with a
lot of couples that are breaking up
for the same exact reason.

JESSE
Hmmm. What reason's that?

CELINE
All those couples expected after a
few years of living together for the
passion, that consuming desire, to
be the same as at the beginning. -
But it is impossible.

JESSE
Yeah I know, I know.

CELINE
I mean thank god otherwise we would
end up with an aneurysm if we were
 

Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 47.

CELINE (CONT'D)
in that constant state of excitement.
Plus we would end up doing nothing
at all with our lives. You think
you would have finished your book if
you were fucking someone every 5
minutes?

JESSE
I would've welcome the challenge.

CELINE
Your wife, it's natural after the
birth of your son, she has to give
all her love to the little one,
imagine if she was totally obsessed
with sex and forget about the baby
while she's ridding you like a wild
cat. I mean that wouldn't make sense.

JESSE
I know. That all makes perfect sense,
but it's more than sex.

CELINE
I know it's obvious but couples are
so confused now. Men need to feel
essential and they don't feel that
way anymore because it was imprinted
in their head for so long that they
had to be a provider. I'ma strong
women in my professional life, I
don't need a man to feed me but I
still need a man to love me and that
I could love.

They are now near his car and driver.

CELINE (CONT'D)
Well here's your driver...

JESSE
Yeah...

CELINE -
I guess now it's goodbye, no?

JESSE
Woah. Why don't we give you a ride
home or something.

CELINE
I can take the metro, no problem.

JESSE
Why not keep talking? My flight's
not till ten - they have me arriving
two hours early. I'm sure it's not
a problem.

CELINE
I'm not exactly on the way.

JESSE
It'll be fine.
(to driver)
Is it okay if we drop off my friend
on the way to the airport?

CELINE
Clest pas tres loin, c'est 10 rue
des petites ecuries.

The driver smiles.

DRIVER
Allons-y.

Jesse and Celine pile in.
INT. CAR -- AFTERNOON 11
They sit in the back seat.

CELINE
For me, it's better I don't
romanticize things as much anymore.
I was suffering so much all the time.
I still have lots of dreams but they
are not in regard to my love life.
It doesn't make me sad, it is the
way it is.

JESSE
Is that why you are in a relationship
with a man that is never around?

Celine is a bit stung by his observation.

CELINE
Yes, obviously, I can't deal with
the everyday life of a relationship,
we have this exciting time together
and then he leaves and I miss him
but at least I'm not dying inside.

She starts

CELINE (CONT'D)
When someone is always around me I'm
suffocating.

JESSE
Wait a second - you just said you
need to love and be loved.

CELINE

Yeah, but when I do, it quickly makes
nauseous. It's a disaster. I feel
really happy only when I am on my
own. Even being alone is better
than sitting next to lover and feeling
lonely.

{getting mad}
It's not so easy for me to be all
romantic. You start off that way
and after you've been screwed over a
few times you give up on all your
delusional ideas and you just take
whatever comes into your life. That's
not even true - I haven't been screwed -
over, I've just had too many blah
relationships. They were not mean,
they cared for me but there was no
real excitement or connection, or at
least not from my side.

JESSE
I'm sorry. Are you really that
unhappy?

CELINE

No, it's not even that. I was fine
until I read your fucking book - it
Stirred shit up. It reminded me how
genuinely romantic I WAS, how I had
so much hope in things and now I

don't believe in anything that relates
to love. I don't feel things for
people anymore. It's almost like in

a way I put all my romanticism into .
that one night and I was never able

to feel all this again. Somehow

that night took things away from me,
like I expressed them to you and you
took them with you.
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 50.

CELINE (CONT'D)
Somehow destiny not allowing me to
see you again made me cold like if
love wasn't for me.

JESSE
I can't believe that.

CELINE
Reality and love are almost
contradictory for me. It's funny,
every one of my exs are now married.
Men go out with me, we break up and
then they get married. Later they
call me to thank me for teaching
them what love is, that I taught
them to care and respect women.

JESSE
Yeah, I may be one of those guys.

CELINE
I want to kill them! Why didn't
they asked me to marry them, I would
have said no but I least they could
have asked! But it's my fault. I
never felt it was the right man,
never. But what does that mean, the
right man! The love of your life?
The concept is absurd. The idea
that we can only be complete with
another person is evil.

JESSE
Can I talk?

CELINE
I guess I've been heartbroken too
many times and then recovered. Now
from the start I make no effort

because I know it's not gonna work
anyway.

JESSE
You can't do that- spend your life
trying to avoid pain at the expense
of engaging.

CELINE
Those are words. You know what I
got to get away from you. Stop the
car and want to get out.
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03

JESSE
No wait let's keep talking about it.

CELINE
No, it's just being around you.

Jesse takes her arm.

CELINE (CONT'D)
Don't touch me. I'm taking a cab.
{to Driver)
Laissez moi au coin de la rue. La
ciest parfait.

The driver slows down.

JESSE
{to driver)
No, no, keep going.
(to Celine}
Listen, I'm just so glad to be with
you, and that you didn't forget me.

CELINE
No I didn't and it pisses me off.
You come here to Paris all romantic
and MARRIED. Screw you! Please
don't get me wrong - I'm not trying
to get you or anything. All I need
is a married man. There's been so
much water under the bridge, it's
not even about you anymore.
It's about that time, that moment in
time that is forever gone.

JESSE
You say all this stuff but you didn't
even remember having sex.

CELINE

Of course I remembered.
JESSE

You did?
CELINE

Girls pretend things like that.

What was I suppose to say, I remember
the wine in the park, looking up at
the stars fading while the sun came
up. We had sex twice you idiot.

Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 52.

JESSE
You know what? I'm just so happy to
see you, even if you've become an
angry manic-depressive activist. I
e@ still like you and enjoy being around
you.

CELINE
And I feel the same. I'm sorry I
had to let it all out. I'm miserable
in my love life, in my relationship.
I always act like I'm detached but
I'm dying inside. I'm dying because
I'm so numb. I don't feel pain or
excitement. I'm not bitter, I'm
just...

The car makes it’s way through the streets of Paris, Celine
and Jesse continue talking in the back seat.

JESSE
Oh God, you think you are the one
dying inside -My life is 24/7 bad.
The ONLY happiness I get is when I'm
out with my son. I've been to
couples' counseling, things I'd never
thought I'd have to do. Bought self
help books, lingerie, lit candles...

e CELINE
Did the candles help?

JESSE
Hell no. I don't love her the way
she needs to be loved. I don't even
see a future for us but then I look
across the table at my beautiful boy
and I think I would suffer any torture
to wake up in his house and be with
him for all the minutes of his life ~
I don't want to miss out on that.
But man, there is no joy or laughter
in my home and I don't want him
growing up in that.

CELINE
No laughter. My parents are still
together for thirty-five years - and
even when they have a fight they end
up laughing.

I don't want to be one of those people

down into tears admitting that they
never loved their spouse and feel
like they've lost their life into a
vacuum Cleaner, I want a great LIFE.
I want her to have a great life, she
deserves that. But we're living in
the pretense of marriage,
responsibility, these ideas of how
people are supposed to live. I have
these dreams all the time...

CELINE
What dreams?

JESSE
I wasn't going to say this, but I
have these dreams where I'm standing
on a platform and you keep going by
on a train, again and again and again
and then I wake up with the fuckin'
sweats. And then there's this other
dream where you are pregnant beside
me in bed naked and I want to touch
you so bad but you tell me not to
and then you look away and I touch
you anyway, right on your ankle, and
your skin is so soft and I wake up
in sobs and my wife is sitting there
looking at me and I am ten million
miles from her and I know something
is wrong and I can't keep living
like this. There's got to be more
to love than commitment. I have to
tell you I put the whole idea of
romantic love to bed when you weren't
there that day I swore it off.

CELINE

Why are you telling me all this?
JESSE

I'm sorry - maybe I should't have. .
CELINE

Isn't it weird that people always
think that they are the only one

Are you relieved that I'm even more
in deep shit than you are?

CELINE
Yes. You've made me feel better.

JESSE
Good, I'm glad.

CELINE
You know I really wish you the best.
It's not because I'm incapable of
having a family that I wish everyone
to be doomed like me.

JESSE

I'm sure you'd be a great mother.

Really, you think so?

A few anti-depressants and you'll do

She raises her hand and starts moving her fingers quickly.

Stop.

She does, with the middle finger extended. Then again (?)
They step out the car.
EXT. CELINE'S APARTMENT COURTYARD ~-- AFTERNOON 12

They get out at Celine’s apartment, near an arched entrance
to a long corridor.

CELINE
Here. I want to test something.

She moves over to Jesse and gives him a big, long hug-

I'm seeing if you are going to
dissolve into molecules or if you
stay together.

Jesse is almost shaking.

JESSE
How am I doing?

CELINE
Still here.

JESSE

Good. I’m liking still being here.
They slowly part. Jesse turns to the driver.

JESSE (CONT'D)
Je la racompagne a as porte, ca ne
vous ennuie pas trop.

JEAN
Aucun probleme. Je suis paye a

They start walking down the corridor toward a courtyard.

CELINE
So it is all really true about your
dream, or did you say all that just
to hopefully get in my pants?

JESSE
dust to get in your pants - I use
that all the time. God, you live
here, this is incredible! How long
have you been here?

CELINE
Four years.

She sees a cat lounging on the cobblestones ahead of them.
CELINE (CONT'D) .

Oh, there's my cat, look at him he's

so cute. What I love about this cat

is that every morning I bring him

down to the courtyard. And every

single morning he looks at everything

iike its the first time, every plant,

every tree, every little corner. He

smell's everything with his little

cute nose. I love my cat.

She picks him up and continues walking, they enter a giant
beautiful courtyard.

JESSE
What's his name?

CELINE

JESSE
Commie !

CELINE

Che, in Argentina means "Hey"!

Neighbors are organizing a picnic dinner. Kids run around
playing some kind of game. An older man sits with others
eating salad and Melon. -

building with a dish.

EXT. HER APARTMENT STEPS -- AFTERNOON 13

They walk towards her door. She looks up at the late
afternoon sky. They are on her doorstep. Moment of truth.

JESSE
You know what, I want you to play me
a song.

CELINE

But you'll miss your plane.
JESSE
Cimon. We got a little more time.
I'm going to be sitting around the
airport for well over an hour.
She thinks about it, wondering...

JESSE (CONT'D)
Seriously, one song.

CELINE
Ok, but quick.

She gets out her keys and opens the door.
INT. STATRWAY -- AFTERNOON 14

In the lobby of the building they are confronted by @ big
winding stairway with a little elevator in the middle.

JESSE
Tt love these kind of stairways.
What floor are you on?

CELINE
Third.

They start up the stairs, not saying anything, but acting
like everything is normal. As they continue in silence, the
charged undertone seems even more pronounced. Eventually
they reach her front door. She pulls out her keys and opens
the door.

She closes the door.
INT. CELINE'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON 15
He awkwardly looks around while she heads to the kitchen.

CELINE
Would you like some tea?
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 58.

JESSE
Sure.

As she prepares a couple of glasses, we see the details of
her apartment through his eyes. Some paintings, a picture

of her as a child, a photo of her with her grandmother. A
cat meanders over the window sill. He eventually comes across
an article and a picture of himself pinned up on a bulletin
board,

He notices her guitar sitting by the sofa. She walks out of
the kitchen and gives him a glass.

CELINE

Is camomile okay?
JESSE

Yeah, sure. ThankS. Merci.
CELINE

Messy? My apartment is messy?
JESSE

No - merci.
CELINE

I see your French has improved.

JESSE
Oh yeah, I'm practically fluent. So
what song are you going to play me?

CELINE
No, I can't. I'm embarrassed.
JESSE
Wait a minute. I come all the way
over here... You can't crap out on

me now. Anything will be great.

CELINE
Uhhh. Okay, but you're going to
laugh at me.

JESSE
I doubt it.

CELINE
Which one do you want? I only have
three in English: the one about my
cat, my ex-boyfriend or the one about
you?
Before Sunrise Sequel Pink Pages 24/8/03 59.

JESSE
Ahhh... sounds like a trick question.
Give me the ex-boyfriend.

CELINE
The ex-boyfriend, really?

She sits on the couch, all hippie style, and strums a
beautiful, funny song.

All Jesse can do is sit across from her on the sofa and smile.
When Celine eventually finishes, he applauds.

JESSE
Wheeeew! Encore! That was awesome!
Now the one about me.

CELINE.
No, no, no. Have your tea and then
you have te get going.

She gets up and goes into the kitchen. While she's in there,
Jesse pokes around through her cds. By the time she returns,
a Nina Simone song is playing and he is sitting on the couch.

JESSE
Is it okay if IT put my feet up?

CELINE
Sure. Did you ever see Nina Simone
in concert?

JESSE
No, I wish I had. I can’t believe
she's gone.

CELINE
I know, it's so sad. I saw her play
twice. She was great. This is one

of my favorites of hers.
The song begins:
"Just in time you've found me just in time

Before you came my time was running low
Before Sunrise Sequel Green Pages 21/8/03 60.
I was lost the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all were crossed nowhere to go
Now you hear now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt of fear I've found my way
For love came just in time you've found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights that lucky day”
CELINE (CONT'D)

She used to stop right in the middle

of a song, and walk from behind the

piano over to the edge of the stage.

Then she'd talk to somebody in the

audience. ~

{imitating Nina)

"Oh yeah, baby," She'd walk off a

Little, then walk really slow back

over to the mike. She had a big

ass, and this funny little walk.
Celine sort of hunches over and sticks out her butt a little
and proceeds to waddle slowly across the room. As the song
keeps going, and Celine keeps clowning around, Jesse just
sits there with the most peaceful, happy grin we've ever
seen on him.
"Just in time
Before you came my time was running low oh baby
I was lost the losing dice were tossed
My bridges all crossed nowhere to go
Now you hear now I know just where I'm going
No more doubt of fear I've found my way
For love came just in time you've found me just in time
And changed my lonely nights and changed my lonely nights
