OUT OF BLACK, WE SUPERIMPOSE:
The following story is true.

DISSOLVE TO:

IN THE DARKNESS

The SOUND of distant EXPLOSIONS: mortars, howitzers, “Long
Tom” artillery, 16” Naval shells, rockets, and bombs. The
sound grows louder. Nearer. Hungrier.

Over black, we superimpose:

Okinawa. May 2, 1945

OPENING MONTAGE:

We INTERCUT as necessary quickly between shots, the fury and
confusion of true war playing out in front of us, all froma
single soldier's POV. The sounds of war crash us between
flashes of consciousness.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE, OKINAWA - WOUNDED SOLDIER’S POV

--BOOM!!! We’re lying on the ground. Under grey, weeping
skies, a jagged, ancient coral outcropping abruptly rises
above us and dominates the countryside.

--Looking around the landscape a blasted, hellish mix of
craters, shell-pocked boulders, and mud. Everything has a
scorched and blackened appearance from two weeks of
continuous, unrelenting bombardment.

--A small group of AMERICAN SOLDIERS (307th Infantry, 77th
Army Division, lst Battalion, Company B) are fighting with
dogged determination several feet away.

--A few men run up to our POV

--Looking down at our leg, a mess of blood, muscle, and
exposed bone.

--Looking at our side and rips, covered in blood.

CAPTAIN
KEEP PRESSURE ON THAT WOUND!

The soldiers tear out bandages from a half-burned Medic Kit
and stuff them against the bleeding.
3.4.13 2.

A MORTAR ROUND lands nearby, showering them all with dirt and
debris. We black out.

--Looking up at two men carrying our body...
--Heading down a ladder

--We’re loaded onto a stretcher and shoved into an ambulance.
As the doors close, we briefly catch a glimpse of one of the
medics shaking his head at the captain.

The MONTAGE ENDS as we’re given a shot of morphine.

FADE TO:

EXT. BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS, VA - SPRING, 1927

In contrast, these mountains lush and green, thick with old
growth timber and flowering shrubs. Titles:

EIGHTEEN YEARS EARLIER...

Lynchburg, Virginia

EXT. LYNCHBURG, VA - SAME

Norman Rockwell come to life. Small wooden houses on the
rolling hills of the Virginia Piedmont, more country than
city. Two boys are rolling a coaster wagon through their
yard. DESMOND, the younger, 8 years old, pushes; his brother
MARK, 10, holds the wagon tongue and steers.

The wagon contains a collection of rusty junk metal. The
wagon is heavy and the boys small, but they’re tough and
determined. They’re like Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.

(NOTE: The real Desmond Doss, throughout his life, spoke
with the distinct accent of the Virginia’s Blue Ridge
Mountains, a lilting and beautiful usage that persists in
some places to this day. We make no attempt to render that
accent in these pages, but the presence of it in his speech
brought even more distinction and majesty to his real
character.)

Sitting on the front porch of their house is their father,
TOM DOSS. Tom is a big man, sullen man, broken in his soul.

TOM
What you boys doin’?

DESMOND
We're making money!
3.4.13 3.

MARK
At the filling station they’re
buying scrap metal! Any old junk
we haul in, they’1l give us cash
money!

DESMOND
We got lotsa junk in the back yard!

TOM
You know why they want it?

The boys hadn’t even considered that.

TOM (cont'd)
They sell it overseas. The Japs
and Germans make weapons out of it.

Tom rubs his neck, where there’s a nasty scar from World War
I. More than his neck is scarred--but his boys are
innocents.

MARK
Can we take it?

TOM
Do what you want. But when those
plow tips and lug nuts go whistling
by your ears, you'll say your daddy
was right.

The boys head around behind the house, Mark whispering to
Desmond--

MARK
Come on--he ain’t never right about
nothin’.

EXT. BEHIND THE DOSS GARAGE - DAY

The boys are digging through a trove of cast off parts from
old farm equipment. Then young Desmond spots a coin, and
lifts it, spitting on it to clean it. It’s a dime.

DESMOND
Look! I found a dime!

MARK
(jealous)
That’s mine.

DESMOND
It ain’t yours.
3.4.13 4.

MARK
I lost it, give it here.

He reaches for it--but Desmond snatches his hand away...and
suddenly the fight’s on. They’re real scrappers, rolling
around on the ground, punching, kicking, scratching. This
isn’t their first fight with each other.

Mark finally pins Desmond.

MARK DOSS
Say Uncle! SAY UNCLE!

YOUNG DESMOND
No!

Desmond may be younger and smaller but he’s every bit his
brother’s equal in grit and determination. He elbows Mark in
the face and shoves him off. In a blind fury, Desmond grabs
a good size rock and lifts it over his head with both hands,
no thought for what he’s about to do but...

...A LARGE HAND reaches into frame, grabs Desmond by his
scrawny wrist, and yanks him off his brother.

TOM DOSS (0.C.)
WHAT THE HELL YOU THINK YOU'RE
DOING, DESMOND!?!?

Tom stands over them, holding a kicking, struggling Desmond
up in the air like a bug. Tom folds Desmond over one arm and
begins walloping him on the ass with the other - big, hard
strokes which echo like gunshots.

BERTHA (0.C.)
Jack! That’s enough of that!

BERTHA, Desmond’s mother, stands behind them. She’s a small
woman but fierce in her own way. Tom looks at her with
defiance but he lets Desmond go, and the boy falls to the
ground like a sack of potatoes.

TOM DOSS
He was beating on his brother.

BERTHA
Beating on him doesn’t teach him
any different.
Tom waves his hand in half-hearted acquiescence.

TOM DOSS
You're gonna spoil him is all.
3.4.13 5.

INT. LIVING ROOM, DOSS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE TEN COMMANDMENTS

The Doss house doesn’t contain much art work, and this
wouldn't qualify as art to most people; it’s more like a
cartoon, illustrating each of the ten commandments.

Desmond’s eyes drift over the illustrations; but then they
settle on one that has particular relevance: THOU SHALT NOT
KILL, depicted by Cain holding a bloody club, standing over
the prostrate body of his dead brother, Abel. There is a
look of utter horror on Cain’s face.

BERTHA DOSS (0.C.)
Murder is the worst sin of all.
We’re all brothers and to take
another man’s life is the most
grievous thing there is in the
Lord's sight. Nothing hurts His
heart so much.

INT. LIVING ROOM, DOSS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Bertha kneels on an old worn sofa with Desmond and Mark
standing beside her. They are both looking at a framed
illustration of the Ten Commandments hanging on the wall.
Bertha turns and pulls Desmond down into her lap but his red-
rimmed eyes never leave the print.

DESMOND
Why did Cain kill Abel?

BERTHA DOSS
Oh, he was mad, I suppose. Or he
wanted what his brother had. It
doesn’t matter why - it’s always
wrong.

Mark is silent, but Desmond is transfixed, unable to stop
staring at that gruesome primal scene of the first murder.
EXT. DOSS HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - EVENING

The sun’s going down, and Tom Doss is sitting on his front
porch, bored and sullen. He reaches to the firewood box
beside his chair, and from behind it he draws a Masan jar

half full of clear liquid--moonshine. He takes a sip.

From inside he hears Mark's voice.
3.4.13 6.
MARK DOSS
Daddy?! Can we get down now?!
He tucks the jar away quickly and wipes his mouth.
TOM DOSS
Ask your Mama, she’s the one didn’t
want to whip you!
INT. DOSS LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Mark hops off the chair, leaving Desmond still in the
position where their mother left them. Mark heads into the
kitchen...

INT. DOSS HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

Mrs. Doss is cooking dinner as Mark comes in, wearing an
expression of exaggerated pennance.

MARK
Mama, can we stop staring at the
Commendments?
BERTHA
Commandments. Are you sorry?
MARK
Yes’m.
BERTHA

Tell Desmond.

MARK
(without moving)
SORRY, DESMOND!

BERTHA
Okay, you can go.

Bertha stands for a moment wondering why she hasn’t heard a
response from Desmond.

BERTHA (cont'd)
Desmond?

(beat)
Des?

She moves into the living room, and finds her youngest son
now standing, staring straight at the picture.
3.4.13 7.

BERTHA (cont'd)
Desmond?...

FROM THE POV OF THE PICTURE, we see Desmond’s stare, his
entire soul fixed on it.

He’s staring at CAIN, A LOOK OF HORROR ON HIS FACE at what
he’s done.

There are tears in Desmond’s eyes.

And BERTHA realizes with a certainty what she has always
suspected: Desmond feels things in a unique way.

EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS, VA, SEPTEMBER, 1941 - DAY
Title: Fourteen years later.

Lynchburg has always been a railroad town; tracks cut through
the gorges and span ridges.

Twenty-five year old Desmond now walks alongside the tracks.
He’s grown into a thin but wiry man with a pleasant but
crooked smile.

His senses are keen; he hears the chirp of a bird and his
blue eyes catch sight of a bright red Cardinal high in a
hickory tree. He’s a true country boy, at one with nature.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

Desmond waits his turn. Fascinated by all things medical, he
can’t help but poke around in the shelves and cabinets. The
door behind him opens and Desmond whirls around, embarrassed
to be caught snooping.

He’s even more embarrassed as sees his attendant is an
attractive nurse, DOROTHY SHUTTE, early 20's.

DOROTHY
Anything in particular you're
looking for?

DESMOND
No, ma‘am. I’m just kind of
interested in medicine.

He stammers slightly, with nerves.
DESMOND (cont'd)

I used dream about being a doctor.
But I didn’t get much school.
3.4.13 8.

DOROTHY
You ever given blood before, Mr...?

Dorothy consults her clipboard.

DESMOND
Doss. But my friends call me
Desmond. No, ma’am, this would be
my first time. When they made the
announcement in church about a big
car wreck and folks needing blood
SO...

DOROTHY
Just lie back here.

Desmond has no idea what to do--it’s his first time on a
hospital table. Dorothy is patient and kind, sensing his
country boy innocence.

Desmond watches EVERY DETAIL as she rolls back his sleeve,
dips a cotton ball in alcohol and wipes the crook of his
elbow with it. For Desmond, it’s almost romantic.

Then she wraps and elastic tourniquet around his bicep, and
slips an IV needle into his vein.

She notices that it makes him a little pale and queasy; she
smiles gently.

DOROTHY (cont'd)
You might be a little dizzy when
we're done. Is somebody picking
you up?

DESMOND
No, ma’am, I walked from home.

Dorothy watches the RED BLOOD, FILLING THE COLLECTION BAG.

DOROTHY
Where do you live?

DESMOND
Fort Hill.

DOROTHY

That’s a ways.

DESMOND
Just five or six miles. But I cut
through the woods. It’s seven that
way!
3.4.13 9.

He laughs. She laughs too.

DOROTHY
You must like the woods.

DESMOND
I always feel lost everywhere else.
But there I can find my way.

Dorothy takes this in; Desmond seems so simple, so boyish--
even backward. But something about him is deep, and poetic.
And unique. It brings out the sweetness in her.

DOROTHY
Well I have to tell you, Mr. Doss.
For somebody to walk ten or twelve
miles, to give blood to
strangers... I wish everybody was
like you.

DESMOND
Thank you, ‘mam.

DOROTHY
You don’t have to call me ‘mam.
It’s Dorothy.

DESMOND
Dorothy. Yes ‘Mam!

She smiles; is he flirting? She gets up.

DOROTHY
You’1l be done in a minute. We
have cookies and Kool-Aid. Help
restore your blood sugar.

DESMOND
Giving blood’s got all sorts of
benefits.

INT. DOSS HOUSE - THAT EVENING

Desmond enters, more exhilarated than tired despite his long
walk and the loss of blood but his face falls when he sees
his father sitting, slumped, in his rocker. He’s been
drinking and has fallen asleep clutching a pint of whiskey.
Not an unfamiliar sight. Desmond considers him a moment and
then gently tries to extract the bottle from his grasp. Tom’s
eyes blink open.

TOM DOSS
Excuse you?!
3.4.13 10.

DESMOND
You need some help getting
upstairs, sir?

Tom pushes Desmond away and rises unsteadily, still clutching
his bottle.

TOM DOSS
Not from you.

Bertha appears in the kitchen doorway, nervously holding a
dish towel.

BERTHA
You hungry, Tom?

Tom just glares at her and makes his way slowly toward the
stairs.

INT. DOSS HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Desmond and Bertha sit, eating a cold supper. She hasn’t
touched hers. Desmond silently reaches over and holds her
hand.

Desmond’s brother Mark strolls in the back door. He kisses
his mother and nudges Desmond's shoulder, sitting at the
table.

BERTHA (cont'd)
I was wondering if you were gonna
make it to dinner.

MARK
I went by to see the recruiters.

Bertha involuntarily glances upstairs, afraid her husband
might hear.

BERTHA
Your daddy won’t like that.

MARK
Daddy ain’t payin’ my bills. If
there’s a war they’1l need men--and
the paper mill doesn’t need any.

Mark digs in and starts eating. Bertha is distressed at the
news; Desmond changes the subject.
3.4.13 11.

DESMOND
Met somebody today, a nurse over at
the hospital. Her name’s Dorothy
Shutte and I’m gonna marry her.

Bertha blinks in surprise.

BERTHA
Goodness. Does she know?

DESMOND
I haven't gotten around to telling
her just yet.
Mark grins, and punches Desmond again. Desmond smiles...then
punches him back. The brothers laugh.
INT. HOSPITAL - NEXT DAY

Dorothy is working at her station when she looks up to see
Desmond standing there.

DOROTHY
Desmond?

DESMOND
Hi, Dorothy. How'd the blood drive
go.

DOROTHY

The church announcements worked
really well! We got more than
enough.

DESMOND
Well, that’s good. Cause I need my
blood back.

DOROTHY
You what?

DESMOND
My blood. I need it back.

DOROTHY
But...we can’t just give it back to
you.
3.4.13 12.

DESMOND
Well you got to, because ever since
you stuck me with that needle, my
heart’s been beating fast, and
every time I think about you, it
beats faster still.

DOROTHY
Is that a pick up line?

DESMOND
Is it working?

INT. LYNCHBURG MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

A movie plays on the screen as Desmond and Dorothy make their
way to their seats, obviously late. As they sit, Dorothy
starts to watch the movie. Desmond can’t help but admire her
beauty. He sits awkwardly, trying to find a way to connect
with her.

He tries to stretch and put his arm around her, but when she
looks at him he fumbles a bit to try and recover. She simply
smiles and takes a sip of her cola. Desmond sits in silence
again and then tries to have his hand brush up against hers.
As he does this, Dorothy preempts him and holds his hand.

For that moment, neither of them are watching the movie.
Instead they are both looking into each other's eyes.

Desmond slowly leans in and they share their first kiss.

Our music rises into a MONTAGE of Desmond and Dorothy’s
growing love:

EXT. PEAKS OF OTTER - DAY

Desmond and Dorothy hike through the park and look out across
the landscape.

EXT. PARK - DAY

Desmond gets onto an old rope swing just after Dorothy gets
off. As Dorothy begins swinging him; she sees Desmond notice
a pretty girl walking past. Frustrated, she tugs the rope
sideways and Desmond swings into the tree...

Dorothy stalks away after Desmond’s crash, but he gets up and

catches her and explains something we don't hear but
understand. Dorothy softens and smiles...
3.4.13 13.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

Desmond and Dorothy chat furiously across the table, barely
having time to take bites of their food. Something Desmond
says cracks Dorothy up.

INT. HOSPITAL - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Dorothy opens her locker to find an orange and a note from
Desmond. Her look of confusion on finding the orange turns
to a smile as she reads the note.

EXT. LYNCHBURG FOREST - DAY

The leaves are falling from the tress as Desmond and Dorothy
walk through the woods, talking. The MONTAGE ENDS as Dorothy
puts her head on Desmond’s shoulder.

EXT. NATURAL BRIDGE, VA - WEEKS LATER - AFTERNOON

A glorious late Fall day with just a bit of color lingering
on the trees. Desmond and Dorothy are walking with other
tourists, gazing up at Natural Bridge.

DESMOND
They say George Washington threw a
silver dollar over it.

DOROTHY
Seems like a waste of a dollar to
me.

DESMOND

I doubt anybody's throwing money at
it these days!

(more seriously)
The plant foreman told me the other
day that I’m doing such a good job,
they might raise me up a notch.
Salary too. Hope that doesn’t sound
too much like bragging.

DOROTHY
So, you’re gonna be a man of means,
Mr. Doss?

DESMOND

I’m a man who means to be one.

She looks at him, realizing he’s planning a future, one
that’s built around her. Slowly, happily, they kiss.
3.4.13 14.

EXT./INT. COUNTRY ROAD / DESMOND’S CAR - AFTERNOON

Desmond and Dorothy drive back to town - they are both aglow
with their love.

As they pull into town, Dorothy notices several cars pulled
over to the side of the road and people crowded around the
doorway to a coffee shop.

DOROTHY
Desmond...

She doesn’t even need to finish her thought; Desmond has
already started to pull over.

EXT./INT. LYNCHBURG DOWNTOWN COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Desmond and Dorothy join the crowd that has gathered at the
coffee shop, just within earshot of the door. Everyone looks
nervously at the radio inside, listening to President
Roosevelt.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT (ON RADIO)
...the United States of America was
suddenly and deliberately attacked
by the naval and air forces of the
Empire of Japan!

Roosevelt's speech continues as we CUT TO:

EXT. ARMED FORCES RECRUITING STATION - DAY

A long line of men are already waiting their turn to sign up.
We move through the line of faces, some older, some younger,
everyone wanting to do their part as Roosevelt’s speech plays
over. Men continue to join the line, some obviously have
come from work, both in suits and in uniforms.

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT (V.O.)
...-As commander in chief of the
Army and Navy, I have directed that
all measures be taken for our
defense. But always will our whole
nation remember the character of
the onslaught against us.
No matter how long it may take us
to overcome this premeditated
invasion, the American people in
their righteous might will win
through to absolute victory.

CEMETERY SEQUENCE...
3.4.13 15.

We see various CLOSE SHOTS OF GRAVESTONES, from a low angle,
jabbing up into the sky...

We PAN ACROSS them, a whole forest of stones, like a whole
army of soldiers who have become stone slabs as they died in
battle. We are...

EXT. LYNCHBURG CITY GRAVEYARD - DAY

The cemetery is in the very heart of the town, on a hill top,
surrounded by brick walls. And Desmond Doss’s father, Tom,
is standing among the grave stones.

It’s an old and seemingly haunted place where few people
visit; for awhile he seems all alone, until he hears--

DESMOND (0.S.)
Daddy?...

Tom turns around and stands silently as Desmond approaches.

DESMOND (cont'd)
Mama told me you wanted to see me.
Here?

TOM
Here. Yeah.

He walks away slowly and Desmond follows, completely in the
dark about why his father has made such a strange demand.

They reach a section of low stones, their perfect lines now
twisted by tree roots and time, their once-smooth surfaces
pitted by weather and pocked by moss.

DESMOND
Confederates.

TOM
Soldiers. Boys from World War One
are over yonder. Even got some
from the Revolutionary War on the
hill someplace.

Desmond's eyes lift toward his father, starting to understand
why his father wanted him to come here.

TOM (cont'd)

Look at ‘em. All of ‘em soldiers.
All of ‘em boys. And all of ‘em
dead.
3.4.13 16.

Tom sounds angry, and bitter, as he always has to Desmond;
but for the first time in his life Desmond hears an emotion
in his father’s voice too.

TOM (cont'd)
I don’t want my boys here. I don’t
want you here.

Desmond’s eyes meet Tom’s; there are tears in Tom’s eyes.
Desmond is transfixed.

DESMOND
Mark’s already joined up. The
Marine Corps--

TOM
I KNOW THAT!
(trying to regain control)
I know that...

Tom coughs--a wet, smoker’s cough that makes Desmond want to
go try to comfort him, but from force of habit he holds back.
Tom sags, supporting himself against one of the gravestones.

TOM (cont'd)
I don’t want you in this graveyard.
I don’t want you to go to war.

DESMOND
Daddy...

TOM

I know they’re drafting! But I
still got a friend or two! One of
‘em works at the Foundry, making
steel they use for ships and tanks
and such as that. They call it an
“essential defense industry,” and
they’1l leave you alone if you work
there. I can get you on. They--

DESMOND
Daddy. I already signed up.
TOM
What?
DESMOND
I talked to them at the draft board
today.

Desmond watches his father. He approaches him tenderly.
3.4.13 17.

DESMOND (cont'd)
Daddy, I--

TOM
Get your hand off me! YOU ARE
STUPID! DAMN YOU!! First time in
your life I give you the chance to
do something smart, and you do
this?!

DESMOND
Everybody else is--

TOM
You ain’t everybody else!
Everybody else jumps in and does
things quick, without thinking!
And soldiers who live, they live
because they can do that! You
can’t! You gotta sit and think and
pray about everything!

Desmond stands there trying to find words, trying to find
solid ground in this sudden sea of emotion.

TOM (cont'd)
You're doing it right now.

(beat)
You're a terrible son. I hope they
kill ya.

Tom staggers off, through the old headstones of the dead
soldiers.

INT. LIVING ROOM, DOSS HOUSE - DAY
Bertha sits crying, alone in the living room. She’s holding
something in her hands: pictures of her sons, Mark and

Desmond. Her tears fall on the glass of the frames.

Through the front windows she sees the back of her husband as
he sits on the porch, sullen, drinking.

She’s all alone.

EXT. TRAIN STATION PLATFORM, LYNCHBURG - DAY

The platform is crowded with young men - recruits - being
sent off by family, friends, wives, and girlfriends. Desmond
and Dorothy are embracing. The waiting train sounds a shrill
whistle - time to get aboard.
3.4.13 18.

DOROTHY
Are you sure...this is right? It’s
what you’re really meant to do?

DESMOND
I’m just sure I can’t sit back and
do nothing.
DOROTHY
(trying not to cry)
I know.
DESMOND

I am sure of something, though. I
don’t really have the right to be
asking you, and we haven’t known
each other for very long, but I
can’t imagine...

DOROTHY
Yes.

DESMOND
You don’t know what I’m about to
ask.

DOROTHY
Yes, I do, and the answer is, yes.
I do.

They kiss. Dot pulls out a small pocket NEW TESTAMENT and
hands it to Desmond.

DOROTHY (cont'd)
You keep this with you, all the
time. Promise?

Desmond nods and tucks it away carefully in his shirt pocket.
The train blows a second, final whistle and starts to slowly
pull out.

DESMOND
When?

DOROTHY
Soon as you get leave. Let me
know.

Desmond jumps onto the steps of the moving train. Dorothy
walks alongside, reluctant to let go of his hand.

DESMOND
I love you!
3.4.13 19.

The train is picking up speed. Dorothy has to let go.

INT. MOVING TRAIN - DAY

Desmond sits with the other young men as the train moves
slowly along the rails, past the hickory and oak trees that
line the tracks. They rumble over a trestle, and Desmond
realizes--

DESMOND
(to himself)
We're going by my house!

A thought strikes him; he looks around at the other young
guys.

DESMOND (cont'd)
Anybody got some paper? Anything?
Anything I could write on?

RECRUIT
I got some writing paper.
DESMOND
Can you loan me a sheet, I’1l pay

you back!
The guy gives Desmond a cheap tablet; Desmond tears off a
sheet and hurriedly pulls a pencil from his pocket to write.
He’s rushing--but he takes the time to write, with feeling--
CLOSE, THE PAPER:

“DADDY...I LOVE YOU. DESMOND”
CLOSE: THE STEPS OF THE TRAIN CAR AS IT RUMBLES ALONG
Desmond opens the door, braces his foot on the step, and
reaches down to the track bed; he deftly scoops up a large
rock, and wraps the paper around it.
EXT. LYNCHBURG RAILROAD TRACKS - IVY CREEK TRESTLE - DAY
The train chugs slowly over the trestle; Desmond, leaning out
from the train car, sees his house far below. With all his

might he throws the rock. It arcs through the air...

DESMOND
DADDY!...

But the train’s WHISTLE drowns out his scream...
3.4.13 20.

And the rock falls to the ground, just shy of the Doss’s
yard. Unseen.

Desmond sees that his message didn’t make it. He sees his
father sitting sullenly on the front porch, a disappearing
speck in the distance.

INT. ARMY BUS, DAYS LATER - MORNING

Desmond sits in an old green Army bus jammed with young
recruits, full of nervous energy and excitement. He runs his
fingers over the pocket New Testament Dot gave him as the bus
enters the gates of...

EXT. FT. JACKSON, S. CAROLINA, U.S. ARMY HQ 307TH INFANTRY

A sign boasts: Proud Home of the “Statue of Liberty”
Brigade!

Groups of sweaty soldiers run past, harassed by their
perpetually dissatisfied Drill Instructors. Desmond’s bus
stops and the recruits file out. Immediately, SGT. HOWELL, a
no-nonsense NCO from Alabama, is screaming at them.

SGT. HOWELL
WHAT’RE YOU DOIN’ STANDIN’ THERE?!
GET THE LEAD OUT! MOVE IT MOVE IT
MOVE IT!

INT. INDUCTION CENTER - DAY

Desmond and the new recruits are pushed and herded quickly
through a series of stations where they are thrown uniforms,
duffel bags, boots, kits. Throughout, Howell is continuously
yelling and berating the recruits.

Desmond is both excited and anxious - he’s never been away
from home before and never been around such a group.

INT. COMPANY B BARRACKS - DAY

Desmond enters his new housing. The barracks are stifling,
even with all the windows open. There are a dozen other
RECRUITS here, all men older then you might expect - the
average age is close to 32. Most of Desmond's platoon have
been here for days already and the men glance at their new
comrade with casual interest.
3.4.13 21.

SMITTY, a burly dockworker, is playing a knife game -
“stretch” - against “GREASE” NOLAN, another Brooklyn native
and auto mechanic. Smitty balances the knife with an ease
suggesting intimate familiarity and expertly throws it into
the floor, 30 inches from Grease’s right foot. Grease
groans. He has to spread his legs even wider to try and
reach the knife.

Try as he might, Grease just can’t make it.

GREASE
Shoot! You’re up, Kirzinski.

Grease moves over and another man, KIRZINKSI, takes his
place. Grease sidles up to Desmond and extends his hand.

GREASE (cont'd)
Grease Nolan outta Red Hook. Where
you from?

DESMOND
Virginia. Desmond, Desmond Doss.

GREASE
Hillbilly, huh? That’s Smitty
there, whipping Kirzinski’s ass.

KIRZINKSI
Like you were doing better.

Smitty says nothing but as the Alpha Dog in the bunch he
gives Desmond a very thorough if silent scrutiny.

“TEACH” EPSTEIN, a High School math teacher from Hartford,
glances up from his pulp magazine and smiles.

TEACH
Zeke Epstein. Most guys call me
“Teach.”

Grease steers Doss towards the back of the barracks.

GREASE
Think we got an empty bunk back
here.

Grease pauses near the corner where a group of men are
intently playing craps. MILT “HOLLYWOOD” ZANE, a
professional gambler from Los Angeles, rolls the dice -
sevens - and scoops up the pot.
3.4.13 22.

HOLLYWOOD
Seven is heaven! Come to daddy!
(glancing at Desmond)
Fresh blood! Care to sit in?

DESMOND
No, thanks.

GREASE
Not as dumb as you look! That’s
Hollywood Zane. Scott Drucker
there’s a genuine Mohawk from
upstate New York. Say something in
Indian, Chief.

“CHIEF” Drucker looks at Grease with undisguised contempt.

CHIEF
Ugh.

Mazilli, a big burly redhead with a thick Boston accent
reaches over and shakes Desmond’s hand.

BRUNO “B” MAZILLI
Bruno Mazilli. Beantown. Guys
call me B.

Grease gestures to the far corner where TEX ROYAL, a ranch-
hand from Abilene, is showing off rope tricks to VITO
RINNELLI.

GREASE
That’s Tex over there and Vito
Rinnelli. Here, I don’t think
anybody's using this bunk.

The barracks’ door opens and Sgt. Howell bursts in. Smitty
leaps to attention and yells out.

SMITTY
‘TENTION!

Everyone immediately drops what they are doing and stands up.
SGT. HOWELL
COMPANY B ON THE ROPES COURSE. FIVE
MINUTES. LET'S GO!

EXT. ROPES COURSE - DAY

The men are marched over to a climbing station where they are
each handed a rope.
3.4.13 23.

SGT. HOWELL
(yelling)

I am going to teach you how to tie
a bowline knot so you can get your
sorry asses down from a height so I
can kick it! Pay attention! Make
a loop. Run the tail end thru the
loop and around the rope. Run it
back through the loop and pull it
tight! Alright, let’s go!!

The men struggle to follow Howell’s instructions. Tex, of
course, is perfect but many are flummoxed. Howell walks down
the line, testing each knot. He tugs Grease’s clumsy
creation and it comes apart in his big meaty hands.

SGT. HOWELL (cont'd)
Congratulations, Dumb-ass, you just
fell fifty feet and broke your
neck!

Howell grabs Zane’s rope and the knot actually slips, closing
the loop.

SGT. HOWELL (cont'd)
Brilliant, Private Zane--you just
strangled yourself, numb nuts!

Howell gets to Desmond who, to his embarrassment, has
inadvertently doubled his rope and actually tied not one, but
two loops.
SGT. HOWELL (cont'd)
What’ve you got here, Doss, one for
each titty? You’re tying a
bowline, boy, not building a bra!

Desmond blushes and laughs at himself. There’s a good
feeling in the group, bonded by their mutual clumsiness.

SGT. HOWELL (cont'd)
You GRINNIN’ at me, boy?!

DESMOND
No Sir!

But he still grins.

EXT. PARADE GROUND - DAY

Howell double-time marches the men over to a rack of rifles.
3.4.13 24.
SGT. HOWELL
Grab a gun and fall in!

Everybody around him is grabbing a gun but Desmond just
stares at the rack, some powerful emotion working on him.

Irritated, Howell storms up behind Desmond.

SGT. HOWELL (cont'd)
Do we not have one in your size,

soldier?!
DESMOND
(quietly)
No, Sergeant. I can’t...won’t touch
a gun.

Everybody gets very quiet. Howell stares at Desmond in
complete and utter disbelief.

INT. CAPTAIN JACK GLOVER’S OFFICE - DAY

Glover, a tough, no-nonsense former Detroit policeman, is
Company B’s Commanding Officer, tasked with the almost
impossible mission of creating an entirely new unit from
scratch. His desk is piled high with reports, manuals, and
documents and the office walls are patchwork of overdue work
orders and tasks. At the moment, all of that is forgotten as
he tries to figure out the enigma that is Private Doss.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
What exactly is the problem?

Desmond responds respectfully, but we can sense he’s
repeating himself.

DESMOND
The Army’s made a mistake. I told
them when I signed up that...

SGT. HOWELL
(sharply)
“Sir.”

Desmond nods, flustered.
DESMOND

(to Glover)
Yes Sir. Sorry, Sir.
3.4.13 25.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
What you’re saying’s not possible,
Private. Do you know why that is
not possible?

DESMOND
No, Sir.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Because the United States Army does
not make mistakes. Therefore, if
there is a problem here, you must
be that problem and I don’t want
any damn problems in my Company.

DESMOND
Sir, I was supposed to be sent to a
medical unit, not a rifle company,
so I could--

SGT. HOWELL
--He’s a C.O.

Howell hands Doss’s papers to Glover who glances at them with
suspicion.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
You're a “Conscientious Objector?”

DESMOND
No, sir, I am a conscientious
cooperator. I volunteered for
active duty and signed on to be a
medic.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Are you screwing with me, Doss?

DESMOND
No, sir. I don’t have a problem
wearing a uniform or saluting the
flag or doing my duty; only with
the taking of human life.

Glover can't believe what he’s hearing.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
You don’t kill, is all. Any other
requirements? Anything else we can
do to ensure that you have a
comfortable stay here in the Army?
3.4.13

DESMOND
I’m a Seventh Day Adventist so
Saturdays are my Sabbath. And like
I was trying to explain to the
Sergeant here, I won’t touch a gun.
Sir.

Glover and Howell exchange looks.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Well, just so we’re clear, Doss,
let me tell you my requirements.
They're not as complicated as
yours, in fact, they’re really very
simple. As long as you’re part of
this Company, you will obey my
orders. Period. If you won’t do
it here, I can’t trust you’1l do it
in battle. I’m putting you in for
a Section Eight, Psychiatric
Discharge. Dismissed!

EXT. PARADE GROUND - MOMENTS LATER

26.

Sgt. Howell escorts Desmond back to the line, where the rest

of B Company are finishing calisthenics drills.

SGT. HOWELL
Think you're pretty smart, don’t
you? Come in here, make a bunch of
ridiculous demands, and think we’1l
wash your ass outta the service, is
that the plan?

DESMOND
There is no plan. I just want to
serve my country.

Howell studies Desmond skeptically, completely unconvinced.

SGT. HOWELL
Uh-huh. Well whatever your plan
is, princess, but you’re not gonna
get away with it. I guaran-damn-
tee you that.

Howell approaches the men with Desmond. Everyone comes to

attention.

SGT. HOWELL (cont'd)
(addressing the men)
Gentlemen! I want you to meet
Private Desmond Doss.
(MORE )
3.4.13 27.

SGT. HOWELL (cont'd)
Apparently, Private Doss does not
believe in violence. He does not
practice violence. He will not
even touch a gun. Private Doss is
a “Conscientious Objector.” Do not
look to Private Doss to save your
ass on the battlefield because he
will undoubtedly be too busy with
his conscience to help you!

By this time, everyone is staring at Doss with undisguised
suspicion, and open loathing.

SGT. HOWELL (cont'd)

I realize some of you may have
strong feelings about this but the
Government says we have to respect
Doss’ rights. It’s what we men
fight for: to protect our women
and children and those less able.
I will expect every man in this
Company to give Private Doss the
full measure of respect he’s due
for the short time he will be with
us. AM I CLEAR! ?

ALL THE MEN
YES, SERGEANT!

EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE - AFTERNOON

The men run the course, ducking under barbed wire, climbing
wooden walls, splashing through water pits, etc. Desmond may
be skinny but he’s all muscle and has no trouble keeping pace
with the front of the pack - a fact not lost on Smitty.

SGT. HOWELL
COME ON YOU MAGGOTS, PICK IT UP!

EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE - CLIMBING WALL - SAME

The men reach a sheer vertical wall with four knotted ropes
hanging from the top. Each soldier grabs a line and hauls
himself up, hand over hand. Desmond finds himself right
behind Smitty.

As Smitty nears the top he glances behind at Desmond,
climbing with surprising ease up the same rope just beneath
him. Smitty hesitates a fraction and then lets himself slip
down the rope eighteen inches, his feet catching Desmond in
the face and chest and knocking him off the rope and onto the
ground. Smitty grins and easily pulls himself over the top.
3.4.13 28.

Desmond pulls himself up off the ground, a look of
hardscrabble hillbilly determination on his face. He snatches
the rope, and quickly hoists himself up again.

EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE - FINAL TRACK - SAME

Smitty cruises up ahead on the final portion of the course,
victory assured. Desmond bears down and sprints full out
until he catches up to a very surprised Smitty; Desmond gives
him a sideways glance, and pulls ahead to finish first in the
Company.

Smitty is furious as Desmond leaves him in the dust.

INT. DINING HALL - EVENING

A cavernous, drab, pinewood room with long tables seating
fourteen men.

Smitty sits at the head; Desmond is at the foot. Platters of
Pork Chops, peas, mashed potatoes and corn are passed down.
By the time it reaches Desmond, there are only a handful of
peas and corn left. Uncomplainingly, Desmond fills his plate
with what’s left.

Waving one pork chop on his fork over the two other chops on
his plate, Smitty yells down the table at Desmond.

SMITTY
Hey, Doss! Sorry we ran out!

Desmond smiles back politely.

DESMOND
That's alright, Smitty. I don’t eat
meat.

SMITTY
What?

Smitty pretends he can’t hear Doss. Yells out to Teach,
sitting next to Doss at the end.

SMITTY (cont'd)
What’d the C.0O. say?

TEX
Says he don’t eat meat!

RINNELLI
Don’t eat meat!
3.4.13 29.

HOLLYWOOD
Not a meat eater!

From one man to the next, the word gets passed until it
reaches Smitty. Smitty looks at Desmond, at a complete loss
for words. Desmond smiles.

DESMOND
I like vegetables, though, plenty
fine. Thanks.

Smitty burns, feeling somehow that he’s been had.

INT. COMPANY B BARRACKS - NIGHT

In the precious half-hour to themselves before Lights Out,
the men play cards, read, chew the fat, or write letters.

Desmond reaches into his shirt pocket and retrieves his New
Testament. He runs his hands lightly over its cheap leather
cover; he’s in sore need of comfort.

A HAND reaches in and snatches the Bible away. Desmond jumps
up to see...

Smitty standing there, grinning, holding his Bible.

SMITTY
What’cha got there, Dessie?

DESMOND
That’s my Bible.

SMITTY
Seems kinda small.

DESMOND
It's just the New Testament.

SMITTY
Half a Bible for half a man?

TEACH
For Pete’s sake, Smitty, give him
back his Bible.

SMITTY
Shut up, Teach.
(back to Desmond)
So how come you don’t fight? You
think you're better than us?
3.4.13 30.

DESMOND
No.

SMITTY
What if you were attacked?

Smitty suddenly BACKHANDS Desmond across the face, staggering
him, and nearly knocking him down. Desmond touches his face;
his lip is bleeding.

The Barracks grows very quiet. Everybody stops what they're
doing and watches. A few more men gather behind Smitty.

DESMOND
The Bible says to turn the other
cheek.

SMITTY
Like this?

Smitty SLAPS him again, this time in the other direction.
More men gather. There is the smell of blood in the water.

SMITTY (cont'd)
See, I don’t think this is a
question of religion, fellas, I
think this is just cowardice, plain
and simple. Is that right, Doss?
Are you chicken-shit, is that it?

Desmond’s hands clench. It takes everything Desmond has not
to leap at Smitty and tear his throat out.

GREASE
Look out, Smitty! He’s getting hot!

SMITTY
Are you getting mad, Doss? Well,
go on, take a poke! Tell you what,
I'll give you a free shot. Go on.
No?

Smitty waves the Bible; Dorothy’s picture falls out. Desmond
reaches for it but Smitty is faster.

SMITTY (cont'd)
Hold on here! What's this?

DESMOND
That’s mine. Give it here!

SMITTY

Finder's keepers.
(examining picture)

(MORE )
3.4.13 31.
SMITTY (cont'd)
Hey now, this is a fine looking
woman. Kind of woman who deserves
a real man!

The men whistle and catcall.

DESMOND
Give it back.

Desmond has grown quiet...still...dangerous.

SMITTY
Please.

Desmond’s eyes are hard as mountain granite.

DESMOND
Please.

SMITTY
“Please give it back, Smitty.”

DESMOND
Please give it back, Smitty.

Smitty smiles slowly.

SMITTY
Nah, I‘1ll just keep it.

Smitty tucks the picture into his pocket. Desmond's eyes
dart up, full of fire--

And he sees Smitty smiling, waiting for him to strike back,
and abandon everything that makes him who he is.

Desmond lowers his arms.

Smitty smirks, tosses Desmond’s Bible to Desmond and leaves,
taking the crowd with him.

Desmond, left alone, shunned as a coward, picks up his Bible
and straightens the crooked pages out. A drop of blood from
his lip falls on the cover. Desmond wipes it off with his
sleeve.

COLONEL STELZER (V.O.)
Do you hear voices, Desmond?
3.4.13 32.

INT. ARMY PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - NEXT DAY

COLONEL STELZER is a pinched face Psychiatrist with a
receding hairline and a piercing gaze. Desmond sits in front
of him: nervous, angry, and defiant.

DESMOND
No, sir.

COLONEL STELZER
But I understand that God talks to
you. Is that right?

DESMOND
Look, sir, I’m not some drooling
backwoods idiot.

COLONEL STELZER
Is that how you think most people
regard you? “A drooling idiot”?

DESMOND
I'm different. I know that. I
don’t pretend to be something I’m
not. I am what I am.

COLONEL STELZER
Sounds lonely.

Desmond says nothing.

COLONEL STELZER (cont’d)
So you don’t hear voices.

DESMOND
I pray to God and I like to think
He hears me but - it’s not a
conversation, like we’re having.

COLONEL STELZER
So, God didn’t tell you not to
touch a gun?

DESMOND
God says not to kill. That’s the
Sixth Commandment.

COLONEL STELZER
I’m quite familiar with the
scriptures, Private. And most
people take that commandment to
mean, “Don’t commit murder.” War,
of course, is a completely
different set of circumstances...
3.4.13 33.

DESMOND
I don’t see it that way...

COLONEL STELZER
..-King David was a “Warrior King,”
and much loved by God.

DESMOND
And that’s the Old Testament! Jesus
said, “A new commandment I give
unto you, that you love one another
and--"

COLONEL STELZER
Jesus didn’t say anything about not
carrying a weapon! Did he?

DESMOND
No, sir.

COLONEL STELZER
Then why won’t you?

Desmond hesitates - then sets his jaw.

DESMOND
Because I won’t. Sir.

INT. COMPANY B BARRACKS - DAY

Desmond returns to his cot and finds his pillow soaking wet.
He can feel the men looking at him. Desmond wrings out the
pillow as best he can.

INT. ARMY PSYCHIATRIST OFFICE - DAY

Colonel Stelzer is now seated behind his desk. Captain
Glover stands at attention.

COLONEL STELZER
It is my opinion that Private Doss
is not insane or a malingerer. His
religious views are certainly...
unique, but they do not constitute
grounds for a Section Eight
Discharge. He is a legitimate
Conscientious Objector and he must
be allowed to work as a Combat
Medic provided he qualifies in all
other areas of his training.

Glover is dumbfounded - and furious.
3.4.13 34.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
And if I choose to appeal your
decision, sir?

COLONEL STELZER
(with an edge)
That would be unwise, Captain.

EXT. PARADE GROUND - DAY
Glover strides furiously across the yard, Howell beside him.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
We're stuck with Doss...unless he
requests a transfer. From now on
he’s restricted to Barracks and KP.
No leave.

INT. COMPANY B BARRACKS - BATHROOM - DAYS LATER

Desmond is on his hands and knees, scrubbing the filthy
toilets with a toothbrush.

INT. MESSHALL KITCHEN - FORT JACKSON - NIGHT

Desmond stands in the crowded, smoky kitchen, washing an
endless stack of dirty dishes. His hands are raw from the
hot water and bleach.

Through the window, he can see Smitty, Grease, Chief, and B
laughing and rough-housing with one another as they head out
of camp on a 24 hour pass.

Smitty and Grease glance back at Doss, silhouetted in the
mess hall window.

GREASE
What a weirdo, huh? Complete
fruitcake!

SMITTY
Shut up, Grease.

INT. COMPANY B BARRACKS - DAY

Somebody in the back yells, “Attention!” as Sgt. Howell
enters in a surprise inspection. Everyone leaps to their
feet. Howell prowls around silently, examining the barracks.
He stops in front of Doss’ bunk. Tugs on a corner.
3.4.13 35.

Dissatisfied, Howell yanks the entire bedding off the cot and
throws it onto the floor.

SGT. HOWELL
Doss, your area is a disgrace! A
pig stye!

Smitty grins. Howell turns to him.

SGT. HOWELL (cont'd)
Something funny, Ryker?

SMITTY
No, sergeant.

SGT. HOWELL
What you men fail to recognize is
that a unit is no better then its
weakest member. To help you learn
that lesson, there will be no
passes for anyone this weekend and
you will all be on KP! Right now,
I want you in full gear for a
twenty mile hike. LET’S GO!

Howell exits. Everyone stares at Doss with utter contempt.

EXT. SOUTH CAROLINA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Company B is in full combat uniforms carrying heavy backpacks
and weapons - except Doss, who is unarmed and unburdened. The
heat is stifling and the men are sweating heavily as they
slog through bogs and thick shrubs.

EXT. SOUTH CAROLINA COUNTRYSIDE - HOURS LATER

The men are in a state of collapse.

SGT. HOWELL
Take five!

The Company falls to the ground where they are; some are too
tired to even move into the shade.

TEX
Something’s wrong with Teach.

Doss moves to Teach - he’s hunched over, his face bone white,
his skin dry and hot to the touch.

TEACH
Headache is all.
3.4.13 36.

Teach collapses.

INT. COMPANY B BARRACKS - EVENING

The men wait, their mood sour. Nobody will look at Doss.
Howell enters and the men rise to attention.

SGT. HOWELL
Private Epstein is recovering but
he will not be returning to his
unit; he’ll be discharged. We lost
a good man today, through no fault
of his own, because this Unit does
not pull together; because this
Unit is weak!

Howell leaves. Slowly, every man in the unit looks at Doss.

INT. COMPANY B BARRACKS - SHOWERS - THAT NIGHT

Desmond is showering, as he does all things now, alone.
Smitty, Grease, and Chief enter. Just as Desmond turns to
face them, Smitty punches Desmond in the face, knocking him
to the floor. The other men close in around him and begin
kicking and punching. Desmond curls up and tries to protect
himself but he doesn’t fight back.

INT. COMPANY B BARRACKS - NIGHT

All the other members of the company sit on their bunks, not
looking at one another. The only SOUND is that of Desmond’s
beating in the next room. Tex curls up in bed and slowly
pulls his pillow over his ears to block out the noise.

INT. COMPANY B BARRACKS - NEXT MORNING

The entire company stands at attention. The door opens and
Sgt. Howell leads Desmond in. Desmond's face looks like
chopped steak: bruised and swollen, his eyes bloodshot. His
ribs obviously ache but he struggles to ignore his pain.

SGT. HOWELL
Last night, Private Doss was
assaulted in these barracks. I
want those men who took part to
step forward.

No one moves. Grease sneaks a nervous glance at Smitty.
3.4.13

SGT. HOWELL (cont'd)
Reese? Something you’d like to
share?

Grease shakes his head.

GREASE
No, sir.

SGT. HOWELL
Private Doss. Identify the men who

beat you.
DESMOND
(quietly)
No, sir.

SGT. HOWELL
You mean you don’t know who
attacked you?

DESMOND
No, sir.

Everybody is staring at Desmond.

DESMOND (cont'd)
I never said I was assaulted.

Howell is stunned; he doesn’t know how to play this one.

SGT. HOWELL
What the hell are you saying, Doss?

DESMOND
I just - fell, is all.

INT. GLOVER’S OFFICE - DAY

CAPTAIN GLOVER
I can hardly leave you in the
barracks; you might have another
attack of falling sickness.

DESMOND
I'm willing to take that chance,
sir.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
The men don’t want you, Doss, they
hate your guts!

37.
3.4.13 38.

DESMOND
Sir, they see me as responsible for
their loss of leave, their extra
duties, and what happened to Teach.
They’re angry about that - as they
were intended to be.

Glover and Howell exchange looks.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
If you’re accusing your Drill
Instructor of...

Desmond considers them coolly.

DESMOND
I’m not...sir.

INT. FORT JACKSON OFFICER’S CLUB - EVENING

Captain Glover shares a drink with his immediate superior,
COLONEL CUNNINGHAM.

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM
He’s an embarrassment! We’1ll be
the laughingstock of the Regiment.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
He passed his Section 8; I’ve
brought every pressure to bear that
I can and he just won't quit.

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM
You should court-martial him.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
For what? Doss is a pain in the
ass but he always toes the line.

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM
Then find a way to move the line.

Glover throws down his drink--and a thought hits him.
CAPTAIN GLOVER
He told one of the guys he’s
getting married this weekend, when
he’s on furlough.

Cunningham sees where this is going--and likes it.
3.4.13 39.

INT. COLONEL CUNNINGHAM’S OFFICE - DAY - ONE WEEK LATER

Cunningham sits at his desk, Sgt. Howell standing beside him.
A line of men stretches through the office as each member of
Company B applies for, and gets, his long awaited “Two Week
Furlough.” Bored, Cunningham glances at each man’s papers
and routinely stamps them. Until Desmond reaches the desk.

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM
Private Doss. I can’t authorize
your pass.

DESMOND
Respectfully, sir, I’m long
overdue. And I'm getting married
this afternoon...

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM
...-I’m not interested in your sob
story. You’re not rifle qualified.

Cunningham smiles, enjoying this.

DESMOND
I’m not required to carry a gun,
sir. Colonel Stelzer...

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM

Colonel Stelzer’s determination
was...

(reading from report)
“Doss must be allowed to work as a
Combat Medic provided he qualifies
in all other areas of his
training.”

(closes file)
You have not qualified on the rifle
range, Private.

Silence. Everybody in line - Smitty and the rest of Company
B - knows that Cunningham has put Desmond in a box.

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM (cont’d)
Show me you know how to handle a
rifle and I’1l sign your furlough.
Sergeant? Hand Private Doss your
firearm.

Sgt. Howell offers Doss his rifle.

DESMOND
Sir. I will not touch a gun, sir.
3.4.13 40.

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM
I am not asking you, Private. That
is a Direct Order.

And there it is.
Desmond doesn’t move.

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM (cont’d)

Pick up the rifle.

(Doss remains still)
I want you to think very carefully
here, Doss. Pick up the gun; get
your furlough and have a happy
honeymoon. Refuse to pick up the
gun and I will court martial you,
and you will spend the next five
years in the stockade.

Desmond is tempted but...

DESMOND
No, sir.

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM
Sergeant, you will note that
Private Desmond Doss has disobeyed
a direct order from his superior
officer. Arrest him!

Sgt. Howell leads Desmond out, past the other men of Company
B. Desmond neither seeks their pity nor their help.

Smitty watches Desmond as he is led out. Disbelief. Anger.
Confusion. What the hell is it about this guy?

EXT. STOCKADE - DAY

As the GUARD leads Desmond in, Desmond pleads--

DESMOND
I’ve got to make a phone call.
Please.

GUARD

No prisoner who’s been
insubordinate gets phone calls.
The Army lawyers will come to you.
3.4.13 4l.

INT. STOCKADE CELL - EVENING

A bare cell - a cot, a sink, a toilet. Desmond sits on the
cot, reading the Bible Dorothy gave him. Desmond looks at
his wrist watch: five minutes past six.

INT. 7TH DAY ADVENTIST CHURCH - LYNCHBURG, VA - SAME

Dorothy stands at the altar in her wedding gown, her parents
beside her. Next to them are Desmond’s parents. A tableau of
embarrassment and concern.

MINISTER
(quietly)
How much longer would you like to
wait, Dorothy?

Dorothy speaks without a hint of doubt in her voice.

DOROTHY
I think this is long enough.

The Minister whispers to Dorothy.

MINISTER
I'm so very sorry...

DOROTHY
I’m sure there’s a reason he’s not
here. We’ll call you on Monday to
reschedule.

INT. STOCKADE CELL - NIGHT

Desmond paces in his cell, his knuckles clenched white with
barely contained fury. Suddenly, the dam bursts with a SCREAM
- a wrenching roar of frustration and pent-up anger. He
grabs his cot and smashes it against the floor. He rips the
sink off the wall. He smashes his hands against his steel
door until his knuckles are bloody. Exhausted, he slumps
down to the floor.

INT. STOCKADE CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY

Desmond’s lawyer, CAPTAIN DANIELS, is a nervous young man
with a mustache so meagre it seems painted on.

CAPTAIN DANIELS
Private, outbursts like last night
don’t help.
3.4.13 42.

Desmond shrugs, sunk in misery.

CAPTAIN DANIELS (cont’d)
There is some good news. They’ve
indicated if you plead guilty, the
Army will give you a dishonorable
discharge, and you can go home.
How’s that sound?

DESMOND
If that’s the good news, I sure
don’t want to hear the bad.

CAPTAIN DANIELS
Look, Doss, Military Justice is a
whole different animal. We’re at
war! The needs of a Conscientious
Objector are hardly a priority.
Take the deal and be grateful.

INT. DESMOND’S CELL - DAY

Desmond sits on his cot, reading Dorothy’s Bible. The door
opens and to Desmond’s surprise, Captain Glover enters.
Desmond stands and salutes. Glover ignores his salute.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Sit down.

Desmond sits, uncertain. Glover looks out the window at the
parade ground, at the men training outside. He sees
Desmond's Bible; picks it up.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
This your Bible?

DESMOND
New Testament. My fiance gave it
to me when I joined up.

Glover shakes his head and puts the Bible back down on the
bunk.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
You probably think I’m a real son
of a bitch who cares more about
regulations then he does about his
men.

DESMOND
No, sir.
3.4.13

CAPTAIN GLOVER

Did I give you permission to speak?

(beat)
The U.S. Army didn’t always arm its
medics. Did you know that? The
Geneva Convention expressly allows
Medics to be armed and to use their
weapons in defense but some nice
fellow at the Pentagon decided,
like you, that he knew better. But
after we invaded Attu last year, a
thousand Japs armed with rifles and
home-made spears launched a banzai
attack in the middle of the night
directly on the hospital tents
where the medics and their wounded
lay sleeping. Our boys fought back
as best they could with whatever
they could find but hundreds died.

Captain Glover looks at Doss.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
I don’t give a rat’s ass about your
principals because the Japs don’t.
One of them comes at you and some
wounded soldier what are you gonna
fight him with, Doss? Your New
Testament?

DESMOND
With everything I have, sir. I'm
prepared to give my life for my
men.

CAPTAIN GLOVER

You don’t win wars, Doss, by giving
up your life! You win wars by
taking them.

(beat)
Plead guilty and I will see that
you receive an Honorable Discharge.
There’s no shame in that. Go home
and pray, and let the soldiers go
over there and fight.

DESMOND
I can’t do that, sir.

The two men stare at one another.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Guard!

43.
3.4.13 44,

A GUARD unlocks the door.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
Your hearing is tomorrow morning.
If I can’t change your mind, maybe
she can.

Glover leaves. Desmond rises, afraid to hope, but it’s true -
Dorothy enters the cell. Desmond and Dorothy eye each other,
unsure of how the other will react. Dorothy moves into his
arms.

DESMOND
I...you know I would’ve been there
if there'd been any way...

DOROTHY
What’d they do to you?

Dorothy sits on the cot; Desmond sits close beside her,
taking his swollen hands in hers.

DESMOND
I went a couple of rounds with the
wall and lost. Pretty much the
story of me and the army.

DOROTHY
They say you could go to prison,
Desmond. Leavenworth. For a long,
long time.

Desmond is nervous but tries not to show it.

DESMOND
I don’t think that’1l happen.

DOROTHY
But you don’t know it, do you?

DESMOND
I've come too far. I won’t quit.

DOROTHY
You tried, Desmond; nobody can say
you didn’t. Just say whatever they
want you to say and come home!
There’s plenty of things you can do
for the war effort at home.

DESMOND
I believe in my heart that being a
medic is what I’m supposed to do!
3.4.13 45.

Desmond realizes he’s raised his voice more than he meant to.
Dorothy is starting to seethe.

DOROTHY
This is just pride, Desmond! Pride
and stubbornness! Don’t confuse
your will with the Lord’s!

DESMOND
(reserved)
I could say the same thing to you.

Silence. Both are miserable.

DESMOND (cont'd)
I want to do right in God’s eyes
and - yeah, I may be - like you say
- prideful. If I am, it’s because I
want so badly to be the kind of man
you could be proud of. And I’m
scared of failing.

Dorothy looks at him - a mixture of love and pity. And then
she puts her arms around him and holds him close.

INT. STOCKADE CELL - EVENING

Desmond sits on the floor of his cell, alone, lost in
thought. He makes a decision, one that leaves him feeling
defeated. He rises and bangs on the door.

DESMOND
Guard! I want to see my lawyer.

EXT. PARADE GROUND - MORNING
Sgt. Howell leads Desmond to the courtroom.

SGT. HOWELL

You're quitting just in time, Doss.
Regiment's finally shipping out;
we're going to get us a real piece
of this war.

(confiding)
You know, some of us had a pool
going on you. Hollywood was giving
20 to one odds.

DESMOND
Where’d you put your money?
3.4.13 46.

SGT. HOWELL
Let’s just say, you had me a little
worried there for awhile.

They pass soldiers practicing BAYONET DRILL, lunging at and
clubbing padded wooden stanchions with their rifles while
their Drill Instructor urges them on. Desmond stops to watch.

DRILL INSTRUCTOR
Kill!

SOLDIERS
Kill!

DRILL INSTRUCTOR
I CAN’T HEAR YOU!

SOLDIERS
Kill!

DRILL INSTRUCTOR
IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?!

SOLDIERS
KILL! KILL! KILL!

Desmond regards all these young men, so confident of their
power, acting invulnerable--as if none of them will be
wounded, or killed.

Sgt. Howell tugs at Desmond's sleeve pulling him back to
reality. He follows but there’s a different look in his eyes
now.

EXT. DOSS HOUSE - DAY

Tom Doss drives his car up to the house like a madman,
leaving deep ruts in the muddy front yard. He leaps out of
the car leaving the door open behind him and the engine still
running. He hurries up the steps to the front porch where
Dot and Bess have been anxiously waiting for him.

DOROTHY
Did you get it?!

Tom hands her an envelope.

TOM DOSS
Right there. Go on!

Dorothy starts down the steps. Stops and looks back
3.4.13 47.

DOROTHY
You're coming aren’t you?

A flash of pain crosses Tom’s eyes.

TOM DOSS
No. You go. I...Tell him this was
your doing.

DOROTHY
But it wasn’t.

TOM DOSS
In a way it was. Go on...you’re
gonna be late if you don’t get
started.

Dorothy starts to turn away, but then stops again. There is
a gentle strength in her face, the kind particular to
Southern women.

DOROTHY
Mr. Doss... When Desmond and I
Marry, you’ll be my father too.
And I'm telling you: he’d want to
know this...from you.

A flash of pain shoots across Tom's face.

TOM DOSS
I’m no good at this stuff. You go.

With one last look and the hint of a nod, Dorothy turns back
toward the car and heads off.

INT. MAKESHIFT COURTROOM - DAY

A conference room has been hastily transformed into a
courtroom. The JUDGE, a JAG Officer, sits at the far end
behind a table on a raised dais. Desmond sits at a table
with his lawyer, Captain Daniels. The Prosecutor sits at a
nearby table next to Colonel Cunningham and Captain Glover.
Cunningham looks very pleased. Glover, on the other hand, is
oddly subdued. MP’s flank the doors. There are a handful of
chairs in the back - empty. Desmond looks around in vain for
Dorothy, but she is not there. Nobody is there for him.

JUDGE
This is a hearing into the matter
of Private Desmond Doss. The
charge is Disobeying a Direct Order
from his Commanding Officer. How
says the Defendant?
3.4.13

Captain Daniels rises.

CAPTAIN DANIELS
May it please the court, Private
Doss is prepared to enter a Guilty
plea.

JUDGE
Is that so, Private?

A moment. Desmond rises slowly.

DESMOND
No, sir. I’ve changed my mind.

There is an unpleasant stir in the courtroom.
JUDGE

You wish to proceed with a Court
Martial?

Desmond’s lawyer, Captain Daniels, whispers to him--

CAPTAIN DANIELS
Doss, what the hell are you--

DESMOND
(ignoring Daniels; to the
Judge)
If you say so.

JUDGE
This is not a game, Private. Your
lawyer has acquainted you with all
of the possible consequences?

DESMOND
Yes, sir.

JUDGE
Very well. Do you deny disobeying
Colonel Cunningham’s order?

DESMOND
No, sir.

JUDGE
It would seem you leave the court
with very limited options.
(a moment)
Why is it so important to you,
given your refusal to even touch a
gun, to serve in a combat unit?

48.
3.4.13 49,

Desmond takes a breath and wipes his sweaty hands on his
pants. He’s working this out on his feet; trying to give
form to his feelings.

DESMOND
When the Japs attacked Pearl
Harbor, I took it personally.
Everyone I knew was on fire to join
up. Two men in my home town who
were declared 4-F killed themselves
because they couldn’t serve. I had
a job in a defense plant and
could've taken a deferment but it
didn’t seem right.

It didn’t seem right to me that
other folks should fight and die
for my rights, including my right
to believe what I believe. Being a
medic seems perfect. I'’11 be right
in the middle with the other guys,
no less danger, but instead of
taking life, I’1l be saving it.
With the world so set on tearing
itself apart, it doesn’t seem such
a bad thing to me to want to put a
little bit of it back together.

The men in the court can’t embrace Desmond’s position, but
they can’t deny his sincerity.

DESMOND (cont'd)
All I’ve ever wanted was a chance
to serve my country and to protect
my fellow soldiers.

The Judge frowns.

JUDGE
While the sentiments expressed are
laudable, the facts of the case
seem incontestable. I have no
choice but to recommend we go
forward...

The door opens and Dorothy enters. She spots Desmond and
rushes past the startled guards to him and his lawyer. She
hands the envelope to Captain Daniels.

JUDGE (cont'd)
How did this woman get in here?
Guards!
3.4.13 50.

The MPs close in. Daniels rises, Dorothy's open envelope in
his hand.

CAPTAIN DANIELS
Your Honor! I have a letter here!
From Washington!

The Judge beckons and Daniels hands him the letter. The
Judge reads it. He glances up at Desmond.

JUDGE
(reading aloud)

“The defendant’s rights as a
Conscientious Objector are
protected by an Act of Congress and
he cannot be compelled to waive
those rights. That includes his
refusal to bear arms of any kind.”
Signed by the War Services
Commander, Washington, D.C.

A stake through the heart of the charges against Desmopnd.
The Judge looks over at Cunningham and Glover.

JUDGE (cont'd)
We could proceed, of course, should
the Colonel insist...?

Colonel Cunningham rises stiffly.

COLONEL CUNNINGHAM
I withdraw the charges, sir.

JUDGE
Then this case is dismissed.
Private Doss, you may resume your
duties and begin training as a
combat medic.

As the courtroom clears, Desmond hugs Dorothy.

DESMOND
How did you do this?!

Over her shoulder, Desmond catches a glance from Glover -
there is no look of forgiveness on his face, nor any signs of
forgetting this defeat.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Desmond lies in bed, absently toying with the WEDDING RING
that now graces his left hand.
3.4.13 51.

Dorothy turns off the light in the bathroom and climbs into
bed, wearing a nightgown and her own ring. They hold each
other a moment and savor the look in each other’s eyes.

DOROTHY
Now, I haven't changed my mind
about what you’re doing and I don’t
want you to go. But I love you and
if you really think this is what
you’re meant to do, then that’s the
way it is. Only...

DESMOND
What?

DOROTHY
You don’t come home to me and I’11
make you sorry you were ever born.

Dorothy tries to smile but her tears betray her and then
Desmond’s mouth is kissing her and they are lost in each
other.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. A ROAD - OKINAWA - MORNING
Titles: OKINAWA. APRIL, 1945

The Liberty Division has finally made it into combat, but
their war shows little excitement and even less glory. A
cold, heavy rain dampens spirits and turns the primitive road
into a morass of mud. Company B slogs through the mire as
they try to get up to the front line.

Desmond walks in the rear - alone - the Red Cross insignia on
his arm and his helmet evidence that he is now, finally, a
Medic. He carries a full field backpack plus three plasma
sets, a surgical kit, and two canteens, one full of water and
one full of rubbing alcohol.

Desmond’s training hasn’t brought him any closer to the men,
who still noticeably shun him. And he remains the only man
among them, indeed the only man in the entire US army, who is
unarmed.

Bruno shifts the heavy Flamethrower equipment on his back.
BRUNO “B” MAZILLI

Thought the Pacific was supposed to
be warm.
3.4.13 52.

RENNELLI
That's what that zippo on your back
is for.

On either side of the road, the soil is deep red. Rice
paddies and cornfields alternate between low pine-covered
limestone and ancient coral ridges.

SMITTY
Doesn’t look a whole lot different
than South Carolina.

Chief points at an elaborate womb-shaped rock structure on
one hill.

CHIEF
Won't see that in South Carolina -
that’s an Okinawan tomb.

KIRZINKSI
How come they don’t bury their dead
like decent people?

Chief shrugs. A sudden DISTANT RUMBLE of artillery pierces
the air and every man perks up.

JON KIRZINKSI
(nervously)
Ours or theirs?

The men up ahead in the line are stepping over to the side of
the road. Horns of approaching trucks are heard honking
loudly.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Give’em room! Make way!

Company B huddles miserably off the road as a convoy of ARMY
TRUCKS rumbles past them in the opposite direction.

The first trucks are loaded with AMERICAN SOLDIERS, gaunt,
and haunted-looking. Their clothes are tattered and filthy
but much worse is the vacant look of misery in their eyes.

HOLLYWOOD
Who’s that?

CAPTAIN GLOVER
The 96th; what’s left of them. The
guys we're replacing.

The trucks keep coming by, one after another, full of silent
men with ghostly pallor and dazed faces.
3.4.13 53.

GREASE

How long were they on the line?
SMITTY

Two weeks.
JON KIRZINKSI

Jesus.

And then the last five trucks pass by - full of DEAD
SOLDIERS, each man draped in his own damp poncho and then
stacked like wood, four feet high.

The men get very quiet. Desmond takes off his helmet and the
others follow suit. The rain beats down on their bare heads
and runs off their ponchos. The last truck rumbles past.
There is only the SOUND of the wind and the rain.

Captain Glover steps back into the road.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
(very subdued)
Let's go.

EXT. OKINAWA FARMHOUSE - THAT EVENING

Company B enters a typical Okinawan farmstead: low stone wall
surrounding a central building with a heavy tile roof and
upswept eaves. It appears abandoned, pock marked by mortar
rounds and machine gun fire, but nobody is taking any
chances.

The men move cautiously, guns ready. SERGEANT JONES hurries
up alongside Glover.

SGT. JONES
Sir, we got three Nips coming in,
want to surrender. One of ‘em looks
like he might be an officer.

Glover, Doss, Smitty and several others follow Sgt. Jones out
the rear entrance of the compound to the edge of...

EXT. HALF-PLOWED FIELD - EVENING

A group of soldiers stand watching in amusement as three
JAPANESE SOLDIERS approach - one riding a bicycle, one
sitting on the handlebars, and the third running alongside
holding a large WHITE FLAG.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Hold your fire!
3.4.13 54.

Several of the US soldiers look back to Glover in confusion.
A few wave their arms at the Japanese to halt. As the
Japanese get within fifteen yards they abruptly stop and
abandon the bicycle. All of them pull out GRENADES and throw
them at the Americans! The grenades explode and
simultaneously the Americans open up. In the brief fire-
fight, five American soldiers are wounded and all three
Japanese go down.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
Cease Fire! Medic!

It was all so fast; Desmond can hardly believe it.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (0.C.) (cont'd)
MEDIC!

Desmond grabs his kit and hurries towards the closest wounded
American.

It’s not until he’s almost on him that he can see it’s
actually two men - Bruno, with a gaping stomach wound, and
lying beside him, Kirzinski, dead, his sightless eyes staring
up at the sky. His first combat casualties.

The classroom can’t prepare you for this: the smell of
burning flesh; the sight of arterial blood seeping into the
ground; the pitiful SOUND of men whimpering with pain.
Desmond takes a hurried breath and checks the Bruno’s pulse.

DESMOND
B?

BRUNO “B” MAZILLI
Is that you, Doss?

DESMOND
Don’t speak. Save your breath.

Desmond starts to cut away Bruno’s clothes to get at his
wound. Bruno is badly rattled, shaking with pain and terror;
the look on Desmond’s face isn’t comforting.

BRUNO “B” MAZILLI

(whispering)
It wasn’t - like - they said it -
would be.

Desmond stops, confused, for only a moment as Bruno’s eyes
roll back in his head.

DESMOND
He’s going into shock!
3.4.13 55.

Desmond quickly injects Bruno with morphine and then wraps a
tourniquet around his upper arm. He pulls out a plasma unit -
a box with two bottles and a two way needle - and connects

the bottles with the needle. While the liquid is filling the
dried plasma, Desmond pulls out a sterile IV kit and sets it
up. He inserts one end into the now liquid plasma and the
other into Bruno’s arm. Desmond releases the tourniquet and
the plasma begins to flow into the patient.

Desmond waits an anxious moment and then, as the color
returns to Bruno’s face, he breathes a sigh of relief.

DESMOND (cont'd)
STRETCHER TEAM!

A Two Man stretcher team runs up. Desmond watches them load
his patient and carry him away. Only then does Desmond
realize how much his hands are shaking.

EXT. OKINAWA FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

As the last of the American wounded are evacuated, Desmond
moves to the Japanese bodies. To his surprise, one of them
is still alive.

It is Desmond's first glimpse of the enemy and despite the
treachery of their assault, this soldier does not appear
formidable. The Japanese Soldier looks young, barely out of
his teens, and so malnourished he’s more skin and bones than
anything else. Blood bubbles at the corners of his mouth.
He looks at Desmond with absolute terror in his eyes.

Desmond doesn’t hesitate, he squats down beside the wounded
soldier and starts to treat his wounds.

SMITTY (0.C.)
Leave him be.

Desmond looks up in surprise at Smitty standing over him,
service revolver drawn, glowering at the wounded Japanese
soldier. Glover strides over.

CAPTAIN GLOVER

Sons of bitches came in under a
white flag.

(to everyone)
No more prisoners! Ever. You get
a clean shot on one of them, you
take it!

(to Desmond)
Leave him alone.
3.4.13 56.

DESMOND
(quietly)
It’s my job, sir; take care of the
wounded.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Not these wounded.

BOOM! Smitty shoots the wounded Japanese soldier at such
close range that flecks of blood spatter Desmond.

Glover has already begun to walk off. Smitty looks at
Desmond.

SMITTY
He’s all yours now.

EXT. OKINAWA FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Nervous sentries guard the farmhouse perimeter in two man
foxholes. It’s pitch black out and the night is foggy, even
further obscuring vision.

INT. OKINAWA FARMHOUSE - SAME

Those men not on duty - including Smitty - sit together and
eat dinner or smoke.

Desmond sits by himself, ignored by the rest of the company,
eating cold K rations.

The door opens and another soldier, Schecter, enters.
Schecter is clearly a veteran; he looks ragged and beat but
he has a warm, engaging manner. He carries the equipment of
a medic but wears none of the identifying insignia. Irv
glances around until he spots Desmond and then comes over to
him, hand extended.

SCHECTER
You Doss? Irv Schecter out of the
96th. You and me are the only
medics they got now in this area so
it looks like we’re gonna be
working together.

SMITTY
The 96th? You just come off the
line?

Schecter barely nods, ignoring Smitty, and hands Desmond a
medical supply package which Desmond starts to open.
3.4.13 57.

SMITTY (cont'd)
What’s it like up there?

Schecter finally turns to face Smitty. He considers hima
minute, something flinty in his gaze that makes even Smitty
uncomfortable.

SCHECTER
“Hacksaw Ridge.” That’s where it’s
all happening right now. They
threw us off it six times and after
the last time there wasn’t anything
left of the 96th.

Smitty and the rest of the men are silent. Desmond now has
the package open to reveal bandages and surgical dressings -
which are all brown instead of white.

DESMOND
Are these bandages OK?

Irv turns back to Desmond.

SCHECTER
They're sterile, if that’s what you
mean. We started out using regular
white bandages but they show up too
easy and the Japs deliberately
target the wounded. And take off
all your Red Cross markings and put
some tape over your helmet. Japs
put a premium on shooting medics.
They’11l let a whole squad go by
just to get a clean shot at one of
us.

DESMOND
How come?

SCHECTER
‘Cause they’re animals. I’ve seen
them fake being wounded, calling
out “Medic!” just to lure you in.
Then...

Schecter makes a slashing motion across his throat.

SCHECTER (cont'd)
There isn’t any Geneva convention
out there. There aren’t any rules
at all.

The men all look at one another. Schecter hands Desmond a
roll of black tape.
3.4.13 58.

EXT. ROAD HEADING SOUTH - DAY

It's a very different Company on the march today. Several
men have been killed or wounded and the true nature of the
abyss which yawns before them has been glimpsed. Desmond
glances up at the terrain around them.

They are crossing an open valley, half a mile wide. A series
of gradual slopes lead to their ultimate objective up ahead:
a long, high rocky escarpment:

HACKSAW RIDGE

The jagged Ridge runs west, to their right, all the way to
the sea. The top of the ridge is protected by a SHEER CLIFF
which is 70 feet high.

At the eastern end of the ridge, to the Company’s left, is a
series of sharp ROCK PINNACLES, 480-500 feet tall, which
dominate the entire formation.

With the sun behind it, throwing its enormous shadow out
towards the men, the entire structure feels oppressive and
malevolent.

The Company has stopped - every man in it absorbing their
first glance of the obstacle ahead.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Let's go!

The Company reluctantly begins to move forward.

They come upon the first of several unburied JAPANESE CORPSES-
-bloated, decomposing bodies drawing clouds of flies. Their
faces are stretched tight, jaws open, as if the dead are
still screaming.

A cloud-like dread begins to descend on the men.

Desmond notices the FOOTPRINTS of Rennelli in front of him.
The stream trickling down the middle of the road is changing
color, getting redder. Blood red.

And then it dawns on Desmond that the ground is so SATURATED
WITH BLOOD that they are literally walking through a stream
of it.

As every man comes to the same shocking realization.
HOLLYWOOD

Is that...? It’s not a stream,
it’s blood!
3.4.13 59.

RENNELLI
(crossing himself)
Lord have mercy.

EXT. 1ST BATTALION LINES - DAY
Titles: April 24, 1945. First Assault.

The First Battalion’s lines are 50 yards from the northern
edge of the Ridge, running from the Pinnacle rocks on the
left, to about 500 yards to the right.

Up close, the Ridge is an even more rugged barrier, actually
an ancient coral reef. Rain and wind erosion have carved
innumerable gullies, caves, and holes in the cliff face. Two
weeks of combat have left their mark as well. Whatever trees
or shrubbery once existed here, all that remains now are
blasted, charred stumps and blackened craters.

The men of the Company B have found shelter wherever they can
- some in natural defensive positions among the rocks, others
in foxholes they have scraped out themselves, or that were
left by the 96th.

EXT. 1ST PLATOON COMMAND POST/AID STATION - SAME

Captain Glover has set up his Command Post with the platoon’s
critical communication gear in a hole between two huge rocks
on the lower side of the hill. In front, charred logs have
been piled up and covered with dirt for extra protection.
Twenty yards behind the CP and dug in behind another pile of
rocks is the MEDICAL RECEIVING STATION, the first stop in the
chain of medical care for evacuated casualties.

INT. COMPANY COMMAND POST - SAME

Captain Glover has the NCOs, Squad Leaders, and Medics
gathered around while he goes over the plan of battle.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
The enemy will be softened up by a
mortar and artillery barrage. At
1700 hours, when those shadows give
us some cover on the face,
Companies B and A will assault the
ridge. A will take the pinnacles on
our left, while we seize the
section of the ridge directly in
front of us.

(MORE )
3.4.13 60.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont'd)
The two companies will then link up
on top and establish a new
defensive perimeter which we will
hold at all costs.

Glover hesitates.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
We need Okinawa as a staging area
for the invasion of Japan but the
entire movement of the Army has
been held up, right here. Our Navy
is stuck off the coast getting hit
by Kamikaze attacks and losing a
ship and a half a day. Hacksaw
Ridge is the key to their defences.
We take Hacksaw, we get Okinawa.
We get Okinawa, we take Japan. So
the sooner we get this done, the
sooner we can all go home.
Questions?

The men are silent.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
OK. See you on top.

Everyone start to leave.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
Doss.

Desmond returns. Glover waits until they are alone.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
That damn ridge has cost us so many
Americans we don’t even have an
accurate count yet. When we
attack, the only hope any man has
of surviving is to kill every Jap
he sees without hesitation.
Whatever nonsense you believe, you
keep it to yourself--and do your
job. You understand me?

DESMOND
Yes, sir.
EXT. COMPANY B LINES - 1700 HOURS
The men wait nervously in their positions, checking their

weapons and ammunitions. Some men have short six foot
LADDERS and heavy CLIMBING ROPES with GRAPPLING HOOKS.
3.4.13 61.

Over their heads, U.S. mortars and artillery shells arc in
and explode on top of the Ridge.

As medics, Desmond and Schecter wait the standard 10-15 feet
behind the men. They will follow the attack from this
position so they can better see when someone goes down.
Schecter goes over his supplies obsessively.

Desmond closes his eyes and says a silent prayer. Several of
the other men notice. Desmond whispers “Amen” and takes his
New Testament from his pocket, running his fingers over its
cover.

Suddenly, the artillery barrage stops. Desmond opens his
eyes and nervously tucks his Bible away in his breast pocket.

Captain Glover looks at his watch. It’s time. He hand
signals the “go ahead” to his squad leaders.

EXT. CLIFF FACE - SAME

With the SCOUTS, including Chief, leading the way, the men
move as fast and as silently as they can, scrambling over the
rubble at the base of the Ridge, hand over hand. This is not
the Charge of the Light Brigade. Every man is utterly
terrified and is forcing himself to move forward by a sheer
act of will.

TWO TEAMS set up ladders against the cliff face.
Immediately, two men with ropes climb to the top of the
ladders and toss their grappling hooks onto the lip of the
Ridge, trying to grab a secure hold.

Surprisingly there is little enemy resistance--only some
sniping and a few knee mortar rounds. One soldier goes down.

Desmond hurries towards the wounded soldier when a mortar
round lands nearby on the rocks. A handful of razor-sharp
shards of limestone smack Desmond in the right side, spinning
him around, and knocking him down to the ground!

Desmond’s hand and face are bleeding. He looks in wonder at
his own blood - half terrified at how close the shell was and
half delighted at the modest nature of his injury.

Desmond wipes the blood off on his own shirt, and plunges
back towards the line.

The soldiers swarm up the cliff face and finally onto the top
of the Ridge which is revealed to be a small plateau.
3.4.13 62.

EXT. CLIFF FACE - TEN MINUTES LATER

Desmond hauls himself up the last few feet of rope and
onto...

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU LIP - CONTINUOUS

The edge here is maybe fifteen feet wide and two to six feet
deep. Dotted with boulders and stumps of shattered trees, it
rises up towards the plateau in a small BERM. This tiny
protected area is all the shelter the plateau offers.

Captain Glover and the rest of the men are huddled behind the
berm, peering cautiously over the edge.

Desmond reaches them just as Glover gives the signal to move
forward across the berm and onto...

EXT. OPEN PLATEAU - CONTINUOUS

The plateau, seemingly open, is actually crisscrossed by
numerous cunningly hidden small RAVINES and GULLIES, and
still smoking from the pre-assault bombardment. There are no
Japanese forces or defensive structures visible. That
doesn’t mean they aren’t there. As Glover and his men move
out into the open, all hell breaks loose.

HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE from three cleverly camouflaged
positions rakes the top of the plateau.

Simultaneously, there is a shower of HAND GRENADES from
individual Japanese Soldiers hidden in natural folds and man-
made trenches in the ground, or popping out of camouflaged
“Spider Holes.”

Japanese KNEE MORTARS, 81 MM MORTARS, and even 47 MM guns
launched from positions hidden in the rear of the Ridge - the
“Reverse Slope” - fall among the Americans with devastating
results.

The Company responds with their own grenades, carbines, and
BAR but the enemy is so well hidden it’s hard to find a
target. Immediately, the Company starts taking casualties.
In front of Desmond, a SOLDIER takes the full blast from a
Japanese mortar shell and is tossed up into the air and
backwards, slamming into the ground.

Desmond launches himself over the berm and runs to the downed
man, ignoring the firing and explosions all around him. The
man has lost both his legs from the knees down.
3.4.13 63.

Schecter runs past Desmond and glances down at the wounded
soldier. He shakes his head.

SCHECTER
Waste of time! Come on!

The wounded soldier grabs Desmond's arm.

WOUNDED SOLDIER
Don’t leave me! Please, God, don’t
leave me!

Desmond leans close to the soldier - he can’t be more than
nineteen.

DESMOND
I’m not going anywhere! What’s
your name?

Desmond quickly injects the soldier with morphine and ties a
tourniquet around the stumps of his legs.

WOUNDED SOLDIER
S.s..s..Stevens. Private J.
Stevens.

DESMOND
Where you from, Private Stevens?

WOUNDED SOLDIER
Buffalo.

DESMOND
That's near Niagara Falls, right?
Always wanted to see that. OK,
I’ve got to get you off of here.
Arms around my neck; hold on now!

Desmond picks up the Wounded Soldier and carries him to the
cliff edge. Desmond looks down.

It’s seventy feet straight down. It didn’t seem so far
climbing up but it looks like the bottom of the Grand Canyon
from here.

Desmond wraps a bandage around his right hand and grabs one
of the climbing ropes, while he simultaneously tries to
secure the soldier with his left hand.

Suddenly, there is an ear-splitting ROAR, like a freight
train approaching, moving down towards him. Desmond looks up
to see...
3.4.13 64.

A huge JAPANESE SPIGOT MORTAR SHELL, the size of a garbage
can, stuffed with twenty pounds of high explosives, arcing
down directly towards him.

Desmond looks around in terror. To jump from the cliff would
kill both him and his patient. Desmond pushes the Wounded
Soldier down and covers him with his own body...

The shell passes within six inches of Desmond and lands at
the base of the cliff - and fails to go off!

Desmond shudders with relief.

Shakily, Desmond secures the wounded Soldier, grabs the rope
with his one free hand, and using his feet to slow his
descent, jumps off the cliff and slides down the rope.

Desmond can’t control their motion very well and the rope
begins to swing, throwing them into the cliff face. Desmond
tries to put himself between the rock and the wounded
Soldier.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - BASE OF CLIFF - CONTINUOUS

Bruised and battered, Desmond reaches the bottom; terra firma
never felt so good. The Spigot Mortar Shell that missed them
is sticking out of the mud - somehow it had landed on its
back and thus failed to explode. Desmond has to steady
himself at the thought of how close he came to dying but he
has a job to do:

DESMOND (cont'd)
STRETCHER!

A FOUR MAN STRETCHER team races out from their position
hidden in the rocks and grabs the wounded soldier.

Desmond runs alongside as the Stretcher Bearers carry the
soldier back through their own lines towards the...
EXT. COMPANY AID STATION - CONTINUOUS

.+-where a DOCTOR is already treating incoming casualties.
He glances at the wounded Soldier with a critical eye.

DOCTOR
Plasma!

Desmond watches while the Doctor goes to work. He glances up
at Desmond, gesturing furiously at the soldier’s mangled
legs.
3.4.13 65.

DOCTOR (cont'd)
You ever hear of triage? He won't
last a day! And if he does, he
won’t thank you!

(to an assistant)
GET ME SOME PLASMA OVER HERE!

Desmond stumbles out of the aid station and back towards the
Escarpment. He stops in shock as he sees the rest of Company
B scrambling down off Hacksaw Ridge in a frantic, helpless
retreat. It is utter chaos.

EXT. FOXHOLE BELOW THE RIDGE - NIGHT

As Japanese mortars sporadically lay down harassment fire
Desmond crouches in his foxhole looking through his K Ration
packages for his dinner options: “Ham and Egg”, “Beef”, “Ham
and Cheese.” All meat. Resigned to going hungry, he pulls
the single hardtack cracker out of his kit and munches on it
slowly, washing it down with water from his canteen.

Smitty comes sprinting over and jumps into Desmond’s foxhole.
Desmond is surprised, but pleased at his company. For his
part, Smitty is trying to put on a good face but clearly,
he’s unnerved by their first combat experience.

DESMOND
Hey.

SMITTY
Not here to be sociable. Captain
wants all the medics to have a
rifleman with them at night, in
case one of those Jap infiltration
teams gets through. I drew the
short straw.

As Smitty talks, he nervously lays out his weapons: he jabs
his K-bar knife into the ground for quick access alongside
his pistol, his carbine, an extra magazine, and two grenades.

SMITTY (cont'd)

I couldn't see them up there! It
was like they were invisible or
something. You knew they were
there because they were tearing us
up, but you couldn’t see them.

DESMOND
Camouflage, I guess.

SMITTY
Like ghosts. You gonna eat that?
3.4.13 66.

Desmond shakes his head and Smitty snatches the Beef package,
rips it open, and stuffs it in his mouth.

SMITTY (cont'd)
Mortars are the worst. I hate the
way they sound coming in on you but
Jones told me that it’s the one you
don’t hear that kills you. I think
Grease wet himself. He wasn’t the
only one.

(slight hesitation)
Noticed you were talking to
yourself plenty, going up.

DESMOND
Praying.

SMITTY
Never been too big on church and
stuff like that.

DESMOND
Don’t need church to pray. Don’t
need anything. It’s just...you
talking to God.

SMITTY
Uh-huh. He ever talk back?

DESMOND
Not like this. More just a feeling
of being heard. Safe.

SMITTY
Safe?

Smitty looks around at the desolate landscape.

SMITTY (cont'd)
That'd be a good trick.

Smitty clearly seems to be struggling with something. After
a moment of hesitation he reaches into his pocket and hands
something to Desmond.

SMITTY (cont'd)
Here.

Desmond looks down to find the photo of Dorothy that Smitty
had stolen from him earlier in his hands. It’s torn in some
places and dirty in others, but the sight of Dorothy brings
an almost forgotten comfort to Desmond in that dark place.
3.4.13 67.

SMITTY (cont'd)
I never felt good about taking it.
And never could throw it away.

DESMOND
smitty...

SMITTY
Don’t think this means we’re square
or nothing. You’re still weird to
me. But... you did good today.

INT. COMPANY COMMAND POST - DAWN
Glover addresses the Squad Leaders and Medics.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
OK, I know we got our asses handed
to us but at least we’ve got a
better sense of what’s on top. The
Japs have built a three Bunker
system in a triangle formation
towards the southeast corner. We
neutralize those bunkers and we
should be able to roll over the
ridge.

SGT. JONES
We're too slow putting men and
supplies up there the way we did it
yesterday. Not to mention getting
our casualties down.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Yeah. I asked the Navy for some
heavy cargo nets. I figure we can
attach them to those tree stumps up
on the lip and move our men up a
heck of a lot faster. Gonna need
volunteers to tie those nets up.

There is silence. The men avoid looking at one another.
Finally, Desmond raises his hand.

DESMOND
I’1l go.

A moment, as the men take this in. Then Smitty raises his
hand, followed by Sgt. Jones.
3.4.13 68.

EXT. BASE OF THE RIDGE - DAWN

Desmond, Smitty, and Jones wait in the relative security of
the foot of the cliff. Each man ties a rope to his waist,
the end of which is secured to one end of two cargo nets
lashed together. Finished, the men pick up their climbing
ropes with the grappling hooks. They’re ready.

Glover notices a COMBAT PRESS team approaching.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
(incredulously)
What do you want?

COMBAT PHOTOGRAPHER
For the folks back home.

Glover shakes his head and nods at his three rope men.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Smile pretty for the camera,
fellas.

Desmond, Smitty and Jones force themselves to smile for the
photographer.

Glover signals and his men prop three makeshift ladders up
against the cliff face. Desmond and the two others begin to
climb as fast as they can while the ropes attached to them
are carefully played out.

The other soldiers in the unit watch in surprise and even
admiration as Desmond scoots up the ladder, all the while
mumbling a prayer. He leaves Smitty and Jones struggling
slowly behind.

Near the top, Desmond throws his grappling hook up and
secures a hold, then hoists himself, hand by hand, up over
the...

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU LIP - CONTINUOUS

Being sure to keep his head down beneath the height of the
berm, Desmond quickly removes the rope from his waist and
loops it around a thick tree stump.

Lying back on the ground, feet braced against the stump,
Desmond pulls with all his might to hoist the cargo net up
the cliff face. By this time, both Smitty and Jones are on
either side of him, pulling up their loads. From below,
Desmond can hear Glover call:
3.4.13 69.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Tie it off!

Desmond wraps the line around the tree trunk one last turn
for extra measure and then secures it with a knot. He moves
to the edge of the cliff and looks down.

He is fearless.

Below him the Photographer is clicking away. Smitty joins
Desmond, grinning and posing for the camera.

SMITTY
Like frickin’ Iwo Jima!

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Alright, ladies, get down offa
there before you get your movie
star asses shot to pieces.

EXT. COMPANY COMMAND POST - DAY

Glover lays out the refined attack plan for the squad
leaders, medics, and the Combat Press Team. On the ground in
front of him, Glover has constructed a crude diagram of the
plateau using twigs and stones.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Company A will start the assault on
the pinnacles to draw their focus
and then we head up under covering
mortar fire to keep the Japs pinned
down. Soon as we’re in position,
we pour in small arms fire while
the Demo Squad gets close enough to
toss in a satchel charge on the
main bunker. Bunker blows, we move
in fast on the other two, just like
we trained it. Questions? All
right, lets--

Tex raises his hand.
TEX
Sir... I'd like Doss to pray for us
before we go up.

Glover is stunned, but no more surprised then Desmond.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
“Pray for us?”
3.4.13 70.

TEX
The Company.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
You gotta problem with that, Doss?

DESMOND
(uncomfortable)
No, sir.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Well - I guess it can’t hurt.

EXT. BASE OF THE RIDGE - DAY

Beneath the overhang, every man in Company B has assembled
for the assault. Above them, Army mortars are continuously
blasting the top of the ridge.

Titles: Second Assault on Hacksaw Ridge.

Glover gestures unenthusiastically to Desmond who removes his
helmet and kneels, as do Tex and some of the other men.
Smitty hangs back but he watches everything closely.

Desmond himself is nervous; this is not something he wants to
do, or is comfortable with.

DESMOND
Lord. We pray - that you give our
officers here, especially Captain
Glover, wisdom in knowing how to
give his orders because our lives
are in his charge. Give us wisdom
and the...the help we need in
taking all the precautions we can,
and if it be Your Will, we all come
back alive. Amen.

Desmond looks around. To his surprise, all the men seem
focused in their prayers. Several of them echo his “Amen”
with unusual conviction. Glover looks around at his Company
and nods. For better or worse - it’s time.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
OK. Let's go.

The men of Company B begin rapidly climbing up the cargo nets
and scale the cliff. Reaching...
3.4.13 71.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU LIP - DAY

Careful to stay below the berm, they crawl on their hands and
knees and spread out along the edge of the cliff in good
order.

Desmond watches as Captain Glover quietly signals over the
radio to the mortar teams below. Almost immediately, the
Mortar barrage stops.

That’s the signal for Company B to attack. As one, the men
throw grenades over the berm and then rise up and begin a
concentrated FIRE across the plateau.

Smitty focuses his BAR on the MAIN BUNKER while...

The DEMO MAN crawls out onto the plateau, beneath the bullets
of his own men, carrying a twenty pound satchel charge of
dynamite. When he is within ten feet of the Main Bunker, he
pulls the fuse and throws his satchel on top of the bunker.

There is a tremendous EXPLOSION, blowing a hole in the Bunker
roof.

As the men are waiting for the dust to clear--

A SNIPER SHOT hits Schecter in the leg. He yells once and
falls. Immediately, Desmond kneels beside him.

SCHECTER
Oh, man, that hurts! How bad?

Desmond looks down at Irv’s leg and sees a severe, but
survivable entrance wound. The exit wound, however, is much
worse.

DESMOND
Million dollar wound, Irv. You're
going home.

Desmond starts to give Schecter a morphine injection.

SCHECTER
No--No morphine. I’m good! Save
it for somebody who needs it.

Desmond hesitates a moment, considering how tightly to wrap
the tourniquet. He glances at the wound once more and wraps
a loose tourniquet around Schecter’s leg as a Stretcher Team
hurries up alongside. They pick up Schecter and carry him
off; Schecter gives Desmond the thumbs up as he goes.
3.4.13 72.

Glover gestures and then leads a charge of the entire
Company, yelling and screaming... Desmond hurries after his
Company as they race--

ACROSS THE PLATEAU
...towards the now vulnerable bunker.

Several men toss grenades into the hole. Within the bunker,
explosions shudder the ground in rapid succession. SCREAMS
echo up from inside.

A soldier releases a searing blast of LIQUID FIRE from his
flame-thrower into the Bunker’s gun port and the screams
inside intensify.

Having demolished the Main Bunker, the Company splits into
TWO PRE-ASSIGNED TEAMS and each team attacks one of the two
remaining bunkers with grenades, satchel charges, and
flamethrowers. The Company sweeps the Ridge - victorious.

EXT. BASE OF THE RIDGE - DAY

Desmond climbs down the cargo net to find a group of his
fellow soldiers waiting for him. The men smile at him and
pat and touch his shoulder affectionately.

SOLDIERS
Heya, Doss!/Thanks, buddy!/ Way to
pray./Bless you, man./You saved us!

Desmond smiles tightly and nods--uncomfortable with their
praise.

INT. MEDIC STATION - AFTERNOON

The usual chaos as overworked doctors and nurses tend to the
newly wounded. Desmond glances around and grabs a passing
surgeon.

DESMOND
What happened to Schecter--medic in
company B? He came in just as we
started the assault.

The Surgeon looks at Desmond and shakes his head.
DESMOND (cont'd)

(stunned)
He wasn’t hurt that bad!
3.4.13 73.

SURGEON
The tourniquet must’ve come loose,
he was bleeding profusely, went
into shock. At least you gave him
morphine.

Desmond's face drains.

DESMOND
He didn’t want any.

The surgeon moves on, hurried. Desmond is devastated, guilt-
ridden for letting his friend die in pain.

INT. COMPANY B COMMAND POST - EVENING

Captain Glover is on the radio with his superior officer,
Lt. Colonel Cooney, at First Battalion HQ.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Company B accomplished its
objective today and we have secured
a foothold on the plateau.

INTERCUT AS NECESSARY--

INT. FIRST BATTALION HQ - LT. COONEY’S TENT - EVENING

LT. COONEY, an overweight but powerful man sits uncomfortably
in his tent, a map engulfing the table in front of him. As
he hears this news, he relaxes slightly.

LT. COLONEL COONEY
(surprised)
Well done, Captain. Casualties?

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Just one, sir.

LT. COLONEL COONEY
Repeat please.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
We had one casualty, sir.

LT. COLONEL COONEY
Company A on your left was
decimated and you had only one
casualty? Are you sure you
attacked the right ridge?
3.4.13

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Yes, sir.

LT. COLONEL COONEY

Well, what the heck did you boys do
differently out there today?

EXT. DOSS/SMITTY FOXHOLE, THE PLATEAU - NIGHT

74.

Desmond and Smitty are carefully heating a cup of coffee over

the flame of their burning K-ration wrappers. Smitty is

starting to relax around Desmond.

SMITTY
So what’s next? I’ve got a canteen
of water here you could turn to
wine if you want.

DESMOND
It wasn’t me; I didn’t do anything.

SMITTY
Yeah. It was God or whatever, but
you prayed him down.

DESMOND
He’s not a-- a faucet you turn off
and on. He doesn’t come running
when I whistle, it doesn’t work
that way.

SMITTY
You know what? You’re a real pain
in the ass! You’re all Holy Joe
when we're stomping you but then
when we’re on your side that
doesn’t make you feel good either!

DESMOND
(very quietly)
Irv died.
SMITTY

Schecter? What happened?

DESMOND
I screwed up.
3.4.13 75.

EXT. BEHIND THE COMMAND POST - NIGHT

Engineers are cutting SHEETS OF TIN with metal snips and
bending them around empty artillery shells to make long U-
SHAPED SECTIONS. Other Engineers connect the sections into
six-foot-long units using a hand punch and metal brads for
fasteners. There’s something medieval about the image, like
blacksmiths preparing strange Gothic siege equipment.

INT. COMPANY COMMAND POST - SAME

Captain Glover’s primitive map diagram reflects the day’s
success and tomorrow’s objective.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Every man should take pride in what
we did today. Company B achieved
something that no other unit in the
381st or the 307th has managed in
the last four weeks.

There are murmurs of satisfaction among the men. Some
whistle quietly, or nudge each other in approval. Only
Desmond is quiet.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
It looks like we broke the back of
Hacksaw’s defensive line. However,
Chief noticed a cave opening hidden
behind those three pillboxes.
There’s some speculation that this
may lead to the heart of the
Japanese fortifications.

SGT. JONES
It’s too big for satchel charges.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Exactly. So I’ve got Engineering
building us a metal trough we can
carry up in sections and assemble
on top. I figure we poke the end
of the trough into that cave and
pour a dozen Jerry cans of gasoline
and diesel fuel down their throats--
and then throw in a phosphorus
grenade or two.

SGT. JONES
Fry the sumbitches.

The men nod, spoiling for revenge.
3.4.13 76.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Any luck, we'll be done with
Hacksaw Ridge by tomorrow afternoon
and headed to the coast.

EXT. THE PLATEAU - DESMOND & SMITTY’S FOXHOLE - NIGHT

Both men are crouched in their foxhole, waiting for first
light. Desmond whispers...

DESMOND
You hear something?

Smitty shakes his head but he lifts his gun. Both men lean
forward but the darkness is impenetrable.

SMITTY
May be just a rat.

There is another SOUND now, clear to both men, off to their
left. Smitty slides a round into the chamber of his rifle.
Suddenly, they are swarmed by JAPANESE SOLDIERS! Smitty
shoots one but the second soldier bayonets him in the gut.

Desmond ducks a savage thrust from a third soldier and
clobbers him in the side of the head with his metal helmet.

Desmond tries to get to Smitty but another soldier steps
between them and fires his gun so close that the heat of the
blast scorches the side of Desmond's face. Desmond grabs the
barrel and pulls the Jap soldier forward, swinging his elbow
wildly into the man’s face and shattering his nose.

Desmond gets hit in the back and knocked to the ground. His
fingers search blindly for any kind of weapon and he finds a
broken rifle in the mud. He staggers to his feet, swinging
the rifle like a bat but a JAPANESE OFFICER steps forward,
pistol extended, pointed at Desmond’s heart.

Without thinking, Desmond raises his rifle but a FLARE goes

off overhead, bathing the battlefield in a eerie green light
and in that split-second Desmond realizes that the Japanese

Officer looks weirdly familiar...

He looks like - no, he is - Desmond’s Father! Tom Doss smiles
at Desmond as he pulls the trigger and the bullet tears into
Desmond’s chest and...

SMASH CUT TO:
3.4.13 77.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU FOXHOLE - NIGHT

Desmond wakes up in a cold sweat; his heart pounding. He is
back in his foxhole on top of the Ridge at night. Smitty
sits across from him, smoking a cigarette and carefully
cupping the burning ember so as not to give away their
position. Desmond breathes deeply. Shudders.

SMITTY
Hell of a dream.

Desmond nods. Drinks some water from his canteen. Rubs his
stiff neck. Smitty’s rifle is propped up within easy reach
and Desmond finds he can’t take his eyes off it. Smitty
notices; picks the rifle up.

SMITTY (cont'd)
It won’t bite, you know.

DESMOND
Yes, it will.

Desmond takes a breath.

DESMOND (cont'd)
My dad was a drunk. He fought it
for years but it got ahold of him
hard. Made him mean.

Desmond pauses. And Smitty knows he’s hearing a raw story.

SMITTY
How mean?

DESMOND
He use to beat me and my brother
just because the sun rose and about
as often. I could take that. But
when he laid his hand on my
momma...

FADE TO:

EXT. DOSS HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - EVENING

Bertha sits on the front step, SOBBING, one hand to her
bloodied face. Eight year old Desmond huddles beside her,
protectively, one arm around her shoulder.

In the yard, Tom argues violently with Bertha’s brother,
UNCLE ARTHUR. Both men are drunk and angry.
3.4.13 78.

TOM
Get your damn nose out of my
business! You hear me?

ARTHUR
Touch my sister again, and see what
happens.

TOM

GET OUTTA HERE!

Tom swings at Arthur, catching him off-guard, but Arthur
comes roaring back with a flurry of punches which drive Tom
stumbling backwards. Tom trips and falls.

Arthur kicks at him but Tom grabs Arthur’s foot and brings
the bigger man down. They roll over and over across the
yard, punching and gouging.

Tom staggers to his feet and pulls a PISTOL out of his jacket
pocket! Bertha leaps up.

BERTHA
TOM! DON’T!

With no thought for her own safety, Bertha throws herself
between the two men.

Desmond watches from the porch, an eight-year-old boy, frozen
with fear.

DESMOND
Momma !

Tom’s hand is shaking but he continues to hold the gun out in
front of him - now pointed directly at Bertha. She moves
towards Tom, her eyes never leaving his face.

BERTHA
Give me that gun, Tom. Please.
Give it here, before somebody gets
hurt.

Tom hesitates. In the distance, there is the SOUND of an
approaching Police Siren.

BERTHA (cont'd)
You kill him, and they’1l hang you
for sure. You know they will.

Tom’s courage deserts him and he hands the gun over to
Bertha.
3.4.13 79.

BERTHA (cont'd)
Desmond! You take this and get rid
of it somewhere. Throw it in the
river!

Desmond runs over and takes the gun from Bertha.
BERTHA (cont'd)
Go on, now! Hurry before the
police get here!

Desmond takes off running.

EXT. PLATEAU FOXHOLE - RETURN TO PRESENT

SMITTY
You throw it away?

This is very hard for Desmond; he’s never told anybody this
before. Ever.

DESMOND
That’s what I told my momma.

SMITTY
What’d you really do?

DESMOND
Hid it. In the woods.

SMITTY
How come?

EXT. DOSS HOUSE - FRONT YARD - THE PAST

Desmond returns back to the house just as the POLICE load his
handcuffed father into a police car in front of gawking
neighbors.

Bertha is weeping, hugging Tom, but he ignores her. Over her
shoulder, Tom can see Desmond, watching his father’s public
shame - and he glares maliciously at his son.

DESMOND (V.O.)
Because I was going to need it to
kill my daddy.

INT. DOSS HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Bertha stands outside the bathroom door. From inside, there
are the SOUNDS of sharp blows.
3.4.13 80.

BERTHA
Tom! Please. Stop it!

INT. DOSS HOUSE - BATHROOM - SAME

Inside the bathroom, Tom brutally whips Desmond with his
razor strop.

BERTHA (0.C.)
Tom, you’re gonna kill the boy!
TOM!

Desmond grits his teeth - he won’t give his father the
satisfaction of crying out - but he can’t stop the tears that
are running down his face.

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

Finally released, Desmond runs through the woods, the tears
drying on his fierce face, his eyes blazing.

He reaches an old gnarled Oak Tree and falls to his knees.
He digs inside a hollow in the roots and extracts a weathered
cigar box and reaches inside to pull out - his father’s gun.

Desmond examines the gun in the fading light. The weight of
it feels good in his hands. The intricacies of the mechanism
itself are appealing. And in its power to distribute
Justice, in its God-like power of life and death - it is a
beautiful thing.

INT. DOSS HOUSE - EVENING

Desmond enters his house and moves up the stairs. He stops
on the landing. From his parents’ room he can hear their
voices. Desmond pushes open the door to...

INT. DOSS HOUSE - PARENTS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

His mother sits at her vanity table, brushing her hair. Tom
paces back and forth behind Bertha, berating her.

TOM DOSS
Spare the rod and spoil the child!
Isn’t that what that church of
yours preaches?! Well that boy’s
spoiled rotten and it’s about time--

He stops when Desmond enters.
3.4.13 81.

TOM
What do you want?

Desmond raises the gun. Tom’s eyes widen in fear. The gun
wavers in Desmond’s trembling hand.

JUMP CUT TO:

EXT. PLATEAU FOXHOLE - RETURN TO PRESENT - NIGHT
Smitty leans forward in disbelief.

SMITTY
You killed him?

INT. DOSS HOUSE - PARENTS’ BEDROOM - EVENING - THE PAST

Desmond stands there pointing the gun at his father while his
mother looks on in horror.

DESMOND (V.O.)
I could’ve. God knows I wanted to.
I wanted to kill him for everything
he ever did my momma, and my
brother, and to me!

Then, although it takes everything Desmond has, he turns
around and walks away.

EXT. BY THE JAMES RIVER - NIGHT

Desmond stares at the dark waters rolling past. He throws
the gun into the river as far as he can.

DESMOND (V.O.)
But I didn’t. And that’s when I
made a promise to God I’d never
touch a gun again.

EXT. PLATEAU FOXHOLE - NIGHT - RETURN TO PRESENT

DESMOND
It isn’t because I’m more holy than
the next guy. It isn’t because I
I’m any better. Just the opposite.
3.4.13 82.

SMITTY
(quietly)
You think--looking at all the
killing everywhere around us--you
really think there’s a God that
gives a damn about us?

Desmond looks at him. Smitty is serious. Desmond nods.

SMITTY (cont'd)
That'd really be something if it
was true. Wouldn’t it?

A Japanese mortar round lands ten yards away, scattering
debris and shrapnel over both men. As other mortar shells
begin to fall, a JAPANESE HAND GRENADE lands close to them.

Smitty pushes Desmond down, grabs his B.A.R. and begins
spraying the field in front of them. Simultaneously, JAPANESE
SOLDIERS appear out of hidden spider holes and trenches not
only in front of, but within the American lines. It’s as if
they materialized out of the mud by magic.

A chaotic fire-fight breaks out all around Desmond and Smitty
as the terrified American soldiers of Company B discover that
the enemy is all around them. Cross fire from both sides
kills indiscriminately.

A Japanese Soldier bursts out of the darkness behind Smitty
and bayonets him in the back. Smitty screams. Desmond jumps
up and punches the Japanese soldier in the face, knocking him
to the ground.

The Japanese soldier pulls out a knife and Desmond launches
himself on top of the man, trying to wrestle the knife away.

The two roll over and over across the muddy ground. Desmond
manages to break the other man’s grip on the knife but the
soldier grabs Desmond by the throat and begins choking him.

Desmond is close to blacking out. He reaches out
desperately, trying to find something, anything. His hands
touch a ROCK and he manages a glancing blow on the shoulder
of the Japanese soldier. It’s enough to break his hold on
Desmond’s throat. Desmond pushes the soldier away and rolls
over on top of him.

Desmond raises the rock above his head in both hands,
prepared to bring it down on his enemy’s skull in a crushing
blow. He screams as he begins to bring the rock down but is
knocked off course by a nearby explosion.

Desmond is momentarily stunned but almost immediately picks
up the rock again and turns back to the Japanese soldier.
3.4.13 83.

He is weeping with fury and frustration. In that one brief
moment, the Japanese Soldier rolls away narrowly escaping
Desmond's blow, staggers to his feet and runs off.

Desmond crawls over to Smitty but he’s too late. Smitty is
dead.

Desmond is utterly distraught.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU - EARLY MORNING

The entire area is engulfed in flame and weapons fire. All
over the killing field, individual fights and deaths are
playing out as the sun begins to peek over the horizon,
casting a dull red glow over ground running with blood.

Among it all, we find Captain Glover and his RADIO OPERATOR.
Glover tries to assert command and save what’s left of his
rapidly collapsing company.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
FALL BACK! FALL BACK!

Glover throws a smoke grenade to try and mask his troops’
withdrawal to the cliff’s edge. His men fire frantically at
an enemy who seems to be everywhere, sometimes hitting their
own men. Glover yells at his RADIO OPERATOR.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
MORTARS ON TOP! EVERYTHING WE GOT!

As the Radio Operator picks up his headset, a Japanese Sniper
bullet catches him squarely in the forehead.

A Second American Soldier grabs the headset and is also hit.

Glover reaches for the headset and a burst of machine gun
fire destroys the equipment and sprays shrapnel in his face
and chest.

Desmond grabs Smitty’s body by the collar of his shirt and
drags him back towards the safety of the cliff, some fifty
yards away.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - CLIFF EDGE - CONTINUOUS

Despite the horror and chaos, those American Soldiers who
make it back to the cliff try to set up a perimeter behind
the berm and return fire so that the rest of their comrades
can get off of Hacksaw.
3.4.13 84.

As Desmond approaches the cliff edge, Grease frantically
waves him to drop down.

GREASE
Get down! DOWN!

Desmond glances over his shoulder to see THREE JAPANESE
SOLDIERS, bayonets fixed on their rifles, racing towards him.

Desmond sprawls on the ground and Grease fires, killing two
of the Japanese and wounding the Third Soldier - who staggers
past Desmond and STABS Grease in the gut.

Grease drops his rifle and SCREAMS. He wraps his arms around
his assailant and frantic, staggers backwards and falls...

.»..over the edge of the cliff, screaming horribly all the way
down.

Desmond drags Smitty’s body to the edge of the cliff where an
insane scramble of men are trying to get down the cargo nets,
ropes, and ladders. Soldiers drop or throw their weapons
away. Some, desperate to the point of madness, JUMP OFF the
cliff.

A burst of MACHINE GUN fire kills Rennelli, not five feet
from Desmond.

Desmond is swept up in the confusion and terror; men are
falling so fast he doesn’t know where to turn. He looks DOWN
THE CARGO NET--offerring him escape...

Desmond glances back toward the retreating Americans. Any
man who can still move on his own is running or crawling back
to the cliff. Behind them, everywhere, there are dead,
dying, and wounded American soldiers littering the plateau.

Desmond is covered in sweat, mud, and blood. Shaking with
fear and adrenalin. Escape is just a few feet away but -
this is what he is here for. He takes a deep, shuddering
breath and...

.+..Desmond heads back, onto the killing field, passing
Captain Glover and the last of the rear guard as he does so.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU - DAY

Desmond finds a Soldier with a sucking chest wound. Desmond
peels away the man’s bloody uniform blouse and applies a
battle dressing but the strength of the panicked soldier's
desperate gasps for air threaten to pull the dressing further
into the wound.
3.4.13 85.

Thinking quickly, Desmond pulls out his poncho and rips off a
square of plastic from the tail. Desmond puts the plastic
patch over the wound to seal it, and then finishes it off
with the bandage. It holds.

Desmond grabs the Soldier by the collar of his shirt and
drags him back to...

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - CLIFF EDGE - DAY

What remains of Company B’s makeshift Rear Guard is throwing
grenades as fast as they can out of open crates hand-carried
to the top.

Two STRETCHER BEARERS grab Desmond’s wounded soldier and
start down the cargo net with him. To their surprise,
Desmond doesn’t follow.

STRETCHER BEARER#1
COME ON! WE’VE BEEN ORDERED OFF!
GET OUTTA THERE!

Desmond shakes his head--no.

DESMOND
LEAVE ME YOUR DRESSINGS!

Stretcher Bearer#1 looks at Stretcher Bearer#2.

The two men tear off their first aid field packs and quickly
disappear over the edge. Desmond grabs their kits and heads
back on his hands and knees onto the field of fire.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU - DAY

The sun is at a low angle now, throwing long shadows across
the top of the plateau which is clouded with smoke and dust,
creating a surreal world of shadows in which it is impossible
to determine friend from foe until you are almost on them.

Desmond manages to creep from spot to spot, relatively
unseen.

Japanese Mortar Fire still falls erratically, along with
individual sniping. Desmond finds another Soldier moaning on
the ground, his right arm mangled. Desmond applies a
tourniquet and starts to drag the man back. As he passes
another Wounded Soldier, the man cries out and tries to
clutch his sleeve.

WOUNDED SOLDIER#2
Don’t leave me!
3.4.13 86.

Desmond hesitates. Then...

DESMOND
I’m comin’ back.

EXT. BASE OF THE RIDGE - DAY

In the relative safety of the base of the cliff, Glover, his
face and chest still covered in blood, tries to get a handle
on his situation.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
How many we got down?!?

SGT. JONES
Must’a left nearly seventy-five men
up there!

Glover shakes his head. This is a disaster.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - CLIFF EDGE - DAY

Desmond drags the wounded Soldier back to the lip. He looks
over the edge. If he climbs down with each casualty it will
take twice as long, he’ll exhaust himself quickly, and other
men will die who might have been saved.

Making a quick decision, Desmond grabs one of the ropes
hanging over the cliff edge and pulls it up. He doubles the
rope and ties a bowline in it - just like he did that day in
basic training--a secure knot with TWO LOOPS.

Desmond secures the wounded man’s legs, one into each loop,
wraps the remaining rope around the man’s chest twice and
then, bracing himself against a rock, slowly lowers the man
down to...

EXT. BASE OF THE RIDGE - DAY

...where the two stretcher bearers are huddled on the ground
in exhaustion, sucking down water. To their astonishment,
they glance up to see the wounded soldier being lowered
towards them.

They spring into action, catching the wounded soldier by the
legs and gently laying him down on the ground.

STRETCHER BEARER#1
STRETCHER!
3.4.13 87.

The two men hurriedly unhook the wounded soldier and the rope
disappears back up the cliff.

Two additional Stretcher Bearers come running up with a
litter. Behind them is Captain Glover.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
What the hell is going on!?!?

STRETCHER BEARER#1
Some nut up there is dragging
wounded off the top.

STRETCHER BEARER#2
It’s that medic--Doss.

Glover glances up through the smoke and the dust...to see yet
another casualty being lowered down. Just for a moment he
glimpses Desmond’s face over the edge of the cliff.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Doss?! What are you doing?! Get
your ass down from there!

Desmond ignores him and disappears back over the edge.
Glover looks around, trying to figure out how to play this.
He gestures to a Second Radio Operator.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
DON'T JUST STAND THERE. CALL THE
MORTARS! TELL THEM TO CEASE FIRE!
IMMEDIATELY!

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU - DAY

Desmond spots THREE WOUNDED AMERICAN SOLDIERS lying in the
lee of a small group of rocks which are barely keeping them
alive, covered as they are by overlapping lines of fire from
multiple Japanese positions.

Desmond crawls towards the soldiers, trying to use a shallow
depression in the terrain to get close, but a BURST of fire
from a Japanese machine gun pins him down.

Desmond tries to catch his breath, wipe the sweat out of his
eyes, and regain his courage.

He moves again towards the soldiers, and again a burst of
machine gun explodes around him, even closer now, shattering
the tip of the stones which barely cover him, and cutting him
with razor-sharp shards of shattered limestone.
3.4.13 88.

Desmond is momentarily paralyzed with fear. He knows if he
waits any longer, he will lose what little courage he has
left. He carefully reaches behind and yanks out his tattered
poncho.

Desmond rolls over on his back and waves his poncho over the
top of the rocks, drawing a characteristic 6-8 round burst of
fire from the Jap machine gun. Then he hears it stop--

THE JAPANESE MACHINE GUNNERS must stop firing and reload.

As they reload, Desmond jumps to his feet and sprints around
the side of the rocks, grabs one of the wounded soldiers, and
drags him quickly towards the cliff’s edge.

INT. FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY

A new wave of wounded soldiers are suddenly being carried in
by stretcher teams. As the HEAD DOCTOR begins his
examination of the first man - the soldier with the sucking
chest wound - he glances over at the stretcher team who
brought him in.

HEAD DOCTOR
Where these guys coming from?

STRETCHER BEARER#1
There’s a medic still on top.

HEAD DOCTOR
On Hacksaw?

STRETCHER BEARER#2
Won’t come down.

The Head Doctor and his Nurse look at one another in
disbelief.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU - DAY

Desmond crawls on his hands and knees to a new position
behind a small limestone outcropping. Sprawled on the ground
beside him are the bodies of four dead Japanese soldiers,
killed by a mortar blast.

Desmond is only fifteen yards away from the remaining two
wounded American soldiers but they are still closely covered
by two Japanese machine guns.
3.4.13 89.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - BEHIND JAPANESE LINES - SAME

A member of one of the machine gun units spots Desmond and
excitedly waves to his partner who rachets back the return on
his weapon and sprays Desmond's position with a quick burst.

Desmond hugs the ground with everything he has. The bullets
whistle over his head, inches away.

INT. CAVE WITHIN PLATEAU - SAME

Simultaneously, from inside one of the Japanese underground
firing positions hand carved out of the limestone, a JAPANESE
SNIPER also glimpses Desmond. He carefully slides into
position, his rifle poking out of a six inch wide gun port.

The magnified cross-hairs of his sniper scope slide over the
rocks until they settle on Desmond's head. Desmond ducks
down.

The sniper takes a breath. Only a matter of time before
Desmond raises his head again.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU - SAME

Desmond, still focused on the machine gun position (and
oblivious to the sniper now stalking him) racks his brains,
trying to think of a way to get to the two wounded men.

He glances at one of the dead Japanese soldiers beside him
and an idea forms. Desmond takes off his helmet and rips off
the tape hiding the Red Cross symbol. He straps his helmet
on the dead Japanese Soldier and then very carefully pushes
the dead man forward so that his head and trunk appear above
the rock outcropping.

A single shot rings out - the sniper strikes Desmond’s helmet
dead center. Desmond hadn’t expected that - the sniper - but
he has the presence of mind to fling the dead soldier out
from behind the rocks, to the side away from his American
wounded. Both Jap machine gun emplacements rake the corpse.

Simultaneously, Desmond rolls out the other side, rises to
his feet and sprints like crazy while the machine gun teams
reload. Desmond swoops down, grabs the second American
soldier by the collar, and drags him off.
3.4.13 90.

INT. CAVE WITHIN PLATEAU - SAME

The SNIPER realizes he’s been tricked but by the time he can
put another round into the chamber and get his sights on
Desmond, the American has disappeared. The Sniper curses a
blue streak in Japanese, and then moves to find a better
vantage point.

The Sniper half runs, half crawls, through a SERIES OF
TUNNELS until he reaches...

INT. ANOTHER GUN PORT - CAVE WITHIN PLATEAU - CONTINUOUS

A dead Japanese Soldier lies slumped against the port. The
Sniper shoves him to the floor and takes his place, rifle at
the ready...

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU - SAME

Desmond moves as fast as he can, darting from rock to rock,
dragging his wounded soldier behind him. He’s only ten yards
away from the edge of the cliff.

INT. GUN PORT - CAVE WITHIN PLATEAU - SAME

The Sniper smiles as Desmond comes right into his sights. He
slowly squeezes the trigger and - the gun jams! Furious, he
works the rifle bolt to eject the offending shell but when he
peeks again through the hole...Desmond is gone again.

EXT. BASE OF THE RIDGE - COMPANY B CAMP - SAME

What’s left of Company B has fallen back to a position of
relative safety behind the Command Post. The men are ina
state of shock. Some, like Tex and Hollywood, just sit and
stare into space, lit cigarettes dangling uselessly from
their trembling fingers. Others weep shamelessly. Chief runs
up and crouches down beside Tex and Hollywood.

CHIEF DRUCKER
(quietly)
Desmond is still up there.

TEX
Doss?

Hollwood’s ears perk up.

HOLLYWOOD
Wait. On Hacksaw?
3.4.13 91.

Chief nods. The three men look at one another. They rise
stiffly to their feet and head back towards Hacksaw Ridge.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU - DAY

Desmond has returned to get the third soldier. He's
deliberately approached him from yet another direction but
even from here, the wounded man is still well covered by the
two Japanese machine gun emplacements.

Desmond inches his way through a field of American and
Japanese corpses when one of the Japanese dead moans.

Desmond stops and glances over at the Japanese soldier. The
man has been shot in the shoulder but he’s not bleeding
badly. Left alone, he will surely die but if bandaged, he
might survive. Desmond hesitates - then begins to crawl away
towards his intended goal, the wounded American.

The Japanese soldier moans again. Desmond stops. He can’t
let him die. Desmond moves back alongside the Japanese
soldier and begins to dress his shoulder wound.

INT. TUNNEL - SAME

The Japanese Sniper moves from one shooting port to the next,
searching for Desmond. He stops. Smiles. He puts his gun
up to the port and wipes the sweat off his face and then
screws his eye to the sniper scope.

POV SNIPER SCOPE

The cross-hairs move across the landscape...and find Desmond.
The cross-hairs start up toward Desmond’s forehead, but
something he glimpsed confuses the sniper; he moves the
crosshairs down to the wounded soldier Desmond is tending
and his Japanese insignia comes into clear focus.

The sniper recoils in astonishment. For a moment, he is
bewildered. He puts his eye back to the scope.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU - SAME

Desmond wipes the Japanese soldier’s bullet wound with
alcohol and sprinkles sulfa powder over it; he knows he’s
exposed here and he’s working as quickly as he can. Every
second could be his last.
3.4.13 92.

INT. TUNNEL - SAME

The sniper lifts his eye from the scope again; what Desmond
is doing has caused him to scan across the whole field of
ruptured bodies, both Japanese and American. But he’s a
soldier, and whispers to himself--

SNIPER
(in Japanese)
What are you waiting for?!

He takes a breath, lowers his eye to his scope, and takes
careful aim.

SERIES OF SHOTS:

--He lines the cross-hairs up on Desmond's head.

--Close on sniper’s finger curling slowly around the trigger.
--Close on sniper’s mouth as he gently exhales

--He squeezes the trigger.

--Through the scope, he sees Desmond taping the final bandage
in place when a mortar shell lands between Desmond and the
Sniper!

The debris shatters the Sniper’s scope and blinds him. He
staggers back from the port, blood pouring down his face.
Another mortar shell lands even closer and the tunnel shakes.
The Sniper turns to run and a third mortar shell falls
directly on his position and as he screams, the tunnel
disintegrates around him, burying him alive.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU - SAME

Desmond is oblivious to the fate of the sniper as mortar
shells are now falling thick and fast all over the plateau.
Knowing that any Japanese in the area are as much at risk
from these random rounds as he is, Desmond makes a calculated
decision to go for it. He rises to his feet and sprints to
the third wounded American.

Desmond reaches him and pulls him up to his feet, drapes the
man’s left arm around his own neck, and begins to stagger/run
towards the ridge.
3.4.13 93.

EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY

Desmond has roped up the third man and just lowered him down
to safety. Desmond crouches there on his hands and knees,
shaking with exhaustion.

Behind him, in the distance, he hears another American voice
calling for help. Desmond closes his eyes.

DESMOND
(quietly)
Just one more. Please.

MONTAGE

A SERIES OF SHOTS as the sun moves overhead across the sky,
and Desmond moves across the plateau, saving one life at a
time, dragging/carrying each soldier to the edge of the
cliff, roping him up and lowering him down to safety.

DESMOND (V.O.)
Let me get one more...

FADE TO:

EXT. BASE OF THE RIDGE - TWILIGHT

Glover, Hollywood, Chief, Tex and dozens of soldiers from
other companies watch silently as Desmond lowers one last man
down from Hacksaw Ridge...but this one is already dead...

We see this last man’s face...it’s Smitty. As the body
slowly descends, we realize Desmond’s last act was to
retrieve Smitty’s body.

And with that, Desmond finally leaves Hacksaw Ridge. Slowly,
painfully, he climbs down the rope alone.

When Desmond reaches the bottom, he fights not to collapse
into the arms of the men waiting at the base of the cliff.
His uniform is completely soaked with blood and mud, and
flies swarm around him but he’s too tired to bat them away
with his torn and bleeding hands. The men stare at him like
he’s a ghost as Desmond glances down at his uniform,
straining to move his head to look up again.

Captain Glover is one of them.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Is he wounded?
3.4.13 94,

TEX
He’s not shot.

DESMOND

(barely audible)

Sorry.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
For what?

DESMOND
I think...

CAPTAIN GLOVER
They’re all down, Desmond. You
got’em all.
(to the others)
Go him to the aid station.

INT. AID STATION - TWILIGHT

Everyone has heard about Desmond’s heroics. The surgeons,
stretcher teams, and nurses all watch silently as Desmond
changes his bloody uniform for a replacement uniform - a
washed and bleached uniform of a dead soldier.

Carefully, he removes his pocket Bible, taking a moment to
try and wipe off the blood that stains its front cover.
Something on the blouse he’s about to put on catches his eye.
The lettering is faded but it looks like..."Schecter."”

For just a moment, everything swims in front of his eyes.

EXT. DESMOND’S FOXHOLE, BELOW THE RIDGE - NIGHT

Raining. Along with the usual sporadic Japanese mortar fire.
Desmond sits - alone - in the dugout he once shared with
Smitty. Tex scurries up out of the dark. He puts a can of K-
rations down in front of Desmond.

DESMOND
What’s this?

JOSH “TEX” ROYAL
(quietly)
Peaches. Never liked’em all that
much.

Tex leaves. A moment later, Hollywood comes over and sets
down another rare can of non-meat K rations.
3.4.13 95.

HOLLYWOOD
Here. I’m full.

From all over, Company B survivors come up to Desmond, one by
one, and silently lay cans of non-meat food in front of him
and then disappear into the dark. Desmond stares at the pile
of food.

FADE TO:

INT. COMPANY COMMAND POST - SAME

It is a very subdued meeting of a much reduced leadership
team. The men are exhausted; completely worn out mentally
and physically.

CAPTAIN GLOVER

(barely audible)
Okay.

(louder)
Okay. Word is...word from HQ is,
we gotta go back up on Hacksaw
tomorrow. And we gotta take it,
this time.

The men are silent, close to mutiny. In the rear, someone
groans.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
I know, I know. Look, they know
what we're up against and they’ve
promised us a full company of
reinforcements, and a massive
bombardment preceding the assault,
including naval guns and aircraft.
The heart of their defensive line
is that cave towards the rear of
the escarpment. We get to that,
take out that cave, and Hacksaw is
ours.

The men look at one another, reaching some unspoken
agreement, and then stare back to Sergeant Jones.

SGT. JONES
Sir? The only way Company B goes
back up on that Ridge tomorrow is
if Desmond Doss goes with us.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
(confused)
Any reason to think he won't?
3.4.13 96.

SGT. JONES
Well - it’s Saturday.

EXT. OKINAWAN TOMB - DAWN

Desmond sits behind the shelter of a stone Okinawan tomb,
reading his Bible when to his surprise Captain Glover
appears. Glover squats down beside Desmond; looks out over
the countryside as the first sliver of sunlight illuminates
the landscape.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Sometimes, if I squint a little
bit, this countryside reminds me a
little bit of South Carolina. A
South Carolina that’s been bombed
and blown to a jillion little muddy
pieces but still...

Desmond nods.

DESMOND
You catch a whiff of pine
sometimes, almost makes me
homesick.

CAPTAIN GLOVER

We’re gonna have to go back up on
Hacksaw tomorrow. And tomorrow is
your Sabbath.

(beat)
Most of the men don’t believe in
the same way you do. But they
believe so much... in how much you
believe... that they won’t go up
that Ridge unless you’re with them,
completely.

Desmond looks back at the Captain, not sure he understands
what Glover is asking.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
It’s not their Sabbath, it’s yours.
And they figure that for this
assault to be square with God, it’s
gotta be square with you.

Desmond puts down his Bible and studies Glover.
DESMOND

Sir, if you could give me...just a
few minutes.
3.4.13 97.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - DAY

Explosion after explosion tears into the Ridge from a variety
of American guns: mortars, howitzers, off-shore Naval
batteries and Army rockets. Marine F4U Corsairs bomb and
strafe the rugged terrain. Occasionally, a secondary
explosion indicates some lucky round has found its mark - an
ammunition or fuel dump.

Titles: Hacksaw Ridge. Third Assault.

Smoke, dust, and debris rise into the air in a dark cloud lit
with flame as if the Ridge were an erupting volcano.

EXT. ASSEMBLY POINT BENEATH THE CLIFF - SAME

The men of Company B - resigned veterans and nervous
replacements - wait in their pre-assault positions. But
their focus is not on the Ridge. They are all looking
backwards, toward the rear of the line.

INT. COMPANY COMMAND POST - SAME

Glover smokes a last cigarette while he gets an earful from
HQ over the Company field telephone.

INTERCUT AS NECESSARY--

INT. FIRST BATTALION HQ - LT. COONEY’S OFFICE - DAY

LT. COLONEL COONEY (ON PHONE)
What the hell is your delay,
Captain?! You were supposed to
begin that assault ten minutes ago!
The entire 307th Infantry and the
whole 7th Fleet is cooling its
heels for you!

CAPTAIN GLOVER
We're waiting, sir.

LT. COLONEL COONEY
Waiting for what?!

Captain Glover glances towards the rear of the line where in
the distance, a long figure kneels.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
We're waiting for Private Doss to
finish praying.
3.4.13 98.

EXT. ASSEMBLY POINT BENEATH THE CLIFF - SAME

On his knees, Dorothy’s Bible in his hands. The strain and
horror of the last ten days is etched in his face.
Haltingly, Desmond tries to work this out with his God.

DESMOND

(quietly)
I’ve done my best to...to be
faithful to you, and the promises I
made. I gotta...break one of those
promises now and I’m asking your
forgiveness. It may be a wrong
thing but I can’t let my men go up
there alone. And if that is a sin
then I take it on my heart, alone.
Amen.

Chief nudges Hollywood and points to where Desmond Doss is
walking towards them.

INT. COMPANY B COMMAND POST - SAME
Captain Glover sees Desmond coming, rejoining the line.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
(into field telephone)
Company B is ready to go, sir.

EXT. ASSEMBLY POINT BENEATH THE CLIFF - MOMENTS LATER

Above them, the bombardment suddenly stops. The SILENCE is
deafening. Every man left in Company B - including Desmond -—
is ready. On their faces, each and every one, is a fierce
look of quiet determination.

Captain Glover looks to Desmond. Desmond nods.

DESMOND
(quietly)
Let's go.

Glover leads his men climbing up the cargo nets. Desmond
follows behind.

BELOW THE LIP OF THE PLATEAU

Glover and his group leaders hang for a moment on the cargo
nets as they pull grenades out of their pockets. They yank
the pins and lob the grenades over their heads onto the
plateau.
3.4.13 99.

As soon as the grenades begin exploding, Glover and the men
are climbing as fast as they can.

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - PLATEAU LIP - CONTINUOUS

Glover leads his men in a wild charge up and over the edge of
the cliff and onto....

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - THE PLATEAU - CONTINUOUS

The men of Company B quickly sweep past the stunned Japanese
positions and overwhelm the few defenders unlucky enough to
be caught above ground. The Americans push on towards the
southern edge of the plateau and...

THE BIG CAVE OPENING

The ASSAULT TEAMS move with grim efficiency. Riflemen throw
smoke grenades, shielding their work from the Japanese mortar
squads on the southern hills.

BAR Squads keep the defenders pinned down within the cave
complex entrance...

EXPLOSIVE TEAMS inch forward under fire to throw their
satchel charges inside.

As soon as the explosions erupt, Glover sends in the FLAME-
THROWER TEAMS who douse the opening with long searing plumes
of fire.

Following them, Chief, Tex, and Hollywood run up with opened
JERRY CANS OF GASOLINE, one after another, which they throw
into the mouth of the cave and the shaft below.

Glover edges close to the entrance and throws in two
phosphorus grenades igniting an ENORMOUS EXPLOSION that can
only mean that somewhere inside, a major ammo dump has caught
fire.

Suddenly, the entire ridge SHAKES like an earthquake.
SMOKE billows out, not just through the cave entrance but
through dozens and dozens of different SNIPER HOLES and
cunningly hidden ASSAULT ENTRANCES scattered all over.

Tasting blood, Company B sweeps past the Big Cave entrance
SCREAMING with battle lust and moves down...
3.4.13 100.

THE REVERSE SLOPE

A tide of lethal efficiency sweeping everything before it.
Hacksaw Ridge is finally falling.

EXT. THE REVERSE SLOPE - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

Desmond follows Tex, Chief, and Hollywood as they continue to
secure the southern flank of the Ridge.

Suddenly, to their left, a JAPANESE SOLDIER rises from his
spider hole, pistol in one hand and grenade in the other. He
empties his pistol wildly but all three men get rounds off in
reply, dropping the Japanese Soldier to his knees with shots
to the chest and head but...

...-As he collapses, he throws the HAND GRENADE.
The hand grenade comes arcing towards the Americans.

Desmond PUSHES his fellow soldiers out of the way but there’s
no escape for himself.

The grenade lands directly in front of Desmond. He throws
himself backwards and simultaneously tries to kick the
grenade away...

The grenade EXPLODES with a shower of dirt, rocks, and blood!
Desmond SCREAMS with pain. He looks down at his leg - it’s
ragged and covered with blood. Desmond rolls over onto his
back.

HOLLYWOOD
THEY GOT DESMOND!

Bright arterial blood is beginning to spurt from Desmond's
torn femoral artery. Chief squats down beside him and places
both his big hands on the wound and presses down hard.

Simultaneously, Tex is pulling battlefield dressings out of
Desmond’s kit with shaky hands and handing them to Chief.

CHIEF DRUCKER
MEDIC!

Captain Glover comes running up and when he sees who the
wounded man is, his face blanches.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Keep pressure on!

TEX
HE’S DYING!
3.4.13 101.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
The hell he is! WE GOTTA GET HIM
BACK!

The men gather around and pick up Desmond. [THE SAME SCENE
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM]

The men half run, half stumble across the still smoking
battlefield, Desmond cradled in their arms, until they reach
the...

EXT. HACKSAW RIDGE - CLIFF EDGE - CONTINUOUS

The men don’t hesitate. Carrying their wounded friend, they
scramble down the nets and jury-rigged ladders, their
constant attention only on Desmond...

EXT. BASE OF THE RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Glover directs the men to carry Desmond to a waiting field
ambulance. The TWO MEDICS there hastily load Desmond into
the truck and begin prepping him for an IV. Glover leans
over Desmond; Tex, Chief and Hollywood press close,
anxiously.

Desmond looks like hell. The color is completely drained out
of his face and he’s beginning to shake. Glover holds his
hand. One of the Medics injects Desmond with morphine.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
(quietly)
You're going home, Desmond. See
that pretty bride of yours.

Desmond tries to talk. Can’t. Chokes. Shakily he pats his
shirt pocket.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
What?

DESMOND
(almost inaudible)
.-+-my bible.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
You can get another copy when you
get home. Hear it’s a popular
book.

Desmond tries to speak and coughs again, a violent shuddering
cough, and a bright clot of blood appears in the corner of
his mouth. Glover glances over at one of the Medics...
3.4.13 102.

...the Medic shakes his head; this guy is not going to make
it.

Glover clutches Desmond’s hand one more time.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
Hang in there, Desmond.

Glover steps away as the ambulance drives off.

Exhausted, Glover squats on the ground to steady himself.
Around him, Tex, Chief, Hollywood, and the others collapse
into the mud.

Glover shakes his head; wipes the sweat and the mud out of
his eyes; some decision slowly working its way out. He rises
stiffly but with great determination, and begins re-arming
himself from the stack of supplies and ammunition at the base
of the cliff.

As it dawns on the men what Glover intends to do, Tex, Chief,
and Hollywood also rise and begin to arm themselves as well.
Glover glances at them.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
(quietly)
You don’t have to... Every Jap
still up there will die before he
surrenders.

The men nod. They all turn and look back up at the cliff.
The plateau above is lit up again by artillery and mortar
fire. Then, unbelievably, they begin to climb back up
Hacksaw Ridge.

FADE TO:

INT. ARMY FIELD HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Desmond wakes. He tries to sit up but discovers his right
arm and left leg are in a cast and the entire right side of
his body is covered with bandages. The pain and medications
leave him feeling woozy and disoriented. He looks around.

POV DESMOND - DISTORTED
A MAN in unbelievably filthy fatigues is standing beside the

bed, looking at him. Desmond manages to get his eyes to
FOCUS and the man gradually swims into view - Captain Glover.
3.4.13 103.

CAPTAIN GLOVER
Doctors say you had enough shrapnel
in you to build your own short wave
radio. But you’re gonna be
alright.

Desmond manages a smile.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
Just so you know, I put you up for
a sack of medals for what you did
up on Hacksaw, so if some General
with a chest-full of fruit salad
comes through and pins one on you,
you can blame me.

Glover pauses and a smile creeps onto his face.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)
Also, I have something of yours.

Glover reaches into his jacket and retrieves Desmond’s beat-—
up, water stained POCKET BIBLE.

CAPTAIN GLOVER (cont’d)

When the men heard you were missing

this, they all volunteered to go

look for it. Kind of beat up but -

they wanted you to know, they were

thinking of you.
Desmond takes the Bible and runs his hands over it. As
Glover turns and walks away, Desmond notices a soldier (the
soldier Desmond saved) sitting up in bed smiling with two
stumps where his legs used to be.

Desmond smiles back as the soldier lifts his water glass and
salutes Desmond.

CUT TO:

INT. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CAR - EVENING

Desmond, in his dress uniform, rides along a two-lane road,
lost in thought.

EXT. DOSS FRONT YARD - EVENING

Tom Doss stands out in the yard, clutching a liquor bottle,

conflicted. He brings the bottle up but instead of drinking
from it, he tosses it as hard as he can.
3.4.13 104.

Tom starts to turn away but then reconsiders. He walks
toward where he threw the bottle, and as he reaches down to
pick it up, he notices the rock with Desmond’s note. He
picks up the bottle and then the rock. As he stands reading
the note, his eyes tear up. He turns the bottle upside down
and pours it out.

EXT. DOROTHY’S HOUSE - NIGHT
A DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CAR pulls up to Dorothy’s house, the
brakes squealing as it does. Fear freezes Dorothy
immediately-- but it’s Desmond she sees limping out of the
car. She runs to him and throws her arms around him. We see
them both slowly kiss as the screen fades to black.

DISSOLVE TO:
EPILOGUE: HISTORIC PHOTO OF DESMOND AND PRESIDENT HARRY
TRUMAN

A beaming Harry Truman hangs the Medal of Honor around
Desmond’s neck.

TITLES (in separate cards):

Desmond Doss was presented the Medal of Honor - the first
conscientious objector to win America's highest award for
courage under fire.

Of his own heroics, he remained characteristically modest,
giving all the credit to his Faith and saying simply, “The
real heroes are buried over there.”

He passed away at the age of 87 in March, 2006 and was buried
in Arlington Cemetery.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END.
