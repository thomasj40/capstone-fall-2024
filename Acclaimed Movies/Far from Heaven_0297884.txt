Hartford, Connecticut, 1957

EXT. NEW ENGLAND VILLAGE - DAY

The bells of a Gothic church are ringing down upon a comely
square near downtown Hartford. The crisp fall day is alive
with color, as cornflower skies burst through the autumn reds
and golds, setting off the clean brick buildings and freshly
painted homes that so proudly distinguish this New England
township.

Music over OPENING CREDITS.

We see a powder blue, ‘56 Chevrolet turn onto the main road
its way into town.

EXT. VILLAGE ST. - DAY

The Chevrolet stops in front of a small dance school just off
State St. and an attractive, red-haired woman in her mid-
thirties emerges from the car, wearing sunglasses and a
scarf. She says hello to a mother and daughter exiting the
school on her way inside, returning a moment later with a
strawberry-haired girl in ballet clothes. CATHY WHITAKER, -
having collected her 8-year-old daughter JANICE from ballet
class is finally returning home from another busy day.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - LATER

Cathy's car is turning onto a well-tended, residential
street, full of traditional black-shuttered, white wood
homes, each set back on spacious lawns against, the blaze of
autumn color

EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - LATER

She turns into the driveway of a large, fastidiously
landscaped 2-story home, with a slate roof and flagstone
walkway. DAVID WHITAKER, a typical 11-year-old boy, with-dark
hair like his dad’s, is circling around the front of the
house on his bright red Schwinn:

DAVID
Mother! Mother! Can I sleep over at
Hutch's tonight? Mrs. Hutchinson
gave permission.

CATHY

(from the car)

Not tonight, David.
(MORE)
CATHY(cont 'd)
Your father, and I are going out
and I need you to, look after your
sister.

DAVID
Aww, shucks.

CATHY
Now move your school bag, David, so
mother can park.

The Whitaker's maid SYBIL, a handsome black woman in her
early 30's, is just coming down the front steps to the car.,

JANICE
(hopping out)
Sherry Seeger says they only' cost
something like five or six dollars
Please mother, please can I?

CATHY
(opening her door)
Oh Sybil, thank heavens!

SYBIL
Well I knew you were going to the
grocery -

CATHY
David, please help Sybil unload the
car.

DAVID
How come Janice doesn’t gotta?

CATHY
Doesn't have to. Because Janice is
carrying in all her, belongings an
marching straight upstairs into the
bath.

She steps out of the car loaded down with laundered clothes
and packages.

CATHY
Your father and I have an
engagement so I want you both to
have a nice early dinner. And help
Sybil.

DAVID/ JANICE
(not exactly in sync)
Yes, ma’am.
CATHY
Sybil, did Mr. Whitaker call while
I was out?

SYBIL
No, Mrs. Whitaker. Not since you've
been gone.

CATHY

How do you like that guy. Big time
executive and he still can't
remember a single social
obligation!

JANICE
So mother can I? Please can I get
them?

CATHY
Janice I said we'll discuss it with
your father. Now hurry on inside.
David, put your bike away and help
Sybil with the groceries! Where's
your jacket?

DAVID
Inside.

Cathy turns to see her best friend ELEANOR FINE, a lean
blond woman in her early 40's, just turning up her drive ina
shiny green Imperial.

CATHY
Well hello, stranger! Aren't I
seeing you in about three hours
time?

Eleanor is stepping out of her car.
ELEANOR

You are. But I just left the
caterers this instant and I had to

dash over.
CATHY
You have the samples?
ELEANOR
You bet.
CATHY

Ooh. Come inside.
They start into the house.

ELEANOR
I can only stay a second.

CATHY
You just caught me, actually -
David! what did I tell you?

DAVID
I'm getting the last bag!

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WHITAKER LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Inside, Janice is practicing some ballet steps by a large

stone fireplace. Eleanor is in the midst of showing Cathy

color samples for the big company party it is their annual
venture to host.

ELEANOR
And imagine with the table setting
I showed you. The aqua trim? Is
that smart?

CATHY
Oh yes.

ELEANOR
You like?

CATHY
Mmm-hmm.

ELEANOR
(starting to put things
away )
Alright. So I'll call the caterers
in the morning and you confirm with
Dorothy on the deposit - and honey,
we're in business.

CATHY
Magnavox ‘57, here we come.

ELEANOR
You betcha.

JANICE
Mother, look!
CATHY
Janice I thought I told you to go
start your bath! You know your
father and I -

JANICE
Just this one part, pleeease.

CATHY
Alright, bunt lickety-split.

Janice performs a few steps for her mother and Eleanor as
David pours over the TV guide on the couch.

ELEANOR
Oh, will you look at that?

CATHY
That's lovely darling.

ELEANOR
She's getting so grown up.

DAVID
Mother, can I stay up and watch The
Californians - Please!

CATHY
Janice, honey, watch the lamp!

JANICE
Ta-da!

Eleanor and Cathy applaud Janice who beams in delight.

ELEANOR
Ohh!

CATHY
That was lovely, dear. Now hurry on
up and get out of those clothes or
mother's going to be late.

Janice turns, still beaming, and dashes up the stairs.

ELEANOR
I better run. I still have loads to
do.

CATHY

Well I can imagine, with Mona
Lauder and that little white glove
of hers...
ELEANOR
Aren't social mores the most
dreadful bore? Mona's invited us at
least three times last year so of
course there wasn't a thing I could
do. And Stan sees Fred at the
club...

Cathy opens the door for her.

EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - LATER

Eleanor starts down the front steps of the house toward her
car.

CATHY
Thanks for stopping by.

ELEANOR
I'll see you at eight!

CATHY
You know Frank. On the dot!

Cathy waves goodbye and closes the door.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WHITAKER'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Janice is curled into an armchair in the soft glow of Cathy's
vanity, watching her mother do her make-up in the mirror.
Cathy is dressed for the evening in sleeveless emerald green,
setting off the tangerine of her hair.

JANICE
Mother?
CATHY
(doing her lipstick)
Uh-huh?
JANICE

When you were a little girl you
looked like me, right?

CATHY
Uh-huh.
JANICE
So when I grow up does that mean
I'll look like you?

CATHY
Is that what you want darling, to
look like me?

JANICE
Yes. I hope I look exactly as
pretty as you.

CATHY
What a lovely compliment coming
from my perfectly lovely daughter.

She picks up her wristwatch and glances at the time.

CATHY
Seven-fifteen!, Where on earth is
your father?

She gets up and walks over to a dresser.

JANICE
Mother?

CATHY
(searching for something)
What is it, dear?

JANICE
Can I try putting lipstick on me?

CATHY
(starting out the door)
Not tonight, Janice. Mother’s going
to be late. Sybil!

INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Cathy is starting down the stairs.

SYBIL
(off)
Yes, Mrs. Whitaker?

CATHY
Did I leave my gloves on the hall
table?
SYBIL
(off)
Yes, ma’am. I see them.

CATHY
You know it's nearly twenty after
and Mr. Whitaker still hasn't
phoned!

Sybil meets Cathy at the foot of the stairs with the gloves.

CATHY
Thank you, Sybil... - I'm at my
wits end. I even tried calling his
office, though I knew there
wouldn't be anyone -

The phone RINGS. Sybil goes to the hall table to answer it.

CATHY
Well I certainly hope that's him
now. Because if it isn't -

SYBIL
Whitaker residence.
(brief silence, then
stiffly)
Yes sir. One moment, please.

CATHY
Who is it?

SYBIL
(Lowered voice)
Police department.

Cathy frowns, taking the phone.

CATHY
Hello?

OFFICER'S VOICE
(through receiver)
Yes. Am I speaking with a Mrs.
Frank Whitaker?

CATHY
Yes.

OFFICER'S VOICE
Of 1616 Sycamore Drive?
CATHY
Yes.

INT. POLICE STATION BOOKING - EVENING

OFFICER
One moment please.

The OFFICER hands the phone over to FRANK WHITAKER, a dark-
haired, big-boned man in his early forties, who has just
finished wiping his ink-stained fingers with a rag.

FRANK
Cathy?

CATHY'S VOICE
Frank! Frank, what happened? Are
you alright?

FRANK
I'm fine. Everything's fine. It was
a big - mix-up, the whole thing.
But you gotta come get me. They
won't - let me leave on my own.

INT. WHITAKER FOYER - EVENING

CATHY
Oh, Frank. Don't worry, darling.
I'll be there as quickly as I can.
(she hangs up the phone)

SYBIL
Is there anything I can do, Mrs.
Whitaker?

CATHY

No. Thank you Sybil. Just keep an
eye on the children. I'm sure I
won't be long.

Cathy grabs her purse and coat and rushes for the door.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Cathy's car pulls up in front of the lamp-lit police station
She hurries out of the car, still in her evening clothes, and
up the stone steps of the precinct
10.

INT. POLICE STATION FRONT DESK - CONTINUOUS
Cathy walks over to the OFFICER at the desk

OFFICER
Can I help you ma’am?

CATHY
Yes, I'm here to meet my husband.
The name's Whitaker, Frank
Whitaker.

OFFICER
Here we go. Room 103. If you'll
follow me, ma'am.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BOOKING - LATER
Cathy signs the report and hands it to the BAIL CLERK.

BAIL CLERK
This is your copy, ma'am, and your
receipt.

CATHY
Thank you.

Then the door opens and Frank walks through it.

CATHY
Oh, Frank!

Cathy rushes to him and they embrace.

As they leave, two of the officers are still watching.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Cathy drives while Frank broods in the passenger seat. REAR-
PROJECTED streetlights send charcoal shadows across their
faces.

FRANK
I'll tell you one thing. If it
hadn't been for that sniveling
junior cop they'd have never gone
through the whole charade in the
first place!... /

(MORE)
11.

FRANK(cont 'd)
Stead of trying to save face. I saw
the guy they were after - the
‘loiterer’. They wouldn't even
listen to me! I tell you, I have
half a mind to sue the pants off
the whole precinct.

CATHY
Or... you could simply forget the
whole thing ever happened.

FRANK
(takes a breath)
I suppose you're right.

Brief silence.

CATHY
(a bit cautiously)
So were there - drinks after work?

FRANK
What do you mean?

CATHY
I thought they said something...
Intoxication level, something-or-
other - ?

FRANK
Christ! I had a lousy cocktail with
Bill after work, going over the
portfolio! Should I be arrested for
that too?

CATHY
Of course not, darling.

FRANK
The whole thing’s just put me ina
fowl state.

CATHY
I know, dear. You just try to rest.
We’1l be home in no time.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WHITAKER FOYER - LATER

Cathy stands in semi-darkness, on the phone with Eleanor. She
finds the police report in her purse.
12.

CATHY
He’s fine... The car’s fine. Frank
says it was the bumper that got
hit, but you know me. I can’t tell
the difference... I’m just sorry we
had to miss it... I know...

She drops the papers into the waste-basket.

INT. WHITAKER BEDROOM - LATER

Frank sits in bed with an open book on his lap, staring into
space. The door squeaks open and he looks over.

CATHY
She was fine. Said it was a
dreadful bore, what with Mona
Lauder and her gossip.

FRANK
(depleted)
Cathy, I’m sorry.

CATHY
(embracing him)
Darling, you’ve nothing to be sorry
for. It was all just a silly
wretched mistake!

They kiss deeply and he takes her in his arms. Cathy closes
her eyes and begins caressing his shoulders and neck. But
Frank stops and pulls away. She looks at him.

FRANK
Feel so tired.

He turns and lays down into bed and she caresses the side of
his head with her hand.

CATHY
Course you do. You sleep now.

She switches off the light, pulls up his blanket and slowly
walks to the bathroom.
INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING

The Whitaker clan are all seated around the breakfast room
table finishing a breakfast of bacon and eggs.
13.

DAVID
Pop, Hutch says if the Russian's
drop a bomb on us we couldn't drop
one back on them. Is that true?

FRANK
Well, son, I'm afraid Hutch has a
point there.

DAVID

Why, pop? Why couldn't we?
CATHY

Drink your orange juice David.
JANICE

I already drank mine. Look father!
FRANK

Attagirl!
DAVID

Pop, why?
CATHY

(glancing at the clock)
Would you look at the time? It's
already a quarter after! You kids
are going to miss your bus! Sybil
can you help me get their coats?

Sybil helps Cathy distribute coats and lunch-boxes, and hurry
them out of the kitchen.

CATHY
Alright, now. Say goodbye to your
father.
JANICE
Bye, father.
(she kisses him)
FRANK
Goodbye, kitten.
DAVID
Bye, pop!
FRANK

Have a good day at school, son.

David is first out the door.
14.

CATHY

Janice, have you got your notebook?
JANICE

Yes, Mother.

David swings open the front door of the house. We can hear
the bus approaching.

DAVID
(off)
The bus is here!

SYBIL
David - your lunch!

Cathy takes it from Sybil and rushes after him.

INT. DEN - MORNING

CATHY
David!

He swoops back in, grabs it, and is off again, followed by
Janice.

JANICE
Bye, mother!

CATHY
Have a nice day at school, dear

Cathy pecks her on the cheek and she runs out the door.

EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - MORNING

The bus pulls up in front of the house as David and Janice go
running and Cathy waves.

CATHY
Bye!

The big yellow door closes behind them and the bus pulls off
down the street. A small truck is just pulling up to the
house which reads DEAGAN GARDEN SUPPLY.

INT. DEN - MORNING

Cathy is walking back' into the house as Frank emerges from
the kitchen, gathering his things for work.
15.

CATHY
I thought you were going to have
another piece of toast?

FRANK
It's late. I should get over there.

CATHY
Well can I at least fix you lunch?

FRANK
No, thank you, dear. I've got lunch
meetings all week long. It's
portfolio season!

The doorbell rings.

CATHY
(calling)
Sybil, if that's the milkman, his
check is in the kitchen drawer!

SYBIL
(off)
Yes, ma’am!

Cathy helps Frank on with his overcoat

CATHY
Well I'm just glad you're feeling
better, dear.

FRANK
Thank you, darling.

Frank embraces Cathy and kisses her warmly just as - BOOM! -
a camera flash ignites them, and they turn.

Standing beside Sybil in the entryway is MRS. LEACOCK , a
grey-faced woman in her 60's, and a young PHOTOGRAPHER with a
camera.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Pardon me, ma'am, sir.

SYBIL
Excuse me, Mrs. Whitaker. This is -
Mrs. Leacock? She says she had an
appointment with you this morning?
16.

CATHY
Oh Jimminy - I completely forgot
the time! Yes, of course, Mrs.
Leacock, please come in.

MRS. LEACOCK
I do apologize, Mrs. Whitaker, but
candid views are always the best.

CATHY
Darling, this is Mrs. Leacock, the
lady I told you about, from the
Weekly Gazette.

FRANK
Ah, yes. The fine lady who wants to
air all our dirty secrets.
(shaking her hand)
How do you do, Mrs. Leacock?

MRS. LEACOCK
Fear not, Mr. Whitaker. We at the
Gazette ascribe to only the highest
of professional standards.

FRANK
Well I'm glad to hear it. Now if
you'll all please excuse me, I have
some professional standards of my
own to keep up.
(kissing Cathy)
Goodbye, darling.

CATHY
Goodbye, dear.

FRANK
(nodding goodbye)
Mrs. Leacock...

MRS. LEACOCK
Pleasure, Mr. Whitaker.

Franks gives a final wave to the room and is gone.

MRS. LEACOCK
Your husband's a very charming man
Mrs. Whitaker.

CATHY
Thank you. We're rather fond of him
ourselves. Please, won't you come
in and make yourselves at home.
17.

Cathy escorts them into the living room and over to the couch
while untying her kitchen apron.

Cathy

dress.

CATHY
AS you can see, I'm just running a
bit behind schedule today.

MRS. LEACOCK
That's quite alright, dear.

sits down opposite her, casually smoothing her hair and

CATHY
I suppose I still can't imagine why
in the world you’d want an
interview with me in the first
place. It couldn't possibly be very
interesting for your readers.

MRS. LEACOCK
The readers of the Weekly Gazette,
Mrs. Whitaker, are women just like
yourself, with families and homes
to keep up. A good society paper
need not be a gossip rag. You are
the proud wife of a successful
sales executive, planning the
parties and posing at her husband's
side on the advertisements.

She refers to a framed magazine advertisement on the wall,
showing Cathy and Frank posed in front of their TV with the
heading: MR. & MRS. MAGNAVOX CHOOSE NOTHING BUT THE BEST FOR
THEIR HOME!

Suddenly,

MRS. LEACOCK
To everyone here in Connecticut you
are Mr. and Mrs. Magnavox.

CATHY
I suppose I should be flattered. I
just don't feel I'm so very
different from anyone else, really.
I like to shop and wear a pretty
dress every now and then. But
really my life is just like any
other wife or mother's - I don't
suppose I've ever really wanted
anything -

through the window, Cathy glimpses someone moving

through her backyard. She stands.
18.

MRS. LEACOCK
What is it, dear?

CATHY
I think I just saw someone walking
through our yard.

Cathy walks to the french doors leading to the backyard.
There she sees

A tall black man standing outside, hunching over something.

CATHY
What on earth...?

MRS. LEACOCK
(standing, seeing)
Oh my.

Cathy opens the door.

MRS. LEACOCK
Mrs. Whitaker - Perhaps you should
call the police -

EXT. WHITAKER BACKYARD - DAY

The Whitaker backyard is an ample, two-tiered expanse, with
flagstone walkways and fastidiously landscaped hedges, trees
and flower-beds bordering the swimming-pool and lawn.

Cathy takes a few cautious steps in the direction of the
stranger.

CATHY
Excuse me. Can I help you?

The man looks up from a shrub of evergreens, squinting. This
is RAYMOND DEAGAN, 40 years old, good-looking. He steps
toward her, looking slightly irritated himself.

Cathy takes an involuntary step back

CATHY
Who are you?

RAYMOND
Ma'am, I'm sorry. My name's Raymond
Deagan. I'm Otis Deagan's son. I've
just been - taking over some of his
jobs since he -
19.

CATHY
You're Otis's son?

RAYMOND
Yes.

CATHY

Well I'm - terribly sorry for
speaking to you in that manner. I
didn't know who was in my yard.

RAYMOND
No need.

CATHY
How is your father? I knew he was
in the hospital.

RAYMOND
Yes, I - My father passed away, I'm
afraid.

CATHY

No! I had no idea! I'm so very
sorry.

(putting her hand on his

arm)
Please accept our deepest
condolences. Your father was a
wonderful, dedicated man.

RAYMOND
Thank you.

The phone rings from inside the house.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
We hear Sybil answering it as Mrs. Leacock watches Cathy
through the window - just removing her hand from Raymond's
arm.
EXT. BACKYARD - DAY
Sybil steps out to the porch from the kitchen door

SYBIL

Mrs. Whitaker? I have Greenhill
Caterers,on the line!
20.

CATHY
Thank you, Sybil!
(to Raymond)
I'm sorry. Would you excuse me a
moment?

RAYMOND
Of course.

Cathy hurries back inside.
CATHY
Mrs. Leacock, I'm terribly sorry!
I'll just be a minute more!

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MAGNAVOX OFFICES - DAY

Frank is walking briskly down the wide passageway of his
floor at Magnavox, passing secretarial pools and other
employees with a smile. Triangles of morning sun bleach the
wood-paneled walls of the floor's lean, modern decor

He passes a sprite little secretary named Kitty.

KITTY
Good morning, Mr. Whitaker.

FRANK
Morning Kitty. Lovely dress you're
wearing.

KITTY

Thank you, sir.

Frank continues on towards the outer office of the executive
suite where his secretary, MARLENE, is stationed beneath a
large abstract wall-hanging.

Standing opposite, pooling over a file is STAN FINE,
Eleanor's husband, a tall, slightly greying man with a belly,
who works right below Frank in the Hartford division.

FRANK
Morning, Marlene, Stan!

MARLENE
Good morning, Mr. Whitaker.
21.

STAN
So how's the second best golfer in
Hartford this morning?

FRANK
Someone break the books already?
Don't tell me our wives' party
budgets have finally come in.

STAN
Almost as fatal. Millstein called.
Looks like New York just shaved a
week off portfolio deadline.

FRANK
You gotta be kidding me.

STAN
I wish I were.

FRANK
What're they trying to do, strangle
us to death?! Does Dennis know?

STAN
Called him first thing.

FRANK
Alright. Get Dennis and the others
and call a portfolio meeting for
lunch today. Marlene, see if you
can move production review to
dinner.

MARLENE
Yes, sir.

FRANK
And would you get my wife on the
phone?
(to Stan)
Thanks, Stan.

Frank pats Stan on the shoulder and marches through the large
wood-paneled door of his office.

INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Frank drops his briefcase and sits down heavily at the large,
handsomely ornamented desk.
22.

He takes a breath before turning and quietly opening a lower
drawer, pulling out a quart of Jack Daniels and pouring a
swig into his coffee. As he stashes it away we hear

MARLENE
(on intercom)
Sir? I have Mrs. Whitaker on line
1.

FRANK
Thank you, Marlene.

Frank takes a slurp, swallows and pushes line 1 on his phone.
FRANK
Cathy, is that you, dear?
INT. WHITAKER FOYER - MORNING

Cathy speaks to Frank from the phone in the hall.

CATHY
Did you forget something?... Oh,
Frank... I’m sorry, dear... No, I
understand... I just wish you

wouldn’t overwork yourself, Frank.
Especially after... I know - I
know, dear... I will... See you
then... Goodbye, dear.

Cathy hangs up the phone and starts back into the living
room.

CATHY
I’m terribly sorry for the
interruptions. Where was it you
wanted me?

PHOTOGRAPHER
Just one more at the fireplace.

Cathy walks over to the fireplace where she puts one hand on
the mantle and turns toward the photographer.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Right there. Now smile.

Cathy smiles.

MRS. LEACOCK
Isn't that darling.
23.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Hold it...

FLASH.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DOWNTOWN HARTFORD - NIGHT

We descend from a moonlit night past the Hartford skyline to
the awning of Sammy's Steakhouse, where Frank and four STAFF
MEMBERS are just emerging.

FRANK
(slightly slurred)
Well I guess that about wraps it
up
(shaking hands) )
Bob, Rick. Gentlemen.

STAFF MEMBER 1
You're sure you're alright getting
home, sir?

FRANK
Thank you, Davis. But as 2nd in
command of the US McMillan I do
feel equipped to locate my car
without cover.

STAFF MEMBER 1
Very good, sir.

FRANK
Bright and early gentlemen!

They say goodnight and we follow Frank as he proceeds down
the pink, lamplit blocks of downtown Hartford.

He passes teenagers clumped in cars, making out.
He passes a HOOKER.

HOOKER
Where ya headed, tiger?

Frank looks away as he passes. When he looks up again he sees

The marquee of a movie theater glowing up ahead.
24.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Frank approaches the tungsten awning of the old, 20's-style
cinema, currently featuring half-price double-bills. He
stops.

The marquee reads: THREE FACES OF EVE and MIRACLE IN THE
RAIN.

INT. MOVIE THEATER - LATER

ONSCREEN: We are in the middle of THREE FACES OF EVE. Raymond
Burr is questioning one of Joanne Woodward's more timid
personalities.

Frank is walking in from the rear of the theater. He stops
along the back wall and stands watching, muted in shadow like
Edward Hopper's usherette.

ONSCREEN: Joanne Woodward is becoming agitated. She starts
switching into another personality.

A dark-haired man is getting up from his seat and walking in
the direction of the Gentleman's Lounge. Frank notices him
pausing a moment at the foot of the small, carpeted stairway
just as a second man approaches. The dark-haired man spots
the second one and proceeds briskly down the stairs. The
second man follows, looking around nervously as he goes.

Frank stares darkly down the empty corridor.

INT. WHITAKER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cathy sits in the lilac glow of her lamp-lit writing table,
addresses party gunshots can be heard from downstairs.

Cathy turns the face of her desk-clock to see the time. It
reads 10:36.

CATHY
(getting up)
Oh, for heavens sake... DAVID!

INT. WHITAKER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Music escorts us from the dark of the living room to the

chestnut glow of the den where David sits watching
television.
25.

Sybil inventories serving ware in the dining room, as Cathy
makes her way downstairs with writing tablet and pen.

CATHY
David, this is the third time I've
told you to turn that infernal
racket off and get into bed! Do you
know what time it is?

DAVID
Mother please can I just this once
stay up and watch the -

CATHY
No, David, you most certainly may
not and that is final.

DAVID
(reluctantly turning it
off)
Ah, jeez...

CATHY
That's not the sort of language we
use in this house! Now march! And
don't forget to wash your teeth!

As David swaggers off Cathy straightens up the couch.

CATHY
Oh, Sybil, be sure and check dinner
forks as well. I seem to recall
being short last year.

SYBIL
I thought it was salad forks we
were short on.

Cathy begins closing drapes in the living room windows.

CATHY
Perhaps you're right. Whatever it
was, I'd like to try and order a
set before the party.

SYBIL
That shouldn't be a problem.

CATHY
You know, Sybil, I think this may
just turn out to be our best one
yet.
26.

SYBIL
Well I'm sure Mr. Whitaker will be
extremely proud.

Cathy turns off a lamp by the window and parts the drapes a
moment.

She glances out into the silent, blue-edged night.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

A man on a ladder is replacing the letters on the theater
marquee as Frank files out of the theater amid the strange
week-night crowd. He stops a moment beneath the canopy of
bulbs.

There's a trill of laughter from down the street and Frank
turns.

The two men from the movie theater are walking off, one of
them laughing. They turn the corner.

Frank squints, looking after. And with a frown of curiosity
and some unsteadiness, he begins to follow.

EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT

The two men are crossing the shadowy side-street. One of them
can still be heard as they approach a dark, inconspicuous
door, a few steps down from street-level. They open it,
sending a sudden flood of green into the darkness, then
quickly vanish inside.

Frank stares after, stuck between intrigue and fear. He
follows.

INT. FRAN'S - NIGHT

Fran's is a small, burgundy-walled “gentlemen's bar', with
black upholstery and a mint-green light embalming its well-
groomed clientele - most of whom take subtle notice of Frank
as he enters the room. Out of nowhere a voice is heard -

VOICE
Identification please.

FRANK
(turning, startled)
What?
27.

A thin man in his 50's with a pencil-thin mustache stands
beside the door.

MAN WITH MUSTACHE
Identification, drivers license.

FRANK
Oh. Sure.

Frank shows him his wallet

MAN WITH MUSTACHE
Thank you, sir. Have a pleasant
evening.

FRANK
Thank you.

Frank proceeds cautiously into the room, heading to the bar.
A SPANISH BARTENDER accent nods slowly as he approaches.

SPANISH BARTENDER
Yes, sir? What can I get you this
evening?

FRANK
Just a Johnny Walker, please. Neat.

SPANISH BARTENDER
Yes, sir.

Frank takes out a cigarette and lights it. He glances stiffly
across the room.

The plucked and coiffed patrons, seated mostly alone, glance
back with the same stiff, self-consciousness. The men from
the theater sit in some corner rapt in conversation.

Frank's drink is set on the bar and he takes a fast, deep
sip, shiny with perspiration.

Frank puts down a bill and takes a long, relaxing drag off
his cigarette.

VOICE
One more of the same.

Frank looks over and sees a clean-cut BLOND MAN (early 30's)
at the bar. He exhales.

The blond man glances over and smiles cautiously. Frank
smiles cautiously back
28.

BARTENDER
There you are, sir.

The blond man remains looking at Frank a moment before
picking up his drink and starting back to his table.

Frank watches him go.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WHITAKER FOYER - NIGHT

Frank closes the front door behind him and starts slowly up
the stairs of the house, black on shadowy blue, as a slow
burden of music rises.

He stops at the foot of his bedroom door and stares at

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Cathy, copper and blue, asleep in bed.
Music lightens as we

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - DAY

We float out from a newspaper photograph of Frank and Cathy
kissing in the latest Hartford Weekly Gazette to reveal
Eleanor, reading aloud from the paper. The door to the house
is open as Cathy and her arriving guests, DOREEN and NANCY,
stand around listening, having obviously been stopped in
their tracks to do so. Cathy holds a lilac scarf under her
chin as a feisty wind whips through the trees and sends a
circus of leaves through the sky.

ELEANOR
‘So does the fabled maxim hold that
behind every great man there
resides a great lady? In this case -
wife, mother and Mrs. Magnovox
herself - Cathleen Whitaker proves
that it does, a woman as devoted to
her family as she is kind to
Negroes’!!

They burst into laughter.
29.

DOREEN
To Negroes?!

CATHY
(grabbing the paper)
Let me see that! Oh my heavens.
What on earth was that woman
thinking?

NANCY
How did that come up?

ELEANOR
Cathy? Oh she's been liberal ever
since she played summer stock at
college with all those steamy
Jewish boys! Why do you think they
used to call her red!

CATHY
Oh for heaven sakes, come inside.
Before Joe McCarthy comes driving
by!

Eleanor laughs and Cathy hands her back the paper.

ELEANOR
Here.

Suddenly a strong gust of wind sweeps Cathy's scarf right off
her head and up over the side of the house.

DOREEN
Uh-oh!

CATHY
Oh, no! I love that scarf!

DOREEN
Oh, I'm sure it just blew behind
the house somewhere.

CATHY
Oh, for heaven's sake.

They continue back inside the house.

ELEANOR
This really isn't your day, is it?

NANCY
So did they really call you ‘red’?
30.

Eleanor laughs some more.

CATHY
Oh Nancy, honestly!

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

The ladies are just finishing lunch, a bit tipsy from the
daiquiris.

CATHY
Can I get anyone another daiquiri?
NANCY
Oh no. One's my limit.
DOREEN
Better not.
CATHY

El?
Eleanor holds out her glass. Cathy smiles, refilling it.

ELEANOR
Thanks doll.
(takes a sip)
Alright now girls, no more beating
around the bush. Nancy?

NANCY
I can't.
ELEANOR
Come on now. Can't be that bad.
NANCY
Alright.
(she smiles bashfully)
Well... Mike insists on once a
week.

The laddies giggle, except for Cathy, who stands holding the
pitcher of daiquiris.

ELEANOR
Ah, you got off easy!

CATHY
Once a week?
31.

DOREEN
Yea, you’re lucky. Ron’s more like
two or three.

NANCY
Really? Three?

DOREEN
And how.

ELEANOR

That’s nothing. Girlfriend of mine?

(to Cathy)
Shirley Dawson -

(back to everyone)
Her husband? Every night-o-the-
week... plus three times more on
the weekend! Can you imagine?

Cathy returns the pitcher to the bar.

NANCY

Oh, my.
DOREEN

How long have they been married?
ELEANOR

Well, long enough! Seven years?

Eight?
Doreen and Nancy break into more giggles as Cathy stands a
moment, reflected in thought in the marbled mirror, a note of
music accompanying.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - LATER

Cathy stands in front of her house waiving goodbye to
Eleanor, Doreen and Nancy, who make their way to their cars.

DOREEN
It was lovely, Cathleen!

CATHY
Thanks, girls.

DOREEN
Bye, now.
32.

ELEANOR
Chicken was divine.

CATHY
Thanks, El.

ELEANOR
I’1l1 call you tomorrow!

CATHY
Bye.

ELEANOR
Thanks again, hon! It was all too
divine!

CATHY

Thanks, El. I'll call you tomorrow.

ELEANOR
Bye!
Cathy is about to turn back into the house when she puts a
hand to her head, remembering her scarf. She glances over
toward the side of the house and starts slowly down the front
steps, glancing around the yard as she goes.

By now the wind has died down and a pale opal light has taken
the edge off the sun.

A soft spell of music begins.

She doesn't see it along the front hedges and continues on to
the side of the house. She turns the corner, glancing up at
the roof.

Suddenly

RAYMOND
Could this possibly -

Cathy turns with a start.

Raymond is standing along the side of the house holding her
lilac scarf.

RAYMOND
I'm sorry.

CATHY
No - You found it!
33.

RAYMOND
Yes - It was...
(starts walking toward
her)
hanging off one of the birch's down
front.

CATHY
It's just been so windy. I was just
going back in the house when it
just -

Raymond hands Cathy the scarf.

CATHY
. sailed off my head - Thank you.

RAYMOND
I had a feeling it might have been
yours.

CATHY
Who else could have been so
absentminded?

RAYMOND
No. The color. Just seemed right.

CATHY
Well thank you, Mr. Deagan. For
finding it.

RAYMOND
Please. Call me Raymond.

CATHY
Thank you. Raymond.

She smiles and they begin walking back to the front yard.

CATHY
Everything looks wonderful by the
way.

RAYMOND

Well good. Pop’s a tough act to
follow when it comes to his work.
But I think we got everything
pretty under control.

Cathy looks at him a moment.
34.

CATHY
I’m sure it hasn’t been easy.
Taking over for your father so
quickly.

RAYMOND
Well I guess between pa’s business
my shop, and looking after my
little girl, there’s not much time
left for reflecting.

CATHY
I didn't know you had children.

RAYMOND
Just the one. Sarah's her name.

CATHY
And how old is Sarah?

RAYMOND
Eleven years old, yea. And the sun
and the moon to me.

CATHY
Well I'm sure she's a lovely child.
You and your wife must be very
proud.

RAYMOND
Well, Mrs. Deagan - my wife - she
passed away when Sarah was about
five.

CATHY
Oh Raymond. I'm so sorry.

RAYMOND
Well. Thank you. We do - we do just
fine, Sarah and I.
(reaching for his wallet)
I have a - picture somewhere...
(opening it for Cathy)
There. That's Sarah.

CATHY
Oh, she's darling. Look at those
eyes... And what's this I hear

about a shop?

RAYMOND
The plant shop? Yea. It's just a
little place, down on Hawthorn.
(MORE)
35.

RAYMOND( cont'd)
Started out as a service for
gardeners, ordering plants and
fertilizer. ‘Til I opened the
store. ‘Bout six years ago. The
only thing that business degree's
been good for yet.

CATHY
Well that's marvelous, Raymond. You
should be very proud.

RAYMOND
Well. If you’re ever in the
neighborhood you be sure and stop
by. We have some lovely
houseplants.

CATHY
Well I certainly will.

RAYMOND
Alright then.

She smiles goodbye and walks back into the house.

INT. WHITAKER FOYER - LATER

Cathy closes the door behind her. Right away we hear Sybil
from the kitchen door.

SYBIL
(off)
Mrs. Whitaker? I have that list
whenever you’re ready!

CATHY

Thanks, Sybil. I’1l come get it
now. Where has this day gone to?

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WHITAKER BREAKFAST ROOM - EVENING

From just outside the blaze of the kitchen we find Cathy and
Sybil busily serving dinner to the children.

CATHY
Elbows off the table, David!

JANICE
Eeuu - I hate those!
36.

CATHY
I’m sorry, Janice. But for a
growing girl, who needs her
vitamins and is studying ballet -

JANICE
Oh mother! You said... You said -

CATHY
I said we would discuss it and we
discussed it. Now I don’t want to
hear another word about it. I
certainly don't like thinking I've
raised such spoiled children.

DAVID
What do you mean children? I'm not
the one who wants some dopey ballet
shoes!

JANICE
Slippers!

The telephone rings. Sybil is carrying a tray of food.

CATHY
If that's your father... Don't
worry, Sybil, I'll get it.

(she picks up the phone)
Hello? Frank? You haven't left?...
Oh no, not again... I know Frank
but every week... I know, I know
darling... I won't... Alright...
Goodnight, dear.

(she hangs up the phone)

DAVID
What! He's not coming home again?

JANICE
Father never wants to come home!

CATHY
Oh Janice, he most certainly does.
It's just a terribly busy time for
your father right now, and he's
under a great deal of strain.

DAVID
(to Janice)
Yea!
37.

JANICE
Shut up.

CATHY
You know what, Sybil? Wrap up a
plate for Mr. Whitaker. I'm just
gonna go and take it over there
myself.

SYBIL
All the way downtown?

CATHY
It's really not so far. Anyway, the
children are nearly through, and
knowing Mr. Whitaker, I'll at least
be sparing him another night of
pretzels and coffee.

Cathy picks up her coat from a corner chair and starts out
the door as we

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. OFFICE BLDG. LOBBY - NIGHT

Cathy, emerging through the shimmer of a revolving door, as
quiet dissonance emerges, building slowly throughout the
scene. She walks across the large marble-floored lobby,
Tupperware in hand, to the night-watch's table.

CATHY
I'm just dropping something off to
my husband on the twelfth floor
Mr. Whitaker.

The NIGHT-WATCH motions her in and Cathy continues briskly to
the elevators.

INT. 12TH FLOOR - NIGHT

The elevator doors open. Cathy steps out onto the darkened
floor and starts down the central corridor toward the
executive suite.

As she approaches the outer office she realizes there is no
one else in sight, no lights, no sign of work.

CATHY
(to herself, perplexed)
Frank?
38.

She glances around as she continues, doubtfully, in the
direction of his office. Then she notices

A soft strip of light coming from beneath his office door

CATHY
(shaking her head)
Oh, Frank...

In a rush of wifely sympathy she walks up to the door and
politely opens it.

CATHY
Frank - ?

INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Instantly she sees it: a shirtless blond man with loosened
pants locked in a writhing kiss with another man in
shirtsleeves, who appears to be fondling him. Immediately
they turn and jolt apart. It takes her a moment to register
that the man in shirtsleeves is Frank.

All at once Cathy gasps, pulling back and turning, dropping
her Tupperware. She shuts her eyes and struggles for breath.

Inside we can hear the men scrambling to dress, knocking
something over in the process.

Suddenly Cathy turns facing the door, reeling, horrified.
Music burns with the weight of realization as she starts back-
stepping slowly, staring out in confusion and disbelief.

She glimpses something through the crack of the door and
stops.

Frank catches sight of her from inside.

Cathy stares.

He looks down. Suddenly the blond man slips out past him,
darting briskly down the hall. He disappears down the
stairwell where we can hear his echoey steps slowly fading
away .

All at once Cathy turns and runs, music returning with
thunder and storm.

FRANK
Cathy!
39.

She runs down the hall to the elevator, bangs on the button
until it opens and throws herself inside.

INT. ELEVATOR - LATER

Cathy gasps for air inside the dim, mirror-lined elevator,
trying to pull her hair over her eyes and shut out the world
forever.

SLOW FADE TO BLACK

EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - LATER

Music bathes the shadowy quiet of the Whitaker exterior, its
darkness brushed blue with moonlight, as we glide in slowly
toward the living room window.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

Music continues as we creep in slowly on Cathy silhouetted
against the glass, frozen in thought. Suddenly there’s the
sound of keys at the door and we stop, silent. Cathy doesn’t
move.

Frank quietly shuts the door behind him and turns around.
Dead, eerie silence.

He removes his coat, hangs it on the rack, and takes a quilt
out of the closet. He turns and stops, sensing something.
Then he sees her.

Cathy just stares. But there’s a new kind of death in her
face.

Frank drops his head. He remains still for several seconds.
Finally

CATHY

(from a strange distance)
Mr. Maynard... left an estimate...
for the roof. I put it in the
kitchen.

(silence)
Twelve hundred something. I assume
you’11 want -

(silence)
a second opinion...
FRANK
Cathy -
CATHY
I can’t -
Silence.
FRANK
I know.

Silence. He drops his head.

FRANK
I don’t -
(doesn’t finish)
CATHY
What?
FRANK

I don't even...
Frank looks up. He sighs with resignation.

FRANK
See... Once. Long time ago. Long
long time ago. I had... problems. I
just figured... that was - that was
it.
(shaking his head)
I never... imagined...

CATHY
You had... problems?

FRANK
Yes.

CATHY
You never... spoke to anyone? A
doctor?

FRANK
No.

CATHY
No one?

Frank shakes his head.

CATHY
I don't... I don't understand.

40.
41.

FRANK
I don't either.
CATHY
What if... I mean there must be

people who - who...

FRANK
I don't know.

CATHY
There must be.

Frank suddenly seems a hundred miles away.

CATHY
Frank?

Frank can barely look at her let alone respond.

CATHY
Because...
(suddenly shaky)
Otherwise, I just - I don't know
what - Oh Frank!

Soft music begins. Frank closes his eyes and quietly nods.
Cathy exhales a tiny breath of relief.

CATHY
(softly)
Thank you.

He slowly-turns and Cathy watches as he starts up the stairs
music expanding.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MEDICAL CENTER - DAY

The last Autumn leaves are falling on this bright, blustery
afternoon in the Hartford business district. Cathy's car can
be seen turning onto the main road and continuing into town.

EXT. MEDICAL CENTER - DAY

The large, modern medical complex stretches out against crisp
blue skies and white clouds. Down below we see Cathy pulling
into the Municipal lot. The white-capped attendant hands her
a ticket, raises the gate and smiles as she proceeds in.
42.

Cathy walks up to the front of one of the buildings, checks
her watch and glances around for Frank.

In a small park opposite, a young couple can be seen leaning
against a tree, kissing. The girl pulls away but the boy
pursues eagerly, stroking the girl's hair and whispering into
her ear.

Cathy watches, closer (with a rear-projected background).

The boy tries kissing her again, but the girl turns away,
glancing toward Cathy self-consciously.

Cathy looks down. She checks her watch again and glances
around one more time for Frank.

We see him now, just crossing the street

Cathy waves, starting over in his direction. They meet and
begin walking up the slope of stairs.

INT. DR. BOWMAN'S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - DAY

The RECEPTIONIST is swinging open the door of the waiting
room.

RECEPTIONIST
Mr. and Mrs. Whitaker .?

CATHY
Yes.

Cathy and Frank get up from their chairs.

DR. Bowman, an imposing man in his fifties with a distinctive
streak of white in his hair, is just stepping through the
door as music fades.

RECEPTIONIST
This is Dr. Bowman.

BOWMAN
(shaking Frank's hand
firmly)
Mr. Whitaker? How do you.
(politely taking Cathy's)
Mrs. Whitaker? How lovely.

CATHY
Thank you.
43.

BOWMAN
Mr. Whitaker, Mrs. Whitaker. As
someone who's been around numerous
couples like yourselves, I realize
how difficult these things can be
at times, particularly at the
beginning. It's been said the first
steps are always the hardest ones
to take. But as I'm oft to remind
my patients, without them, of
course, why we wouldn't even be
walking! So allow me first to
commend you both... for taking
those steps today.

CATHY
Thank you, doctor.

BOWMAN
Before we sit down, are there any
questions I can answer?

Cathy looks to Frank who vaguely gestures ‘no.’

BOWMAN
No? Alright.
(to Frank)
I suppose we may as well get
started.

Dr. Bowman gestures to the door and Cathy starts in first.

BOWMAN
Actually, Mrs. Whitaker, I think it
might be best if your husband and I
conversed - in private.

CATHY
Oh. In private. Of course.

BOWMAN
I think it's best.

CATHY
Certainly. Then I'll - see you
later, dear.

FRANK
See you later.

And they close the door behind them.
44,

Cathy is motionless for a moment before turning back into the
waiting room and sitting down. She smiles at the receptionist
who vaguely smiles back.

She looks back at the door.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DR. BOWMAN'S OFFICE - A BIT LATER

BOWMAN
Today, the general attitude
regarding this sort, of behavior
is, naturally, more modern, more
scientific than it's ever been
before. After all, we're not living
in the dark ages. But for those who
do seek treatment, who possess the
will and desire to lead normal
lives, there still remains only a
scant, 5-to-30 percent rate of
success. For complete heterosexual
conversion. Interestingly, for
many, it's the treatment itself
that often changes the patient's
mind. One thing is certain. A
successful outcome is only ever
achieved when it's what the patient
himself desires more than anything
else in the world.

FRANK
What does it - comprise of? The
treatment.

BOWMAN
Treatment is usually comprised of
psychiatric sessions, twice a week
sometimes more.

FRANK
Just - talking?

BOWMAN
Yes. Though some patients have
explored additional, more
behavioral methods.

FRANK
Behavioral?
45.

BOWMAN
Electro-shock aversion therapy, for
instance, or hormonal re-balancing
procedures. But neither of these
would be part of any standardized
treatment.

Silence. Frank looks down in thought.

BOWMAN

I know it can all seem rather
daunting at first.

(leaning back in his

chair)
I suggest you take some time, think
over the various options we
discussed, discuss it with your
wife -

FRANK
No, I - I already know - I want to
go ahead. Begin treatment.

Frank tries to gather his thoughts.

FRANK

I can't - let this thing destroy my
life - my family's life! I know
it's a sickness because it makes me
feel - despicable, dirty. I promise
you Dr. Bowman, I'm gonna beat this
thing. I'm gonna break it. So help
me God.

The doctor is listening.

CUT TO:

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

The door swings open and Cathy turns to see Frank and Dr.
Bowman step into the waiting room.

BOWMAN
So why don't you go ahead and
confirm the times we discussed with
Rosalyn. And I'll see you here same
time next Tuesday.
(they shake)

FRANK
Thank you, doctor.
46.

Cathy listens on, beaming with pleasure.

BOWMAN
Mr. Whitaker.
(leaning out toward Cathy)
Mrs. Whitaker!

CATHY
Thank you, doctor!

Frank walks right past her. Cathy turns to catch up with him.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Cathy joins Frank in the paneled elevator. The door closes as
a soft stir of music begins. Cathy looks over at Frank who
stares ahead, blankly.

CATHY
Frank.

FRANK
What?

CATHY

I'm just proud of you, that's all.

FRANK
Don't say that.

CATHY
Well I am. And he seems like a very
decent man, Dr. Bowman. Don't you
think?

He doesn't answer.

CATHY
Frank?

FRANK
I don't know, Cathleen. I suppose
he's decent.

The elevator doors open and Frank stalks through the lobby
and out the door, music thickening. Cathy follows.

EXT. MEDICAL BUILDING - DAY

Frank and Cathy walk out of the building into a strong wind.
Behind them an obscure, REAR-PROJECTED Hartford feels a
million miles away.

CATHY
But Frank, you must have liked him
enough to want to see him again.

FRANK
Who else am I going see?

CATHY
Well - I'm sure there are numerous
doctors - in Hartford or in
Springfield - if you don't - if you
aren't certain about -
He stops sharply and turns to her.
FRANK
Look! I just want to get the whole
fucking thing over with! Can you
understand that?!
Cathy stares at him in shock and fear.
CATHY
(eyes filling)
Frank! Please don't -
Frank takes her hand. Suddenly his eyes fill as well.

FRANK
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

He embraces her.

FRANK
Cathy, I'm so sorry.

The music opens up.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MAGNAVOX OFFICES - MORNING

We pull out from a large, framed version of the Mr.& Mrs.
Magnavox ad, to a view of the whole bustling floor

The elevator doors open and we follow Frank as he walks down
the central aisle toward his office.

He nods to the regular cycle of greetings ('Good morning, Mr.
Whitaker... Morning, sir'). He approaches Kitty's desk.

KITTY
Good morning, Mr. Whitaker.

FRANK
(a bit faintly)
Kitty.

KITTY
I hope you have a pleasant day,
sir.

FRANK
(glancing back vaguely)
Thank you.
He continues on to his office.

There, he discovers Marlene standing at her desk holding a
broken desk lamp.

MARLENE

Good morning, Mr. Whitaker.
FRANK

Marlene.
MARLENE

I found this in the cupboard, sir.

FRANK
What's that?

MARLENE
Your desk lamp. Sir. The one that
was missing.
Frank lingers a moment, absently.

FRANK
Ah.

MARLENE
Should I have it repaired, sir?

FRANK
Yes. Yes -

Thank you, Marlene.

MARLENE
Uh - Mr. Whitaker, Mr. Fine's been -

The door closes behind him.

INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - MORNING
Frank stands a moment facing the door in silence.

Frank turns around to see Stan seated on a leather couch by
the window.

FRANK
Didn't see you there!

STAN
(slight beat)
Everything alright?

FRANK

(brushing it off)
Oh...

Frank sits down at his desk as Stan gets up, holding a large
flat folder.

FRANK
What's up.

STAN
Just picked up the galleys from the
printer.

FRANK
How do they look?

STAN
Great. Just great.

FRANK
Fine. Fine.
(flipping through his
appointment book)
Why'n't you leave ‘em here and I'll

get.

STAN
(slightly perplexed)
Sure.

Stan walks over to the desk and sets down the folder.

STAN
You'll... let me know what you
think?

FRANK
Course I will. You're first on my
list.

STAN

(before leaving)
So what's it gonna take to get you
back on that course, anyway? We
haven't seen you for weeks!

FRANK
I know it. I've just been...
STAN
Sunday. No excuses.
FRANK
Alright.
STAN

I'm holding you to it!

Stan leaves Frank alone at his desk. Staring straight ahead,
he reaches down to the bottom drawer and pulls out the bottle
of Scotch. He unscrews the top, closes his eyes and takes a
long, dark swig, music rising.

It's a cold, overcast day in the quiet, tree-lined
neighborhood of the Blue Hills district, as Cathy and Eleanor
emerge from the house carrying serving trays. Cathy's car is
parked in the driveway of Eleanor's modern Ranch-style home.

CATHY
Thanks again, El.

ELEANOR
You sure that's all I can give you?

CATHY
Oh, yes. The caterers should have
everything. I just thought a few
extras would be nice.

They approach Cathy's car.

ELEANOR
Oh - And don't forget! The art
show's Saturday so start working on
Frank tonight.

Cathy opens the car door and starts putting the trays inside.

CATHY
I swear he's the kind of man you
have to pin messages to!

ELEANOR
Though I'm sorry to say Mona Lauder
will be attending. Turns out her
uncle's in town, some hot-shot art-
dealer from New York. I think I met
him at one of Mona's soiree's. A
bit flowery for my tastes.

 

CATHY
How do you mean?

ELEANOR
Oh, you know. A touch light on his
feet?

CATHY

You mean...
52.

ELEANOR
Yes, darling. One of those. of
course I could be mistaken. Just an
impression I got.

CATHY
You don't care for them
particularly?

ELEANOR
Well, no, not particularly. Not
that I actually know any. Call me
old-fashioned, I just like all the
men I'm around to be all men. Say!
Why the third degree?

CATHY
It's not the third degree, I just -
(climbing into her car)
I'm interested, that's all. In your
views.

Eleanor doesn't look convinced.

CATHY
I read an article recently. Ina
magazine.
(she closes the car door)
- What?
ELEANOR

Nothing! I'm just delighted to see
you taking interest in yet another
civic cause! I can see it now:
"Cathleen Whitaker and her kindness
to Homosexuals'!

CATHY
Oh - that word.

Cathy begins pulling out.

ELEANOR
See you Sunday. And bring Frank!

Afternoon shadows stretch across the Whitaker’s block as
Cathy turns the corner. She pulls into the driveway just as
Frank is getting out of his car and David, dressed in his
baseball uniform, and Janice, in ballet clothes, come running
to greet him.

JANICE
Father’s home! Father’s home!

FRANK
Well look who’s here. The little
ballerina herself.

DAVID
Hi-ya, pop!
FRANK
(to David)

Whaduya say, kiddo?
Cathy steps out of her car just as Sybil appears to meet her

CATHY
What a lovely surprise, having you
home at a decent hour. Thank you
Sybil.

FRANK
Marlene had me set for another
dinner meeting but I just said to
reschedule.

CATHY
Oh, Frank. I’m so pleased you did.

They embrace and Frank kisses her as the whole family follows
Sybil into the house.

INT. WHITAKER DINING ROOM - EVENING

The Whitaker family are in the midst of a spirited dinner,
though it's clear all the enthusiasm in the room has begun to
drain Frank of his.

DAVID
Then Billy Hutchison stole a pass
at the ten yard line, pop. Ran it
all the way for a touch down. You
shoulda seen it!
54.

JANICE
Father, wanna see my routine for
the ballet recital?

DAVID
I was talking to pop!

CATHY
Children. Give your father a moment
to eat his dinner.
(to Frank)
Another lambchop, dear?

FRANK
I'm fine.

CATHY
You sure? I have plenty in the
oven.

FRANK

I'm fine. Thank you.
Small silence.

DAVID
We're playing Lincoln on Saturday,
pop. If you're not working.

CATHY
Oh heavens, that reminds me!
Darling, this Saturday is that
reception I told you about, for the
modern art show Eleanor's group was
sponsoring. You remember?

FRANK
Oh God.

CATHY
I know how you hate these things
but I simply have to go and Eleanor
pleaded with me to ask you.

DAVID
What about me! No one cares one bit
what I'm doing Saturday! Like
playing one of the toughest teams
in the whole entire league!
55.

CATHY
David I'm sorry but this one
Saturday your mother has an
engagement that simply can't be
changed -

DAVID
Pop could come.

Cathy looks at Frank who is looking down.

DAVID
Couldn't you, pop?

CATHY
We'll see, David.

No one talks for several seconds.
CATHY
Janice, would you please pass the
butter?
Janice passes the butter to her mother.

INT. WHITAKER BEDROOM - LATER

Frank watches TV from bed. Cathy sits at her vanity doing a
hundred strokes, looking over at him while brushing.

CATHY
Frank?

FRANK
Hmm.

CATHY

(brief silence)
Did you see him?

FRANK
Yea.

CATHY
When?

FRANK

Yesterday.
56.

CATHY
You didn't say a word.

He continues staring at the TV.

CATHY
So how was it? With Bowman? Did you
feel -

FRANK
It's fine.

CATHY
(putting down the brush
coaxing)
And there's nothing more you care
to share with your very own adoring
wife?

FRANK
Cathleen, what I discuss with this
doctor. It's private. That's - part
of it. Alright? I'm sorry.

CATHY
I understand, dear. I do.

Cathy looks at him a moment before lifting up the brush and
turning back to the mirror.

CATHY
Oh and Frank, wait'll you see the
hors d'oeuvres! The caterers are
doing such a marvelous job. I think
you're going to be very pleased
this year, darling. I really do.

EXT. HARTFORD CENTER FOR THE ARTS - DAY

A frolic of music rises as we survey a busy corner within the
Hartford cultural district

A small bustle of ladies and their husbands are milling
around the entrance to a spacious, private gallery. The
easled sign in the front window reads:

- HARTFORD LADIES AUXILIARY PRESENTS -
20 PRINTS BY THE MASTERS OF MODERN ART
WORKS BY PICASSO, CHIGAL & OTHERS
57.

Finally, Cathy comes running up to the door of the gallery.

INT. GALLERY - DAY

Cathy squeezes past clusters of visitors holding glasses of
wine when she spots Eleanor standing in front of a large
Christmas tree. Eleanor is chatting with MONA LAUDER, an
imposing, chinless brunette (fortyish), and MR. FARNSWORTH
Mona’s uncle, a rotund middle-aged man with died ginger hair
and a waxed mustache.

CATHY
Eleanor - darling! I’m so sorry I’m
late.
MONA
Cathleen!
CATHY
Hello Mona.
MONA

Darling, I want to introduce you to
my uncle, Morris Farnsworth, a
wickedly successful Gotham art
dealer who was kind enough to
attend our provincial little
gathering. Morris darling, allow me
to introduce my dear little friend
Cathleen Whitaker - whose face and
civic fancies are hardly strangers
to the society pages of Hartford!

CATHY
Oh Mona, really. You must ignore
her, Mr. Farnsworth.

Mr. Farnsworth extends his hand.

FARNSWORTH
(rather affected)
Charmed.
CATHY

I hope you enjoy your stay.

MONA
Morris was just telling us the most
delightful tale. All about a forged
Rembrandt!
58.

FARNSWORTH
Well there's really not much more
to it than that. You can only
imagine my utter disdain in
discovering the gifts of so
masterful an impersonator in as
base and uncivilized a character as
the man ultimately convicted of the
crime.

MONA
It's fascinating, isn't it?

ELEANOR
Cathy, darling, don't let us keep
you. I know you want to see the
show.

CATHY
I am dying to see it.

MONA
Oh yes. It's simply charming.
Eleanor you should be so proud.

ELEANOR
Why thank you, Mona.

CATHY
Lovely meeting you, Mr. Farnsworth.

FARNSWORTH
Likewise, my dear.

Cathy throws Eleanor a little smile as she starts off into
the gallery.

MOMENTS LATER
Cathy stands in front of a beautiful Picasso ‘crying woman'.
Suddenly - FLASH! - Cathy turns to see
Mrs. Leacock standing beside her photographer.
MRS. LEACOCK
Pardon me, dear, but it was too
lovely to resist: Wife of Hartford
Executive Communing With Picasso!
CATHY

Mrs. Leacock. Lovely to see you
again.
59.

MRS. LEACOCK
And how is that charming husband of
yours?

CATHY
He's very well, thank you -

Cathy stops suddenly, spotting someone across the room.

Raymond is standing with his daughter SARAH (age 11), leaning
over her and discussing one of the pictures on the wall. (Not
surprisingly, they're the only black faces in the room.)

CATHY
Mrs. Leacock, would you excuse me a
moment?

MRS. LEACOCK
Certainly, dear.

Cathy smiles and starts over to Raymond and his little girl
as Mrs. Leacock and the photographer observe.

Raymond looks up and sees Cathy approaching. He smiles and
stands.

RAYMOND
Mrs. Whitaker! Hello!

CATHY
Raymond. What a tremendous surprise
- finding you here. Is this your
daughter?

RAYMOND
Yep. This is Sarah. Sarah, this is
Mrs. Whitaker. Mrs. Whitaker owns
one of the gardens I look after

CATHY
Hello, Sarah.

SARAH
Hello.

RAYMOND
(spotting something out
front)
Say, Sarah, isn't that Hutch and
his little brother I see, playing
out front?
60.

Raymond directs Sarah's attention to the front of the gallery
where Billy Hutchison. (HUTCH, age 11) and two other white
boys can be seen through the glass, playing with paper
airplanes.

RAYMOND
You remember them, don't you, baby?

Sarah shakes her head, sullenly.
RAYMOND

Sure you do. The day we went to
Mrs. Hutchison's house.

SARAH
(softly)
Oh, yea.
RAYMOND

What do you say about going out and
seeing if they'd like to play for a
little while? How does that sound?

Sarah looks at her father. It's clear it's the very last
thing she wants to do, but is too shy to say anything in
front of Cathy.

RAYMOND
Aww, there's nothing to be afraid
of.

SARAH
(softly)
I know...

RAYMOND
It's only polite to say hello to
people you've met in the past. Ah,
go on, give it a try. For daddy.

Sarah looks down, turns slowly and starts reluctantly toward
the front of the gallery.

RAYMOND
Attagirl!

CATHY
Oh Raymond, she’s lovely.

RAYMOND
Thank you.
61.

CATHY
And how wonderful of you to expose
her - to art and culture this way.

RAYMOND
Well, my mother, she was always
trying to expose my brothers and I
to the finer things, and we fought
her every step of the way. I guess
I’m sort of making up for bad
behavior.

CATHY
But how on earth did you hear about
this show?

RAYMOND
Well I do read the papers.

CATHY
Well of course you do. I just meant
- it was such a coincidence.

RAYMOND
I know. I was just teasing you.

CATHY
(slightly lower voice)
Because you know I’m not
prejudiced.

Raymond smiles at her.

CATHY
(quite serious)
My husband and I have always
believed in equal right for the
Negro, and support the NACP.

RAYMOND
Well I’m glad to hear that.

CATHY
I just - I wanted you to know.

RAYMOND
Well thank you.

CATHY
Not at all.
62.

As they start into the final room of the gallery we see Sarah
through the window outside, watching as the boys try
unsuccessfully to launch their paper airplane.

EXT. GALLERY - DAY

Close on Hutch's paper airplane as his friend, Tommy, gives
it a throw.

HUTCH
Go!

The plane nosedives and Hutch goes to get it.
HUTCH
Straighter, Tommy! You gotta throw
it straighter. And hard! One, two,
three - GO!
Tommy throws it hard but it sputters down once again.
Sarah giggles to herself.

SARAH
It's too heavy!

The boys stop and turn.

HUTCH
What?

SARAH
On the end. Your airplane!

HUTCH
Who asked you?! C’mon, Bobby.

Hutch motions to the others and the boys start back into the
gallery.
INT. GALLERY - DAY

Hutch and his brother return to their parents as Sarah
watches from outside, alone.

MEANWHILE

Cathy and Raymond are looking at a Miro.
63.

RAYMOND
So what is your opinion on modern
art?

CATHY

It's hard to put into words really.
I just know what I care for and

what I" don't. Like this - I'm not
sure how you pronounce it - Mirra?

RAYMOND
Miro.

CATHY
Miro. I don't know why but I just
adore it. The feeling it gives. I
know that sounds terribly vague.

RAYMOND
No. It actually confirms something
I've always wondered about modern
art, abstract art.

CATHY
What is that?

RAYMOND

That perhaps it's just picking up
where religious art left off. You
know. Trying to somehow show you
divinity, put it up there on the
wall. The modern artist just pares
it down to the most basic elements
of shape and color. But when you
look at that Miro, you feel it just
the same.

CATHY
Why that's lovely, Raymond.

We hear the brief shriek of a woman's laugh. Cathy turns to

Mona Lauder, Mr. Farnsworth and two other women, one stifling
her giggles, snickering amongst themselves over Cathy and her

Eleanor, who is standing listening to an ELDERLY WOMAN, also
notices the commotion.

ELDERLY WOMAN
To tell you the truth, I was rather
shocked by the prices.

(MORE)
64.

ELDERLY WOMAN(cont 'd)
But then I've always preferred the
work of the masters... Rembrandt,
Michelangelo -

Eleanor spots Cathy saying goodbye to Raymond and starting
off down the hall.

ELEANOR
I'm terribly sorry - Would you
excuse me a moment?

ELDERLY WOMAN
Certainly.

Eleanor starts after Cathy.

ELEANOR
Cathleen!

CATHY
El, honey. It all looks just
marvelous -

Eleanor whisks Cathy to the side.

ELEANOR
Cathy, who on earth was that man?
You have the whole place ina
clamor!

CATHY
Oh for heavens sake, why? Because
of that ridiculous story?

ELEANOR
(squinting off at Raymond)
Who is he?

Raymond is now introducing Sarah to a smiling, middle-aged
woman in a hat.

CATHY
His name's Raymond Deagan. He's
Otis Deagan's son.

ELEANOR
Your gardener?

CATHY
Yes. He passed away very recently
and Raymond's taken over his
business.
65.

ELEANOR
Well you certainly seem on familiar
terms with the man.

CATHY
Oh what does that mean? Familiar
terms? He happens to have some very
enlightening views on Miro.
(glancing at her watch)
Oh, jeepers, would you look at the
time! El, I have to fly.

 

They start walking toward the door.

CATHY
I'm having the carpets cleaned for
tomorrow.
ELEANOR
What time are the caterers showing?
CATHY
They said four.
ELEANOR
I'll come early too. For moral
support!
CATHY

You're a doll.
Cathy waves bye and dashes out of the gallery.
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - DUSK

Music accompanies a slow and stately ascent upon the Whitaker
house, trimmed with cars and bursting from inside with the
exuberance of the annual company party. We can even hear the
distant clamor of merriment and laughter churning from
within.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK

The house, impeccably decorated, is swarming with people in
evening dress, drinking, smoking, chatting, laughing. An
overstuffed Christmas tree glistens in the corner as an
endless parade of hors d'oeuvres are passed solemnly by the
all-black, formally uniformed, serving staff.
66.

Cathy shimmers in a gown of sapphire blue, standing
surrounded at one end of the room, while Frank stands with
drink in hand, surrounded at the other.

We see various faces from the Magnavox office, including
Marlene. Cathy is listening to a middle-aged Elderly Woman.

ELDERLY WOMAN
Not to say that I'm against
integration mind you. I do believe
it's the Christian thing to. But I
still say what happened in Little
Rock could just as easily have
happened here in Hartford.

A stout, red-faced man answers.

RED-FACED MAN
Nonsense!

ELDERLY WOMAN
And why is that?

RED-FACED MAN
Well for one thing, there's no
Governor Faubus in Connecticut. But
the main reason - They're no
Negroes!
(laughs)

Two of the serving staff close enough to have heard his
remark continue serving.

DICK DAWSON, a tall, strapping man in his mid-30's, is
leaning on a chair beside Cathy.

DICK
No, but I do hear there are some
rather dangerous pro-integration
types. Right here in Hartford!

ELDERLY WOMAN
Dangerous?

DICK
Oh yes. Some very attractive ones
in fact. Noted, I'm told, for their
kindness to Negroes!

CATHY
(slapping his arm)
Oh Dick, stop! Where on earth did
you hear about that?
67.

DICK
Shirley read it to me.

CATHY
I should have known.

RED-FACED MAN
What's all this?

CATHY
Absolutely nothing! Here, let me
freshen those.

Cathy takes Dick and the red-faced man's glasses and starts
off toward the bar. Frank is at the couch with Stan Fine,
Doreen and her husband RON. As Cathy passes, Stan calls out
to her.

STAN
By golly there she is now!
Prettiest gal in the room!

CATHY
Oh, Stan! Liquor does bring out the
Texan in you. I just hope Eleanor
isn't listening.

STAN
(putting an arm around
her)
So what if she is! I still say
Frank's the luckiest guy in town.

RON
Here, here!

Frank is hunched over listening, noticeably intoxicated.

FRANK
(thinking he's being
witty)
Smoke and mirrors, fellas! That's
all it is. You should see her
without her face on!

Frank laughs at his own joke and a few join in awkwardly.

DOREEN
Erank!
68.

CATHY
No, he's absolutely right. We
ladies are never really what we
appear. And every girl has her
secrets!

DOREEN
I'll say.

FRANK
(thrusting his glass at
her)
Well how ‘bout this girl going and
getting her husband another drink?
How ‘bout that?

CATHY
(still smiling)
You don't think you might have -
already had enough, darling?

FRANK
No, I don't think I've already had -
DOREEN
(interrupting, raising her
glass)

Well I'd just like to take a moment
to raise a glass to our marvelous
host and hostess and another
glorious Annual Party at the
Whitaker's! To Frank and Cathy,
truly Mr. and Mrs. Magnavox!

Everyone around them raises their glasses ‘To Frank and
Cathy’ and toasts. Cathy and Frank smile and nod at their
guests, but the strain is evident

CATHY
Thank you... Now who can I freshen
up? Ron?
RON
I'm fine.
STAN
Me.
CATHY

I think you're fresh enough.

Cathy starts off toward the bar. Sybil is crossing with a
tray.

Eleanor puts a hand on Cathy's back as they start back into
the party.

ELEANOR
By the way, kid. I think we just
threw ourselves one class-A swanky
function.

CATHY
It did turn nicely, didn't it.

A WOMAN calls out to Cathy.
WOMAN
Cathleen, darling. You've simply
outdone yourself - once again!

DISSOLVE TO:

WHITAKER LIVING ROOM - LATER

Cathy stands at the door waving goodbye to the last guests
(probably Eleanor & Stan)

CATHY
Thanks for everything! I'll call
you tomorrow! Goodnight!

Cathy closes the door and steps into the half-darkened house,
still strewn with party debris. She takes a deep breath of
relief, and notices Eleanor's serving-ware by the bar.

CATHY
Oh, shoot - I forgot to give
Eleanor her servers.
Frank sits in an armchair, rouged in shadow.
Cathy walks toward the stairs and stops, looking at him.

CATHY
Frank?

He doesn't respond, and she continues on toward the stairs.

CATHY
Well, if I do say so myself, I
think it was a very lovely party,
all considering.

She stops to gather her wrap at the foot of the stairs. She
looks off a moment, very still.
71.

CATHY

(quiet and level)
I just don't understand. Why it has
to turn ugly. In front of our
friends.

(silence)
Honestly, Frank. If you didn't
insist on -

She stops, hearing something, and turns - Frank is suddenly
approaching.

CATHY
What is it - ?

But all at once he’s upon her - rolling into her arms and
kissing the side of her neck, music rushing. Cathy is
stunned, but gradually begins returning his affection.

CATHY
Oh Frank...

They fold into the couch, kissing, and suddenly Frank is on
top of her. At first she’s unsettled by his strong urgency
but she allows it to continue, stroking his head and trying
to slow him down. But he becomes only more persistent
panting and thrusting and turning red from the effort. Cathy
closes her eyes and tries to weather it. Then with a sudden
half-choked cry, Frank surrenders, turning away from her and
muttering aloud in exhaustion and defeat

FRANK
Oh Jesus! Jesus, what’s happening!
I can’t even... Oh God!

CATHY

Frank! Frank, it doesn’t matter,
darling! The important thing is to
keep... trying. Keep -

FRANK
(sitting up suddenly, his
back to her)
Don’t -

CATHY
Frank!

She puts her hand on his shoulder but he shakes it off.

FRANK
Don’t.

72.

FRANK(cont 'd)
Because I’m sure - you know - Dick
Dawson wouldn’t mind... lending his
services every now and again!

CATHY
Oh, Frank.

She reaches for his arm again and he tries to wriggle free,
but she holds on.

FRANK
I mean, you wouldn't mind that so
terribly much, would you? Good-
lookin’ guy like Dick. Maybe even
Stan would pitch in!

CATHY
(holding tighter)
Frank, please. You're the only man

I'd ever -
FRANK
Let go!
CATHY
You're all men to me, Frank! And
all man!
FRANK
STOPPIT!

Furiously he swipes her hand away and accidentally strikes,
her hard in the face with his cufflink.

CATHY
(covering her face)
Oh, Frank!

FRANK
I'm sorry. Cathy, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to -

Cathy grabs a cloth napkin from the coffee table and presses
it to her head.

CATHY
It's alright. I'm alright. It was
an accident.

FRANK
Is it bleeding?

CATHY
Just the littlest bit.
73.

FRANK
Oh, Jesus.

Frank just stands there, helpless.

CATHY
Perhaps you could get me a little
ice, dear.
FRANK
Ice?
CATHY
Yes.
FRANK
Cathy, I'm...
CATHY
I know, dear. It's alright. I'm
alright.

Frank slowly backs away, toward the kitchen, music expanding.
Cathy just closes her eyes.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WHITAKER BEDROOM - LATE MORNING

Cathy stands before the mirror in her bedroom vanity brushing
her hair over the small wound on her forehead. She puts down
the brush, takes one last look and starts out of her room.
INT. LANDING - LATE MORNING

As Cathy passes an upstairs window she sees Eleanor's car
just pulling up to the house. Cathy takes a breath and starts
down the stairs.

EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE DOORWAY - LATE MORNING

Eleanor is just ringing the doorbell when Cathy opens the
door, holding her friend's serving-ware.

CATHY
Hi.
74.

ELEANOR
Hey there, honey. Listen, I can't
stay. I'm meeting Stan for lunch at
the club.

CATHY
That sounds nice. I can't believe I
let you get away last night without
these.

ELEANOR
It's cute, your hair that way.

CATHY
Yea? I experimented. Here.

ELEANOR
It's adorable.

As Cathy hands the servers to Eleanor a serving spoon falls
out.

ELEANOR
Whoopsie!

Cathy picks it up from the ground and puts its back in the
dish.

ELEANOR
Thanks.

Eleanor smiles at Cathy. Suddenly she stops smiling.

ELEANOR
Cathy?

Cathy's hair no longer conceals the bruise on her forehead.

CATHY
What?

ELEANOR
What happened to your head?

Cathy's hand flies up to cover it
CATHY
Nothing, I - hit the door. It was
the silliest thing.

Eleanor continues staring with concern.
75.

ELEANOR
Cathy.

CATHY
What.

ELEANOR

Did something happen - between you
and Frank?

CATHY
What do you mean?

ELEANOR
Cathy I'm your best friend.

CATHY
Nothing happened. Nothing at all.

ELEANOR
Oh, Cathy.

CATHY
(suddenly quivery)
Eleanor!

ELEANOR
(looking hard at her)
Cathy I'm your dearest and closest
friend in the world. You can call
me. Day or night. You hear?

Cathy nods.

Eleanor remains looking, worriedly at her friend. Then she
sighs and turns to go.

Cathy watches, unable to move. She can't contain it any
longer and starts after - but stops herself again.

Eleanor is climbing into her car. She shuts the door.

Cathy turns around facing her house, eyes flooding, as we
hear Eleanor driving off. Not ready to go back in, she
proceeds down the steps to the side of the house, under a
tree.

There in the shade she takes a few short breaths, trying to
gather herself. She begins to focus on something on the
ground in front of her.

It's a pair of black boots.
76.

Raymond stands a couple yards away watching, not knowing what

to do.

She sees him and the tears spill from her eyes.

RAYMOND
Oh - Mrs. Whitaker...

He takes a step toward her and stops.

RAYMOND
Is there - anything I can do?

She shakes her head no, wiping the tears and trying to shield

her forehead from view.

RAYMOND
You sure?

CATHY
Thank you, no. I'm fine, really.
It's just - been a difficult time.
With my husband.

RAYMOND
It does happen. Between married
people.

CATHY

I know it does. I just...
(she turns away)

It's so embarrassing. Please

forgive me.

RAYMOND
Forgive you for what?

He looks off for a moment, then back at Cathy.

RAYMOND
Mrs. Whitaker, listen. I have to go
deliver some shrubs to a farmhouse
just out of town. Which means I
have to get a move on. why don't
you come on along for the ride?
Little fresh air, change of
scenery? Might help take your mind
off things.

Cathy feels a sudden guard.
77.

CATHY
No. I couldn't. But thank you
Raymond. For offering. That's very
kind of you.

RAYMOND
You sure?

SYBIL
(off)
Mrs. Whitaker? Are you out here?

Cathy turns, calling out toward the porch.

CATHY
Yes, Sybil!

SYBIL
(off)
It's Mrs. Barker on the phone!

CATHY
Thank you, Sybil! I'll be right in!
(back to Raymond)
I should get back.

RAYMOND
Okay.

She turns to leave. From Raymond's view beneath the tree we
can see her legs striding back to the porch and up the steps
into the house.

INT. WHITAKER'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Cathy walks over to the table by the window and picks up the
phone.

CATHY
Hello?... Yes. How are you, Mrs
Barker... Not at all...

As Cathy talks she steps over toward her vanity and glances
at herself in the mirror. She adjusts her hair so that it
covers her forehead as before.

CATHY
Yes, I was planning to pick them up
at five... I see. So you'd like to

switch for Thursday? No, I don't
think that would be a problem...
(MORE)
78.

CATHY(cont 'd)

Well I'm glad I could be of help...
Certainly... Bye now.

Cathy steps back to the table and hangs up the phone, still
for a moment. She glances out the window into the yard.

Raymond can be seen throwing his toolbag over his shoulder
and setting off for the day.

Cathy remains looking out, in thought.

EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Raymond is just shutting the door of his truck when Mrs.
Whitaker comes walking briskly from the house. She is wearing
her coat and her lilac scarf.

CATHY
Raymond!

Raymond turns, sees her coming.

RAYMOND
Mrs. Whitaker...

Cathy stops a couple of yards from his truck, feeling
suddenly rather awkward.

CATHY
Hi.

RAYMOND
Hello.

CATHY

Well, wouldn't you know it. I just
received a call and suddenly
everything's changed. Anyway. I
just...

She's doesn't even know what to say.

RAYMOND
You changed your mind?

Cathy smiles, shyly.
RAYMOND

Well good!

Raymond opens his door and gets out.

Through the living room window, Sybil catches sight of
Raymond helping Cathy into his truck. She stops what she's
doing a moment as

Raymond's truck takes off down the street, music swirling.

We see Raymond's truck driving down a road flanked by golden
hills. He turns up the drive of an old ranch house, and
drives up to the top.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. RANCH HOUSE - A BIT LATER

A large, rustic ranch-house sits on a bluff overlooking the
late-Autumn vista of faded gold. Raymond's truck is parked in
front of the house where Raymond stands with the ranch owner
signing a receipt. Cathy has begun strolling past the house
toward a clearing in the trees.

[Throughout the following exteriors REAR-PROJECTED facsimiles

Raymond shakes hands with the ranch-owner and starts over to
where Cathy stands, looking out. On the way he breaks off a
branch from a tree with white bark and round, golden yellow
leaves which he presents to her.

CATHY
It's lovely. What is it?

RAYMOND
It's called a Quaking Aspen. Fairly
rare in these parts.

CATHY
(admiring the branch)
It's beautiful.
(looking out at the vista)
And you were right. What a
perfectly lovely spot.
80.

RAYMOND
Sometimes a little green, some
fresh air, just helps put things
back on the shelf. ‘Cause it sure
can be a disheveling world out
there, every now and again.

CATHY
I'll say it can.

Cathy looks over toward a clearing in the grove.

CATHY
Is that a path?

RAYMOND
Looks like it.

CATHY
Oh let's have a peek.

RAYMOND
Alright.

They start off down the path, Cathy leading, music
burgeoning.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WOODED TRAIL - LATER

Cathy and Raymond stroll down the gently winding path, red
carpeted by the last of autumn while cloaked in an early
winter mist.

As they stroll they are each aware of the diminished
formalities between them.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WOODED TRAIL - LATER
They come upon a cluster of wildflowers.

RAYMOND
So you say he’s seeing a
specialist?

CATHY
Yes, well... A psychiatrist
really.

(MORE)
81.

CATHY(cont 'd)
My husband’s been suffering froma
great deal of strain, recently.
Uncertainty.

RAYMOND
I’m sorry.

CATHY
I know he’s in good hands - It’s
just... what with everything that’s
been going on recently, it just - I
don’t know - feels at times like
there’s no one left in the world I
can talk to!

Cathy smiles to herself and looks back at him.

CATHY
(lightly)
Except you!

Raymond smiles.

RAYMOND
Well. Sometimes it's the people
outside our world we confide in
best.

CATHY
Why? Just because they're outside?

RAYMOND
And because they may have had
experiences similar to ours.
Because they care to listen.

CATHY
And once you do. Confide. Share
those experiences with someone.
They're no longer really outside,
are they?

They've come upon a small wooden bridge under which a perfect
stream passes. They stop for a moment.

CATHY
It's lovely, isn't it?

She kneels down and looks into the stream.

Raymond is looking down at her. There's a sadness in his eye,
and he squats down beside her, music waking.
82.

RAYMOND
(with great gentleness)
Did he cause that?

He is looking at the mark on her forehead.
Cathy puts her hand over it and stands, silent for a moment

CATHY
He didn't mean to strike me.

She looks down at the stream and takes a step away.

RAYMOND
I'm sorry.

CATHY
No. Heaven knows we all have our
troubles. I'm sure you yourself...

RAYMOND
What?

CATHY
Oh, I don't know. Ever since
running into you at the
exhibition... Well I just kept
wondering what it must be like.
Being the only one in a room.
Colored, or whatever it was. How
that might possibly feel. I'm sure
I've never -

She stops, glancing out again at the hills.
Raymond looks out as well.

RAYMOND
Well, I suppose it's something you
sort of grow accustomed to. Over
time. Don't get me wrong. There is
a world - even right here in
Hartford - where everybody does
indeed look like me. Only trouble
is, very few people ever leave that
world. I just want what any father
wants for his child, the
opportunities growing up I never
had.

CATHY
Naturally.
83.

RAYMOND
But I'll tell you something - If
you're really interested -

CATHY
Oh I am.

RAYMOND
(has a sudden thought)
Are you hungry? Could you eat
something?

CATHY
(brief silence)
I suppose I could.

RAYMOND
Tell you what. Let me take you to
one my favorite spots, not far from
here. On good days they got hot
food, cold drink, and just about
discernible music.

CATHY
Well it's hard to beat that!

RAYMOND
(smiling)
There you go!
Cathy smiles back as they start back up the path.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ERNIE'S BAR & GRILL - LATE AFTERNOON

Against the gray, industrial side of town, gleams the pink
and green neon of Ernie's Bar&Grill. We see Raymond's truck
just pulling into the driveway.

EXT. CAR WASH - LATE AFTERNOON
Across the street at a Car Wash, a young black attendant
gives two short honks from a shiny black Edsel and looks

around.

A woman in a black feathered hat approaches. It's Mona
Lauder.

MONA
Here I am! Yoo-hoo?
84.

The attendant takes her ticket and escorts her to the
driver's seat but Mona tarries a moment, catching sight of
something across the street. The attendant looks off in the
same direction.

Outside Ernie's, Raymond is seen helping Cathy out of his
truck, taking her arm and escorting her into the club.

Mona remains devilishly fixed as she steps into the car and
the attendant shuts the door.

MONA
(handing him a nickel)
Thank you... very much, indeed.

Mona starts her engine with a contented little smirk.

INT. ERNIE'S - LATE AFTERNOON

The front door opens and Cathy and Raymond step into the
entry way of the club.

CATHY
(fixing her hair)
Well I'm hardly dressed for a
restaurant.

RAYMOND
You look fine.

The main room at Ernie's is a smoky den of small square
tables and black booths, colored mostly by neon overspill and
Christmas lights. Most notably, everyone in the room is
black.

As Raymond and Cathy enter everyone in sight turns and looks.

CATHY
Raymond.

Raymond contains a little smile.

RAYMOND
Don't worry. It's a very friendly
place.

Raymond starts in and Cathy follows, reluctantly. A small
blues band is just setting up as an old jukebox plays and one
couple dances.
85.

Raymond passes ESTHER, a dolled-up waitress in her late 20's
who scowls at him as he stops, glancing around the room for a
table.

RAYMOND
Say there Esther, darling. what?
You don't say hello any more?

ESTHER
(checking out Cathy)
Looks like you’re speakin’ fine for
yourself.

RAYMOND
Oh, you’re just sore ‘cause I
haven’t been coming around like I
used to.

ESTHER
Is that so?

RAYMOND
Now what do you say about bringing
us over a couple of drinks.
(to Cathy)
What would you like?

CATHY
Oh. A daiquiri? If they -

RAYMOND
One daiquiri, and a bourbon on the
rocks. Thank you, doll.

Esther rolls her eyes and turns.

As Raymond escorts Cathy to a table, a GLARING MAN stands up
from his table just as Raymond is passing.

GLARING MAN
(to Raymond)
What d'you think you're doing, boy?

Raymond passes him without looking, continuing with Cathy to
a corner table below a mirror and helps Cathy into her chair
He sits down opposite her.

The glaring man stares after a moment, then takes off
adamantly toward the bar.
86.

CATHY
(a little tense)
Well I hope you find this very
amusing.

RAYMOND
What do you mean? It's a very
welcoming place!
(spotting someone and
nodding)
How you doin’ Gus.

A middle-aged man at another table (looking fairly soused)
raises his glass to Raymond, then to Cathy.

Cathy smiles back at him.

RAYMOND
See what I mean?

Cathy watches as a second couple step up to the dance-floor.
Meanwhile Esther returns with drinks and menus.

CATHY
Thank you.

RAYMOND
Thank you, Esther.

She leaves.

RAYMOND
(raising his glass)
Well. Here's to being the only one.

Cathy looks at him a moment and then smiles, shaking her
head. She toasts his glass and he laughs.

RAYMOND
Really. We don't have to stay if
you're not comfortable.

CATHY
No. As long I keep away from
Esther, I think I'll be fine.

RAYMOND
Alright, then.

The jukebox song has ended and the band kicks into its first
number, a tender “I’1l Be Seeing You.” Raymond turns to
watch, smiling.
87.

A few men in blue-collar uniforms are sauntering out of a
smoke-filled pool-room, beer bottles in hand. They also stop
to listen to the band, while two more couples head up to the
floor to dance.

Cathy looks over at Raymond, and smiles to herself.

CATHY
Thank you, Raymond.

He turns to her.

CATHY
For a lovely afternoon.

RAYMOND
Well thank you, Mrs. Whitaker. I’ve
had one as well.

CATHY
‘Mrs. Whitaker.’ Sounds so formal.
Would you -
She stops.
RAYMOND
(gently)
Would I what?
Brief silence.

CATHY
Ask me to dance?

Raymond smiles and slowly stands.

Cathy does the same and turns, leading as Raymond follows
unhurriedly to the dance-floor.

The men in blue-collar uniforms watch Raymond pass with

contempt in their eyes, before finally turning and filing out
of the bar.

Cathy stops beneath a blossom of rosy light and turns
smiling as Raymond joins her. She takes his hand and they
begin to dance, tenderly, in the soft glow of Ernie's
surrounded by other dancers and other lovers.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE UP ON:
88.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE MORNING

We follow a vase displaying the golden Quaking Aspen branch
as Sybil carries it into the living room. Cathy is gathering
her belongings, getting ready to leave the house.

CATHY
Oh, doesn't that look lovely. Let's
see now, where should we put it...?
How about there, Sybil, by the
window?

Sybil places the vase on a high end-table near the window.

CATHY
Oh yes, that's lovely.

SYBIL
It certainly is.

CATHY
(checking her purse)
Now where is that list you gave me -
Though I swore to Janice I wouldn't
be late for her recital.

SYBIL
You can't miss that.

CATHY
(finding the list)
Here it is.
(walking over to her coat)
You know, Sybil, I've been meaning
to ask you...

SYBIL
Yes, ma’am?

CATHY
What is the name of that church
group you belong to - the one
you've mentioned so often...?

SYBIL
You mean at Ebenezer? The bible
group?

CATHY

(putting on her coat)
Yes, I believe that was it.
89.

SYBIL
Or was it South Green Baptist.
During the Fair Drive. The ladies
auxiliary?

CATHY
I didn't realize there was more
than one.

SYBIL
Oh, yes. I always seem to be
signing up for something.

CATHY

Well I think that's marvelous
Sybil. That you even find the time,
what with all you do for us.

(putting on her scarf)
We just have so much up in the
attic I've been meaning to go
through. I thought you might know
of a church or civic group that
could benefit from a donation.

SYBIL
Well - certainly, Mrs. Whitaker. If
that's what you're looking for.
Places in need are never too hard
to find.

CATHY
(opening the door)
Well I suppose you're right about
that -

Cathy stops with a start.

A young black couple are standing in the doorway.

CATHY
Yes? May I - help you with
something?

Sybil looks on suspiciously, observing the couple's
conservative attire and officious clipboards.

YOUNG MAN
Is this the Whitaker residence?

CATHY
Yes.
90.

YOUNG MAN
Are you -
(glancing at a clipboard)
Mrs. Frank Whitaker?

CATHY
Yes.

YOUNG MAN

(reciting his standard

introduction)
Good afternoon, ma’am. Allow me to
introduce myself. My name's
Reginald Carter and this is Martha
Livingston and we're members of the
Hartford branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People. As a charitable
organization we rely heavily on the
aid of volunteers and membership
revenue from the general public.
Perhaps you'd be interested in
reading over our complimentary
brochure which explains more about
the N-A-A-C-P, its many
achievements and goals for the

future.

CATHY
Well - certainly, I'm familiar with
your organization - I just... May I

ask how you obtained our name and
this address?

YOUNG MAN

You gave it to us ma’am.
CATHY

I did?
YOUNG MAN

When you signed our petition
supporting the funding initiative.

CATHY
(thinks for a moment,
then)
Oh. Yes, I do remember signing for
that.
YOUNG MAN

Perhaps you'd be interested in
reading over our complimentary -
91.

CATHY
Yes, I would -

YOUNG MAN
If you wouldn't mind signing
our roster?
CATHY
Perhaps - Sybil, would you mind
signing for this? I'm terribly late
at it is.

Sybil, who has tried busying herself at the hall table, looks
up, just as the phone starts to ring.

CATHY
(starting out the door)
Whoever it is I'm gone! Thank you,
Sybil - I should be back by five!
SYBIL
(stepping to the door)
Yes, ma'am.
As Cathy scurries off the three look after, music hanging.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CAR - DAY

Cathy drives down Hawthorne street looking out her window
eagerly, music stirring softly.

The red-and-green Christmas decorations on the lamp-posts
only seem to accentuate the greyness of the neighborhood.

Then she spots it.

A small storefront with Christmas trees out front reads
DEAGAN GARDEN SHOP.

She smiles to herself as she continues on, picking up speed.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HARTFORD STREET - DAY

A wind whistles through downtown Hartford as Cathy hurries
out of the local Stop-&-Shop carrying groceries. She smiles
at a WOMAN passing on the street, and hurries on to her car
92.

The woman stops and turns, looking back at Cathy as she goes.
Two ladies are passing down the street - the same two ladies
who stood snickering with Mona and her uncle at the art show.
One of them spots Cathy and whispers something to the other.

Cathy notices, stopping a moment before shutting the trunk of
her car, then rushes on.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DANCE SCHOOL - LATER

Cathy dashes in the front door of the building where a sign
is posted. It reads: BALLET RECITAL TODAY

INT. DANCE SCHOOL - LATER

Inside the dimly-lit recital room mothers sit in rows of
folding chairs watching as a class of 10 and 11-year-old
girls perform a routine.

Cathy steps into the main room, hushed in attention, and
stops to watch. Janice comes running over.

JANICE
Mother!

A ballet instructor turns and shh's them.
CATHY
(whispering)
Hello, dear.

Janice embraces her and then turns to face the recital,
curling around her mother and keeping hold of her hand.

CATHY
Did the recital just begin?

Janice nods.
CATHY
So where are the other little girls
from your class?

JANICE
Over there.

A queer fog of music forms as Cathy looks over to the other
side of the room.
93.

All the other girls Janice's age are standing with their
mothers at the opposite end of the room.

The mothers all seem to be looking over at Cathy (or
pretending not to) while clutching their daughter's hands or
pulling them close. And all the little girls are quiet,
staring sleepily at their estranged classmate and her
silently tainted-mother.

Music spills over

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WHITAKER HOUSE - LATER AFTERNOON

We MOVE IN from a slow distance, angled toward the garage, as
Cathy follows Janice up the porch steps into the house.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WHITAKER LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

The front door opens and Cathy and Janice enter the house,
dank with late afternoon.

CATHY
Sybil, we're home!

There's no answer. Suddenly Janice goes running into the
house and straight up the stairs. The phone starts to ring.

CATHY
Janice? Janice?

Cathy watches her go. The phone continues ringing and Cathy
sighs, putting down her purse and scarf and starting into the
kitchen.
CATHY
Sybil?
INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Cathy enters the kitchen, lit only by the late-day sun. There
is no sign of Sybil as she goes to answer the phone.

CATHY
Hello?
94.

ELEANOR
(through receiver)
Cathy!
CATHY
El?

INT. FINE'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
Eleanor crouches on the phone, pane shadows lining her face.

ELEANOR
Oh Cathy, thank heavens you're
home. I've been trying you all day.

INT. WHITAKER KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

CATHY
El, what is it?

ELEANOR
(through receiver)
So you haven't heard. You haven't
heard a thing?

CATHY
No - About what? Eleanor, what
happened?

INT. FINE BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

ELEANOR
Oh Cathy, there's been talk.
Vicious talk.

CATHY
(through receiver)
What do you mean? About what?

ELEANOR
About you!

CATHY
(through receiver)
Oh, for heaven's sake - What now?

ELEANOR
Oh, honey, I wish you never even
had to know.

(MORE)
95.

ELEANOR(cont'd)
It's Mona, Cathy, she's - well,
she's just been on some kind of
rampage, swearing up and down she
saw you and a colored man,
somewhere out on Franklin, coming
out of a truck or some such thing -

INT. WHITAKER'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
Cathy closes her eyes.

ELEANOR
(cont'd through receiver)
The same colored man, she claims
you were talking to at the art
show!

CATHY
But that's - that's preposterous! I
mean yes I've spoken to Mr. Deagan
on occasion. But this makes it
sound like -

ELEANOR
(through receiver)
Cathy, believe me, I've been at my
wits end. You have no idea what
it's been like around here - the
phone's been ringing off the hook
since eight this morning!

CATHY
But Eleanor - the entire thing - is
so absurd!

ELEANOR

(through receiver)
Darling, I know.

CATHY
But what in the world can I do?

ELEANOR
(through receiver)
Well. I suppose you could start by
getting yourself another gardener.

Cathy suddenly turns.

Frank is standing in the shadows off the kitchen, looking
down.
96.

CATHY
Frank! What on earth - I didn't
even hear you -
(to Eleanor)
Eleanor, Frank just walked in. Can
I call you back?

ELEANOR
(through receiver)
Of course. You go ahead.

CATHY
I'll call you later.

Cathy hangs up the phone.
CATHY
Frank, what are you doing home? Is
everything alright - ?

He starts toward her, out of the dark, a drink in his hand.

FRANK

Just tell me one goddamn thing.
CATHY

What?
FRANK

Is it true? What they're saying?

CATHY
Oh, Frank, I can't believe you even

FRANK
Because if it is, even the
slightest bit, so help me God,
Cathleen -

CATHY
Frank I'm sorry you ever even had
to hear of such nonsense!

FRANK
Yea', well, Dick Dawson didn't seem
to think it was such nonsense when
he snuck away from his desk today
to phone me -

CATHY
Good heavens -
Silence.

97.

FRANK
He says the whole friggin' town's
been talking!

CATHY
Frank, Sybil will hear you.
FRANK
I sent her out. - Christ, Cathleen!

Do you even have the slightest idea
what this means? Do you realize the
kind of effect this could have on
me and the reputation I've spent
the past eight years of my life
trying to build? For you and the
children and the company?

CATHY
Frank, I swear to you, whatever
Mona Lauder saw or thought she saw
was entirely a figment of that
woman's hateful imagination! Yes.
I'd spoken with Raymond Deagan on
certain occasions - he brought his
little girl to Eleanor's art show!
But evidently, even here in
Hartford, the idea of a white woman
even speaking to a colored man is
more than any -

FRANK
Please! Spare me the Negro rights!

CATHY
Frank, you know what that woman is
capable of. Besides I - I've
already given him notice. We won't
be seeing the man again.

FRANK
Fine.

CATHY
Is that why you're home? Because of
what Dick said?

Frank just looks down at his drink, jiggling the glass.

CATHY
Frank?
98.

He looks up at her with a little smirk, downs the rest of his
drink, and walks out of the kitchen toward the bar

CATHY
What, Frank.
(she follows)
Did something happen at work?

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank is at the bar refilling his drink when Cathy
approaches. She stops and looks at him.

CATHY
Frank?

FRANK
I guess you could call it sort of
an early Christmas bonus.

CATHY
What do mean?

Frank takes his drink over to the couches and flops into it

FRANK
A month of rest and relaxation'!
Can you imagine? During the busiest
season of the year?! I mean what a
goddamn honor!! But I guess when
you consider the bang-up job I've
been doing, ever since good ole Dr.
Bowman entered the scene! And for
being, as Millstein put it - what? -
"years overdo'! -

CATHY
But Frank you do deserve a
vacation, after all you've given
them.

FRANK
Well, Palm Springs is supposed to
be nice, says the word from on
high.

CATHY
Frank, I know it might not seem it
now, but with everything that's
happened, a trip somewhere, away
from it all...

(MORE)
99.

CATHY(cont 'd)

Frank, it might just be the best
thing in the world. For both of us.

He just looks down.

CATHY
Oh, Frank. What a wretched day it
must have been for you, darling -

All at once the front door bursts open and David rushes in.
Cathy stands up.

DAVID
Say! What do you know, pop's home!
What're you doing home, pop?

Cathy approaches David, gathering up her purse and scarf and
starting up the stairs.

CATHY
Your father has work to do, David.
It's best you help yourself to a
glass of milk and get started
straightaway on your studies.

DAVID
Yes, mother. Say, pop -

FRANK
Mind your mother, David.

DAVID

Yes, sir.
INT. BEDROOM - LATE DAY
Cathy closes the bedroom door behind her and stops. A low
tremor of music rises as the late day sun filters through
curtains a peach and purple fume. Cathy walks slowly toward
the window and stops, looking out
Dusk has cast an early freeze over the Whitaker yard.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DEAGAN GARDEN SHOP - EARLY EVENING

Raymond stands outside his shop in the opaline dusk, showing
a Christmas tree to a middle-aged man. JAKE, a teenage
employee, steps out from inside.
100.

JAKE
Say, Mr. Deagan!
RAYMOND
Yes, Jake?
JAKE
There's a lady on the phone for
you.
RAYMOND

I’1l be right there.

(to the customer )
Would you excuse me a moment? I’m
terribly sorry.

INT. GARDEN SHOP - EARLY EVENING

Raymond picks up a wall-phone near the front door, as
Christmas colors bleed through the Garden Shop windows behind
him.

RAYMOND
Yes? This is Raymond Deagan.

It’s Cathy, and Raymond can’t conceal his pleasure.

RAYMOND
Oh, hello... That’s right. Is
everything - ?
(he listens)
Yea. I think I could... Alright...
I’1l see you tomorrow then.

He hangs up the phone but remains a moment, music bridging.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. KELLER’S DRUG-STORE - DOWNTOWN HARTFORD - DAY

Through the large, Christmas-trimmed windows of Keller’s Drug-
store we see Cathy, wearing sunglasses and scarf, crossing
the street.

Raymond waits at the corner of the old-fashioned, seasonally
adorned establishment, moderately busy for the middle of the
day. The door opens and Cathy walks directly over, stopping
beside him.

RAYMOND
Hello.
101.

CATHY
Hello.
(silence)
Thank you for meeting me. I realize
you have a busy schedule.

RAYMOND
Worked out fine. I was glad you
called.

He turns to her with a smile, but Cathy darts a glance to the
counter where

Two women are glaring and whispering.

RAYMOND
You sure everything's alright?

Cathy exhales, closing her eyes. She shakes her head.

RAYMOND
What is it?

The SODA JERK has been watching them from the other end of
the counter.

SODA JERK
Uh - Is there something I can do
for you folks?
CATHY
(quietly)
Can we leave here?

RAYMOND
Of course.

Raymond quickly escorts Cathy, head ducked into her collar,
out to the street.

SODA JERK
Maybe that isn't such a bad idea!

Several customers turn and glare as they go.

EXT. KELLER'S DRUG STORE - DAY

Raymond and Cathy are turning down the first corner.
102.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - LATER

The 20's-style movie theater stands across the street
streaked in winter light. The marquee reads HILDA CRANE and
THE BOLD AND THE BRAVE.

Cathy and Raymond cross over to the theater and stop under
its awning.

Cathy looks down.

RAYMOND
What is it? What happened?

CATHY
I wanted to see you in person
Raymond. I just - I can't -
(she stops)

RAYMOND
Can't what?

CATHY
It just isn't plausible, Raymond,
for me to be friends with you.

Raymond tenses.

CATHY
You've been so very kind. To me.
And I've been perfectly reckless
and foolish in return... thinking -

RAYMOND
What? That one person could reach
out to another? Take an interest in
another? And that maybe, for one
fleeting instant, could manage to
see beyond the surface - beyond the
color of things?

Cathy sighs and thinks a moment

CATHY
Do you think we ever really do? See
beyond those things? The surface of
things?
103.

RAYMOND
‘Just beyond the fall from
grace/Behold that ever shining
place.’ Yes, I do. I don’t really
have a choice.
CATHY
(softly)
I wish I could.
She takes his hand, a bit formally.

CATHY
Good luck to you, Raymond.

She starts to turn away to leave when Raymond grabs her arm.

RAYMOND
Mrs. Whitaker!

A passing couple with a stroller turn and stop.
Schoolgirls waiting to buy tickets do the same.
CATHY
(still softly)
Raymond - please don't -

A TALL MAN in shirt-sleeves and suspenders shouts from across
the street.

TALL MAN
You! Boy! Hands off!

Raymond turns.

TALL MAN
Yea, you!

Cathy puts her hand over Raymond's and gently removes it. She
takes a step back.

Raymond stands helplessly, everyone watching.

CATHY
Oh Raymond -

He looks at her with such sadness.
CATHY

(as much to herself)
You're so beautiful.
104.

She mouths ‘bye’ and turns, starting off briskly down the
street.

Spectators break into murmurs.

The tall man across the street slowly turns and continues on
his way.

Raymond looks back in Cathy's direction as she disappears
around the corner.

Music booms, sweeping us inexorably forward.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. JUNIOR LEAGUE FOOTBALL FIELD - AFTERNOON

It's a brisk winter day and light flurries are just starting
to sprinkle up the sky. David's junior-football team has
broken and he and the others are walking back from the field.
Along the sidewalk a row of black school-kids in uniform are
making their way down the street.

One of the children is Sarah Deagan, Raymond's daughter, who
is walking with another little girl her age.

SARAH'S FRIEND
Which' is how come I almost fell
asleep during Math-class, on
account of my brother playin’ his
records all night long - until my
mama came and made him switch it
off. And I don't even like that
type of music!

Sarah's attention has turned to a powder blue Chevrolet
slowing down near the football field. It's Cathy's car, who
Sarah recognizes as it comes to a stop. She watches as David,
walking back with his friend Hutch, calls out to his mother
in the car.

DAVID
Mother! Can I sleep over at Hutch's
tonight? Please!

CATHY
Not tonight, David. Your father's
home and we're having a family
dinner.

SARAH'S FRIEND
Who's that?
105.

SARAH
Oh, just some friends of my daddy.
You don't have to wait, I'll catch

up.

Sarah's friend continues on as Sarah remains for a moment
watching.

DAVID
You never let me stay over

CATHY
Next time, David, I promise. Now
please get in the car, I'm late as
it is.

David climbs into the back-seat - Janice is seated in front -
and the car begins to pull out.

Sarah smiles as it approaches. But as she lifts her hand to
wave hello only Janice seems to notice her - whisking past
the window as they go.

Sarah watches as the car speeds off down the road. She looks
back in the direction of her group, but now her classmates
are a good block away. And the snow has begun picking up. So
she plunges her hands in her pockets and starts up after
them.

Up ahead where the block narrows, Hutch and two of his
friends stand leaning against the fence, sharing a cigarette.

Sarah notices them ahead.

Hutch is the first one to spot her, and he stares hard as she
approaches. A chill of music is felt as Hutch leans over and
starts whispering to the others. As they look back at her and
laugh the music picks up a jazzy beat.

Sarah approaches, tucking her head down sullenly.

HUTCH
Hey fellas, look who's comin'! It's
daddy's girl! Hey there daddy's
girl! Where do think you're going?

SARAH
(a mumble)
Home.

HUTCH
Home to see your daddy?... Yea, and
his white girl?
106.

Suddenly Sarah tears off, running down the street, music
turning fast and brassy. The boys exchange brief smiles
before grabbing rocks from the ground and taking off after
her.

HUTCH
Hey! Where ya goin’? We just want
to play!

Sarah looks back as she runs and sees them following. She
starts to panic but continues running, dropping her
schoolbooks along the way.

She comes to a busy intersection and turns off into an alley.

EXT. ALLEY -AFTERNOON

Sarah tears around a trash dumpster only to discover that the
alley doesn't go through. She turns around just as Hutch and
the others arrive, sealing her off, music simmering. The snow
falls steadily now.

HUTCH
Uh-oh! Wrong turn, daddy's girl!

2ND BOY
Hey daddy's girl! Over here!

With their stone-wielding arms in the air, the boys begin
slowly tightening around her, music building. Sarah begins
backstepping toward the wall.

HUTCH
Yep! She made a wrong turn alright!

He doubles back with his rock, pitcher style, as the music
explodes into wild rhythm, and the other two follow.

HUTCH
Just like her daddy!

All at once their rocks go hurling at Sarah, with Hutch's
coming last and hard and hitting her in the head. It knocks
her back and she falls to the ground.

For a split-second the boys are frozen. Then all at once they
take off down the street, music reaching a brassy, frantic
peak.

RAPID FADE TO BLACK.

INT. WHITAKER LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS DAY

Music shimmers suddenly as the top of an unwrapped present is
lifted, revealing amid a blossom of tissue a satiny pair of
new ballet slippers. We ascend.

JANICE
Oh, it is them, it is! Oh thank

you, mother! Thank you, father!

Kaleidoscopic light multicolors the rosy, Christmas-strewn
living room as Janice scurries over to Frank on the couch and
Cathy returns with an egg nog. David sits on the rug, pooling
over his new electric train-set. Outside, the backyard
glistens with snow.

CATHY
Merry Christmas, darling!

JANICE
Now I'll be as good as all the
other girls in class.

CATHY
(handing him his drink)
There you are, darling. Just the
way you like it.

DAVID
(holding up one of the
cars)
Pop! Look at the steam engine!

FRANK
Wonderful!

CATHY
Well, look at that.
(walking over to the
fireplace)
I knew I was forgetting something!

Cathy returns with Frank's Christmas stocking.
CATHY
There you are, darling! A little
something for Mr. and Mrs. Clause!

Frank overturns the stocking and a handful of travel
brochures slip out onto the table.
FRANK
What 've we got here? Acapulco,
Miami, Palm Springs, Bermuda.

Cathy sits down beside him on the arm of the couch.

CATHY
Take your pick, darling. It's your
choice.

FRANK

This mean you're paying?

CATHY
Well Rio, I know, is a bit
extravagant, but the rest are
really all quite affordable. As far
as warm weather goes. This time of
year.

FRANK
I don't know. Stan's always raving
about Miami.

CATHY
Oh, Frank I think Miami would be a
dream! El says it's just darling.
Everything's pink.

FRANK
Oh yea?
(tiny pause)
Then maybe we oughta consider
Bermuda.

Cathy looks at him.

Frank cracks a little smile. Music sweeps up as Cathy

embraces him.

CATHY
Oh, Frank! I do love you, darling.
I do.

EXT. MIAMI RESORT - NEW YEAR'S EVE NIGHT

Music can be heard spilling out from the glittering supper-
club, jutting off the side of the modern, palm-lined resort
109.

EXT./INT. TERRACE - RESORT SUPPER-CLUB NIGHT

Cathy and Frank dance together on the terrace of the
sparkling venue, all decked out for New Year's, under the
stars. A small band is playing and several other couples are
dancing. And though it's not without tension it's clear they
are each trying to make the vacation as pleasant as can be.

CATHY
I must say you look extremely
fetching all gussied up in your
white tux and tie.

FRANK
Well it's a good thing, since I can
hardly breath in it.

CATHY
Oh it's not that bad.
(silence)
You like my dress?
FRANK
Yes. Very much. Didn't I say?
CATHY
You did not.
FRANK

Well it's a ravishing dress. And a
ravishing girl to go with it.

CATHY
That's more like it.

The song ends and everyone claps for the band. Frank kisses
Cathy tenderly on the lips, under the stars, and she smiles
into his eyes. Frank puts his arm around her gently and
escorts her back to their table.

As they near their table they are intercepted by a large
family being seated. The handsome middle-aged parents sit
down first, followed by five blond, handsome children

ranging from late teens to late 20's in age. The BLOND FATHER
addresses Frank and Cathy:

BLOND FATHER
Excuse us.

FRANK
No problem at all.
110.

One of the middle sons, the prettiest, watches Frank closely
as he passes.

Cathy doesn't notice. But Frank does.

FRANK
You have a lovely family.

BLOND FATHER
Thank you. Happy New Year.

FRANK
Happy New Year to you.

Frank nods to the table, catching another glimpse of the
pretty blond boy's stare. And he and Cathy take their seats.

CATHY
Frank, do you remember that summer?
At your uncle's in Vermont? Janice
wasn't even born yet. When David
broke his finger on the water pump?

FRANK
(remembering)
Oh yea.
CATHY

Whatever happened to that house?

FRANK
Think Margaret eventually put it on
the market.

CATHY
That was a wonderful old place. All
those wonderful barbeques.

FRANK
It was a good summer -
(distracted by the noise)

CATHY
It must be almost time.

Cathy lifts her glass and Frank refills it, then refills his
own. He glances over toward the ruckus from other tables.

The blond table is awash in champagne and the pretty son now
fully absorbed in the festivities.

From the bandstand, the M.C. leads the room in a rousing
countdown.
111.

EVERYONE
... Five - four - three - two - one
- HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!

 

 

Cathy and Frank toast their champagne and kiss through the
rain of pale blue confetti and all the shimmering cheer
surrounding them.

CATHY
Happy New Year, darling!

FRANK
Happy New Year, dear

Music swirls.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. POOLSIDE - MIAMI HOTEL - DAY

We are surveying a pleasing aqua-blue scene of pleasure-goers
by the pool. A girl with a pink bathing cap swan-dives into
the sparkling water, which is littered with swimmers and
children frolicking by the steps.

Frank is just finishing some laps and stops at the shallow
end to catch his breath. He sits down on a step, still half-
submerged, and smiles at the mothers of the splashing
toddlers. He notices something at the other end of the pool.

A few members of the blond family are just coming out

dressed in swimwear and robes. They grab a few lounges and
chairs and start to settle. The pretty son doesn't seem to be
among them.

Frank stands, stretches. He steps out of the water and
reaches for his towel just as a small black boy, age 4 or 5,
goes skipping past him into the first step of the pool.

His father, a HOTEL WAITER, is running over from the hut-
style snack-bar.

HOTEL WAITER
(calling out)
Martin! Martin, get outa there! You
know you're not allowed in there!

Cathy, who sits among a row of lounges under an umbrella,
looks up from her magazine.

A woman with a baby is already stepping efficiently out of
the pool while others stand, dumbstruck.
112.

Everyone else in the water, save one man doing laps, just
stares at the tiny intruder. Instantly the waiter arrives and
yanks his son out of the water.

HOTEL WAITER
(forcefully)
Now what did I tell you about going
in that pool?! You know you're not
allowed in there!

He carries his crying boy off.

Frank turns toward Cathy and shrugs. He starts back, drying
himself off on the way.

CATHY
Hello, there.

FRANK
Well hello.

Frank plops himself down on the lounge, flat on his back, and
exhales.

CATHY
Mmmm. Good swim, darling?
FRANK
(eyes closed, nodding)
Mmm.
CATHY
Feel good?
FRANK
Mmm.
CATHY

Isn't the sun just marvelous?

But her expression changes when she glances back toward the
pool.

Kids who were playing now stare across the pool to the
shallow end blankly. The last few bathers near the steps are
just stepping out of the water, leaving the entire area
cleared.

A MOTHER in an unbecoming swimsuit calls out to her DAUGHTER.

MOTHER
Donna?
113.

DAUGHTER
What?

MOTHER
Time to get out.

DAUGHTER
But why?

MOTHER

(sharply)

Because I said so.

The daughter starts swimming reluctantly to the edge, just as
the man doing laps makes his final pass.

We see the girl in the pink swimming cap climbing up the
small ladder in the deep end. Within moments the pool is
completely empty.

Frank and Cathy observe in silence.

Before turning back, Frank takes a final glance at the blond
family gathering.

The pretty son has just arrived, wearing a white terry-cloth
robe and a beach bag over his shoulder. He doesn't notice
Frank.

We hear Cathy slap shut her magazine.

CATHY
Well that does it.

Frank turns.

CATHY
I think I've heard quite enough
about fashion and advice for one
afternoon! I do believe it's time
for my Miss Mitchell.

Cathy opens up her canvas bag but doesn't see her book.

CATHY
Oh, heavens.

FRANK
What?

CATHY

I must have left it in the room. So
silly.
114.

FRANK
You want me to go?

CATHY
No, darling. You just sat down.

FRANK
I don't mind.
(he sits up)

CATHY
What? No, Frank. I’ll go.

Frank stands up and flexes.

FRANK
It’s fine. I want to get a paper
anyway.

CATHY
You sure?

FRANK
Yea.

He grabs his shirt and room-key and starts off toward the
room - in the opposite direction of the blond boy by the
pool.

CATHY
Thank you, darling. I’m sure it’s
just there on the night-stand.
INT. FRANK’S ROOM - DAY
Frank has left the door ajar as he gathers his wallet and
Cathy’s book. He stops for a second in front of the mirror
and regards himself in his wear. Not bad, for a man his age.

Then suddenly he senses something. A hum of music hangs in
the air as he turns his head to the gap in the door.

There, standing and staring at Frank, is the blond boy. He
holds his robe in one hand, revealing a lithe, white body
squeezed into pale orange swim-trunks.

Frank stares back, captive.

The boy’s fingers are quietly grazing his crotch.
115.

Slowly, like a sleepwalker, Frank begins to approach, music

deepening.

FADE TO BLACK.

WE HEAR
JANICE

They're here! I see their car!
They're here!

INT. WHITAKER LIVING ROOM - EVENING

FADE UP ON:

Music lightens as David, Janice and Sybil all hurry to the
door which flies open on Cathy and Frank, armored with gifts

and luggage.

JANICE
Mother! Father!
DAVID
Hi-ya pop! Hey mother!
SYBIL
Welcome home, Mr. And Mrs.
Whitaker.
CATHY
Well look at you all! what a lovely
greeting!
JANICE
So mother was it dreamy?
CATHY
Listen to you! Dreamy!
SYBIL
(taking Mr. Whitaker's
suitcase)
Did you have a nice time Mr.
Whitaker?
FRANK

Yes, Sybil. It was very relaxing.

DAVID
Say, pop!
116.

CATHY
David, help Sybil with the luggage.

Frank sits down on the living room sofa as Sybil starts up
the stairs with a suitcase.

DAVID
Pop, you'll never guess what
happened at school this week? Try
and guess!

FRANK
I give up.

CATHY
David!

JANICE*
(lugging a suitcase up the
stairs)
I'm helping, mother!

DAVID
Billy Hutchison and these two other
boys all got expelled from school!

FRANK
You mean suspended.

Sybil is starting back down the stairs.
DAVID

No! Expelled! I swear! For throwing
a rock at a girl's head.

CATHY
That's terrible. A little girl from
school?

DAVID

No. She was a Negro.

CATHY
What? Who told you such a thing?

DAVID
Tommy Hawkings. He saw. So he had
to tell the principal.

Cathy glances up at Sybil who continues slowly down the
stairs.
117.

CATHY
Sybil? Is this true?

Sybil glances over to Frank and back to Cathy.

SYBIL
Yes, ma'am. I'm afraid it is.

Cathy looks over at Frank incredulously.

CATHY
What in heaven's name has gotten
into this town?

FRANK
It's just a couple of foolish kids.

DAVID
Hutch said they were just trying to
teach her a lesson.

Sybil continues on into the kitchen.

CATHY
Well I think it's dreadful. And
you're certainly not to see that
Hutch boy again. You understand me?

DAVID
Yes, ma’am.

FRANK
While you're there David, how about
flipping on the set for your old
man.

DAVID
Sure, pop.

Cathy sighs, picking up the mail from the hall table, and
starts upstairs.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cathy enters the dark room, flips on the light and puts down
her things. She walks over to the small desk by the window

and puts down the mail.

There, among the bills, she notices the NAACP brochure. She
picks it up.

Close on brochure, music taking.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WHITAKER DINING ROOM - LATE DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER

Cathy’s finger is scanning the telephone book for a listing
and comes to rest on a number for the NAACP Information Line.
Then she lifts the receiver off the phone and starts dialing.

She is sitting at the dining room table, half-toned by a bath
of wintery light, while Janice sits at the coffee table doing
her homework.

JANICE
Mother, how do you spell ‘skirt’?
CATHY
One minute, dear. Mother’s making a
call.
(she finishes dialing and
waits)

Yes - hello. I was wondering if you
could help me possibly. I just
recently received your brochure -
which I found extremely informative
- and was curious to learn a little
more about what was entailed
precisely - in your volunteer
program - in terms of particular
skills and so on. You see I -
what?... Yes, I can hold.

Cathy hears the front door opening and turns.

Frank is walking in the door wearing a snow-dusted coat and
hat, looking beat.

JANICE
Father’s home!

CATHY
(complete surprise)
Erank? What happened to the match?

Tiny smile.
FRANK

Oh, my shoulder’s been acting up. I
couldn’t sit there any longer.
119.

CATHY
You didn’t say anything.

He starts taking off his coat and mittens by the coat-rack.

JANICE
Father, I did the splits today.
Wanna see?

CATHY
(hanging up the phone)
Janice, your father just walked in
the door. And you have schoolwork
to finish.

JANICE
Yes, mother.

CATHY
You know, Frank. You never had that
physical. I certainly think you're
due for one, dear. Can I call Dr
Ellis? It's been three years
Frank.

Frank doesn't answer as he walks over to the couch and sits
down with the TV guide.

CATHY
You know my brothers had physicals
every year on their birthday, all
during school. Father insisted.

He doesn't respond.

CATHY
Did I tell you the pediatrician
thinks Janice is going to need
braces?

JANICE
Father, do I have to!

CATHY
Apparently our little girl has an
over -bite.

David rushes in from the backyard carrying a bucket and rags.
DAVID

Say, pop! You'll never guess what
I'm doing?
120.

CATHY
David, where is your coat?

DAVID
In the garage.

CATHY
And what's it doing there?

DAVID
I’m waxin’ pop’s car! It’s gonna
look swell, pop.

CATHY
David! How many times do I have to
tell you children - you are not
permitted outdoors in this kind of
weather if you're not properly
dressed. It’s ten below zero
outside, they're expecting
flurries! Do you understand me?
David?

DAVID
Yes ma’am.

CATHY
Because I give up. If you children
want to go and catch your death of
cold then so be it. I mean you try
talking sense to them, Frank
because nothing I say ever seems to-

All of the sudden Frank bursts into tears.

CATHY
Frank!

Janice and David are stunned, staring at their father

CATHY
Frank! What's the matter - !

She gets up from her chair and starts over to him, a dark
mist of music forming.

FRANK
Oh - God!

Janice begins to cry.
121.

CATHY
(urgently)
Janice. David. Go upstairs to your

rooms.
Janice stands, sobbing. David remains, transfixed.

CATHY
Now!

Janice runs up the stairs and David follows in a trance.
Cathy stands frozen near the foot of the stairs.
FRANK
(crying)
Oh - Cathy...

She approaches him but slowly, with a strange foreboding.

CATHY
What, Frank. What is it?

FRANK
Something happened...

CATHY
What?
(nothing)
What.

 

Frank cries almost like a baby.

FRANK
I’ve fallen in love with someone.

Cathy stares.

FRANK
Who wants to be with me.

For a moment, just having said it sobers him some, and he
looks back at her. Then he crumbles again.

FRANK
Oh Cathy, I think I might have to
go!

Music deepens as Cathy numbs, staring flatly, unable to move.
122.

FRANK
I just - I never knew... what it
was like - I know how cruel that's
sounds. But I'm not... - Oh God,

Cathy. I tried! I tried so hard to
make it go away... I thought I
could do it... for you and the
children... But I can't! I
can't!...

He buries his head in his hands.
After several seconds she responds.

CATHY
(lifeless)
I assume then... you'll be wanting
a divorce?

Frank looks up at her, puffy-eyed. But suddenly the tears
seem to have stopped.

Cathy looks back at him like a stone.

FRANK
(softly)
Cathy I’m so sorry.

But all at once she turns, and picking up a glass from the
table walks straight-headed up the stairs.

INT. BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

Cathy enters, closes the door and stands frozen, in the dark
for several seconds.

INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING

We look down at Frank who stands alone in the empty living
room. He turns and walks over to the bar and limply pours
himself a drink. He stands frozen a moment, drink in hand, as
music gathers, softly. Then he throws it back, walks over to
his coat and hat and opens the front door of the house. He
turns back around for one last look - and closes the door
behind him.

INT. BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

Cathy stands outside her door looking out the landing window.
She hears the sound of Frank’s car starting off.
123.

Filtered through a new snowfall, the red of his brakes tint
the dusky sky and rouge her silent profile. Music deepens.

Cathy walks to the window and stares hard at the telephone.
She lifts the receiver to her ear. She dials.

Music opens as we

INT. FINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Eleanor reaches for Cathy's hands, music settling.

ELEANOR
Oh, Cathy.

CATHY
So you see, El. You see why I
couldn't tell you anything.
Anything at all.

ELEANOR
Oh you dear, sweet kid. Ina
million years I couldn't have
imagined. Not Frank! I suppose
divorce really is the only option -
if only to keep it as far from the
children as possible.

CATHY
I think that's what's been the
hardest of all. The endless
secrecy. Our entire lives just -
shut in the dark.

ELEANOR
Are there savings?
124.

CATHY
Nothing much to speak of. And
certainly not with Frank's job on
the line.

ELEANOR
Well honey, you know, if there's
anything you need, anything at all -

CATHY

Oh, El...
ELEANOR

I mean it. We're here. Alright?
CATHY

Thank you, El. For always having

been.

Cathy reflects a moment and stands, walking toward the
window.

CATHY
You know it's funny.
ELEANOR
What's that.
CATHY

This whole time, the only person
I've been able to talk to. About
any of this.

(turning back to her)
Was Raymond Deagan.

Eleanor looks at Cathy in disbelief.

ELEANOR
What?

CATHY
It’s true. Well, not in the way
Mona intended - Nothing like that!
We would just talk! But... Somehow
it made me feel - oh, I don’t know.
Alive somewhere.

 

She glances out the window at the rain-dampened snow.

CATHY
Oh Eleanor, I know it sounds
ridiculous and mad...

But I do, I think of him. What he’s

Cathy turns back to her friend with the wistful smile of a
girl.

Eleanor glances off.

CATHY
El?

Eleanor gets up and starts tending to the tray of empty cups.

ELEANOR
What can I say? You’re so full of
surprises. I’m speechless.

Cathy looks at her.

CATHY
What do you mean?

ELEANOR
(little laugh)
Though I'm sure I must have looked
entirely the fool, crusading away
against Mona Lauder and all her so-
called inventions-!

CATHY
Eleanor! - How can you say such a
thing?

ELEANOR

I didn't say a word! who am I to
tell anyone how to lead their
lives?

CATHY
But El! Nothing happened between
us! I told you that!

ELEANOR
Cathy it's none of my business. But
you certainly make it sound as if
something had.

disarmed.

There, filtering moonlight through its gilded maze, the
branch of Silver-tip spruce still sits in a vase by the
window.
SYBIL

Mrs. Whitaker?
Cathy turns toward the kitchen.

Sybil stands in the shadows near the kitchen door.

CATHY
Sybil.
SYBIL
I'm sorry to disturb you ma'am, I
just...
CATHY
Yes, Sybil?
SYBIL

It's something I've been wanting to
tell you, ma'am, for some time -
Something I believe you'd surely
want to know - even if it isn't...
exactly my place...

CATHY
Sybil, what is it?

SYBIL
It's about the little colored girl,
ma'am. The one that got hit?

CATHY
Yes. What about her?

SYBIL
I'm sorry, ma'am, but it was Mr
Deagan's little girl, Sarah -

CATHY
What! Oh God, Sybil, it wasn't!
SYBIL
The neighbors tell me she's doing
just fine -
CATHY

Oh that dear, sweet little girl.

incensed)
How in God's name, Sybil, could you
not have told me this? That was
weeks ago - !

 

She turns and marches to the entry hall, Sybil following.

SYBIL
Oh, Mrs. Whitaker, please don't be
cross with me! I didn't want to -
makes things any worse!

CATHY

Sybil, Sybil do you have any idea
where Mr. Deagan lives?

SYBIL
I believe he's been at his father's
old place on 12th and Governor.

CATHY
12th and Governor. Thank you
Sybil.

Cathy grabs her purse and opens the door, rain falling.

SYBIL
You’re going there now?

EXT. DEAGAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Rain falls upon the inky, lamp-lit night as we loom down
slowly upon a small, wood bungalow, the front windows of
which appear to have been boarded up.

Through the window downstairs we can just glimpse Raymond
walking past.

INT. DEAGAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Raymond is bringing a freshly made cup of hot chocolate into
the living room, stirring as he goes.

RAYMOND
And here we have it! Your daddy's
super-duper world-renowned hot
cocoa specially prepared for his
super-duper number one girl!

He hands the cup to Sarah who is stretched out on the couch
with pillow and blanket watching TV. A small, square bandage
on her forehead still marks her injury.

SARAH
Thank you, daddy.
RAYMOND
How you feeling, baby?
SARAH
Fine, daddy.
RAYMOND
What's that you're watching,

anyway?

There's a knock at the door. Raymond stops.

RAYMOND
Who on earth...?

He walks to the front.

RAYMOND
Yes?

The door opens on Cathy, turning suddenly to face him.

CATHY
Raymond! Oh Raymond I just heard.
Just this instant. I heard and I
got in my car.

How are you? How's Sarah?

RAYMOND
We're fine. Thank you.

A car passes and Raymond looks out nervously.

RAYMOND

Meet me around the side.

Cathy nods and starts back down the steps as Raymond steps
back inside the house.

RAYMOND

Sarah, everything's alright, honey.
I'll just be outside for a minute.

SARAH
Okay daddy.

EXT. DEAGAN HOUSE - NIGHT

Cathy stands facing away, softly illuminated by an outdoor
lamp, along the side of Raymond's bungalow. She hears
footsteps and turns.

Raymond stands near the corner of the house, looking at her.

Oh Raymond.

closer)
What you must have been through.

Raymond looks down and shuffles forward some as well.

What's being done, to the boys

Nothing. I won't make her go

rocks coming through the window

CATHY
Raymond, that's hateful.

RAYMOND
It's not white's throwing them -
it's coloreds.

CATHY
No.

RAYMOND
Oh, yea - Seems to be the one place
where whites and coloreds are in
full harmony. Anyway, we'll be out
of here soon enough, once and for
all.

CATHY
You're moving?

RAYMOND
Yea.

CATHY
Where to?

RAYMOND

I have a...

(emptying some flooded

trash-lids)

brother in Baltimore. Says he
can find me work out there. So
we're packing up the house. Two
weeks Friday we'll be on the 4:30
train, heading South.

CATHY
But what about your business, your
shop?

RAYMOND

The business is through. No one's
gonna hire me.
(MORE)
131.

RAYMOND( cont'd)

So I'm selling the shop to a cousin
of mine. No...

(he looks off)
It's pretty well finished for me
here.

(a thought stops him)
I've never lived anywhere but

Hartford.
CATHY
(all vulnerability)
Perhaps... sometime in the
future... after you're settled - I
could... perhaps come for a visit
See Baltimore? You see I... Well it

looks as if I'm to be single again.

Raymond looks at her. It makes him sad. He smiles softly.

Silence.

RAYMOND
Oh, Mrs. Whitaker.
CATHY
(softly)
Please call me Cathy.
RAYMOND
(softly)
Cathy.
CATHY
No one would know us there.
RAYMOND
I'm just not sure... it would be
such a wise idea. After... well,

everything that’s -

Cathy looks at him, feeling the first chill of an impending

loss.

RAYMOND

All that matters now - what’s got
to matter most - is what’s right
for Sarah. I’ve learned my lesson
about mixing with other worlds. And
I’ve seen the sparks fly...

(tenderly)
All kinds.

Cathy turns away, hiding sudden tears.
132.

Raymond puts a hand on her shoulder, which she covers with
hers.

RAYMOND
Have a proud life. A splendid life.
Will you do that?

She closes her eyes.
He kisses her fingertips.

RAYMOND
Goodbye Cathy.

His fingers slip from hers.

She stands a moment, the black, liquid sky continuing its
downpour, then starts walking, hurriedly, to her car. She
doesn’t look back.

Raymond watches gravely, then turns and starts slowly back
inside.

To which a rising music as bottomless as the sea suddenly
answers, spilling over and engulfing what follows.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WHITAKER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

The curtains are drawn and Cathy lays across the shadowy
surface of her bed, sobbing. Everything she's kept inside
seems to spill from her now, as we move in gently through
aquanautic shadows.

Music fades, leaving us alone with her sounds - when the
phone starts ringing. Cathy stops, listening. Then sits up in
bed and looks over at it, wiping her eyes. Then she slips off
the edge of the bed and walks over to the writing table to
answer it. Outside, the rain appears to have stopped.

CATHY
Hello?

FRANK
(through receiver)
Cathy? Did I wake you?

CATHY
Frank?
133.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Frank sits on the phone against blue floss hotel wallpaper,
his face in shadow.

FRANK
I’m sorry to call this late. I hope
I didn’t...

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

CATHY
No. I was awake.

FRANK
(through receiver)
I didn’t want to - upset the
children.

CATHY
No. Of course.

FRANK
(through receiver)
How are they, by the way?

CATHY
Fine. Just fine. They still ask
when you'll be coming home.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

FRANK
I know. I know. I guess that's -
partly why I was calling...

Frank sits hunched-over a little table in the dark. Behind
him, spread out in bed with newspapers and a half-eaten box
of chocolates, the pretty blond boy watches a large Tv.

FRANK
I, uh - I got a call from Dick
yesterday. Said everything was...
set, papers drawn up.
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cathy just listens. Expressionless.
134.

FRANK
(through receiver)
He wanted to know... how Thursday

was for you. Three o'clock
sometime. I told him I thought you
might have carpool Thursdays but I
wasn't absolutely certain. So I
said I would check.

CATHY
(distantly)
You never could remember my carpool
days. And they've always been the
same, Wednesdays and Fridays, as
long as I can remember.

FRANK
(through receiver)
Wednesdays and Fridays. Of course.
Same old absent-minded -

CATHY
What time... did you say on
Thursday?

FRANK
(through receiver)
What?

CATHY
The appointment? What time?

FRANK
(through receiver)
Oh - Three. Three o'clock.

CATHY
(brief silence)
Alright.
FRANK

(through receiver)
Okay. Well... Great. That was it
really. I know it's late.

CATHY
It is.

FRANK
(through receiver)
So I guess I'll see you on -
Thursday, then.
135.

CATHY
See you Thursday.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

FRANK
Goodbye, Cathy.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Music rises like a steam.

CATHY
Goodbye, Frank.

She hangs up the phone and sits very still for several
seconds.

SLOW DISSOLVE:

INT. WHITAKER BEDROOM - DAY - TWO WEEKS LATER

Outside, through the bedroom window, we can see the new
gardener - an Asian man - watering the plants. We slowly move
inside to find Cathy sitting at her bedroom table finishing
up the bills.

CATHY
(writing)
Sixty-seven dollars and thirty-two
cents.
(looking up a moment)
Now what is today...?

She glances over at her desk-calendar, turning the page to
the proper day. It reads: SATURDAY, MARCH 1.

She copies the date down in her checkbook, then stops a
moment. She looks back at the calendar as if trying to
remember something. Snapping back to business, she tears out
the check, places it in an envelope and seals it. She gathers
up her other mail and stands, glancing once around the room
before grabbing her purse and sunglasses and starting out the
door.

INT. WHITAKER FOYER - DAY

The soft sunlight shimmers through windows as Cathy comes
down the stairs.
136.

Sybil is busy polishing the dining room table.

CATHY
Oh, Sybil. You don’t need to be
doing that.
SYBIL
It’s Friday.
CATHY
I know it is, but... There’s just

so much more to do now. I can
hardly expect you to be polishing
the table every week.

SYBIL
No reason not to keep things up
Mrs. Whitaker. No reason at all.

CATHY
I know.

Cathy stops in front of the mirror to fix her hair and put on
her sunglasses.

SYBIL
Don't forget the grocery list.

CATHY
Oh! Thank you, Sybil -
(she starts checking her
pockets)
I don't know how in the world I'd
ever manage - Here it is.

She takes out the shopping list but finds something else in
the pocket. She pulls out a scarf - the lilac scarf -
forgotten there since her afternoon with Raymond. Music
whispers.

She looks at it a moment, then up at the mirror where it's
reflected in her hand. She puts it on over her hair and
glasses and stops a moment, looking at herself.

CATHY
I shouldn't be long, Sybil.

SYBIL
(still bent over,
polishing)
Alright, Mrs. Whitaker.
137.

Cathy turns, music rising, and starts out the door

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

Cathy drives up in front of the large green field, stuffed
with boys in red, sauntering back to the bleachers. David is
amongst them, walking arm-in-arm with another boy, when he
spots his mother’s car and waves.

DAVID
Say - Mother!

CATHY
Go and gather your things, David.
Mother’s in a hurry!
David races his friends to the bench where he grabs his
knapsack and goes running to the car. He hops in the front
and we ascend as Cathy takes off down the street.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DANCE-SCHOOL - DAY

Cathy is walking Janice, dressed for ballet, out the door of
her dance-school.

CATHY
See you next week!

The door shuts behind them as Cathy hurries Janice into the
car. She rushes around to the driver's side, hops inside the
car, and is off again, zipping down the road.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

A soft, new sun warms the brick of the Hartford Train
Station, standing proudly in the center of town. We see
Cathy's car just pulling up and turning into the parking
section.

INT. CAR - DAY

DAVID
Say! Why are we turning in here?
138.

Cathy is pulling into a parking space.

CATHY
Mother just needs to dash inside
for two shakes while you and your
sister wait inside in the car.

DAVID
No fair!

JANICE
Where are you going?

CATHY
(getting out of the car)
I'll be right back. Now stay put.
Both of you. And lock the door.

Cathy shuts the door of the car and looks up at the clock
outside.

It reads: 4:24.
She hurries on inside.

[Music continues in some form through to the end of the film]

EXT. PLATFORM - DAY

Cathy emerges out of the stairway onto the platform, a jumble
of boarding and goodbyes. She looks back and forth anxiously,
then starts walking down the platform toward the front of the
train.

She hurries along, looking every-which-way, past all the
others.

Then suddenly she stops.

Raymond stands on the platform, gingerly helping Sarah up the
steps of the train while a black attendant loads their
luggage into an open compartment.

Cathy starts over to them, but Raymond slips inside the train
without seeing her.

Cathy just stares at the door, watching others continue
inside. Right in front of her

A heavy-set Italian man is saying goodbye to his wife and two
sons. The wife is crying.
139.

A CONDUCTOR is passing.
CONDUCTOR
All aboard! Southbound train to New
York and Washington now departing.
All aboard!
Cathy looks back at the train door just as

Raymond reappears, stepping out of the train and addressing
the young attendant, who hands him his baggage slip.

Cathy takes a few unconscious steps in his direction.
Raymond tips the attendant and shakes his hand and starts
back to the door of the train. He takes one step up and
stops, turning around again.

CONDUCTOR
All aboard! All aboard!

He sees her.

She smiles for being seen. Raymond smiles warmly back.

And suddenly - cruelly - the train begins to move. Though for
one luxurious moment it actually sweeps them together - with
Raymond gliding toward Cathy and then crossing her - before
setting off on its inexorable pull.

Cathy lifts a tiny hand goodbye.

Raymond lifts his in return.

She smiles, tears starting, as Raymond continues shrinking
from view before vanishing entirely with the snaking engine.

Suddenly everything is still.

Cathy stands for several seconds, alone in the sudden
stillness.

Then all at once she turns and begins walking away, down the
platform.

Music resumes with sad resolution.

CATHY (V.0.)
That was the day I stopped
believing in the wild ardor of
things. Perhaps in love, as well.
That kind of love.
140.

EXT. TRAIN-STATION - MOMENTS LATER

From a great height we see Cathy walking decisively out of
the station on her way back to her car, late afternoon sun
burning orange upon the town.

CATHY (V.0.)
The love in books and films. The
love that tells us to abandon our
lives and plans, all for one brief
touch of Venus.

Cathy climbs into her car, shuts the door and begins driving
out of the lot.

CATHY (V.0.)
So often we fail in that kind of
love. The world just seems too
fragile a place for it. Or perhaps
it's only we who are too fragile.

Finally Cathy is turning onto the main road, amid all the
other cars heading home. Her powder-blue Chevrolet is
engulfed.

All around, trees are starting to bloom. Spring has arrived.
