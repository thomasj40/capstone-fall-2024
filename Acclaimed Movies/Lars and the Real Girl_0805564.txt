LARS.
EXT. MIDWEST WINTER LANDSCAPE -- EARLY MORNING

The beginning of winter. Dead cold fields; pine and bare tree
woods; a highway that leads to a small town, a lake.
Beautiful in a stark winter way but very cold.

EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE

Establishing.
EXT. LARS'S GARAGE APT. -- MORNING
Establishing.
INT. LARS'S GARAGE APT. -- MORNING

Lars is dressed for church. He wears an old, hand-knitted
paby blanket like a shawl. He looks out the window, watches
smoke rise from the chimneys in the neighborhood. He watches
the family next door--husband, wife, children--in an ordinary
Sunday morning routine. His breath mists the glass.

His rooms are sterile: bed, computer, one bowl, one plate,
one cup; furniture he must have grown up with. We see a
wedding picture of his parents, a wedding picture of his
brother Gus and his sister-in-law Karin.

EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: BACKYARD -- CONTINUOUS

From the main house, KARIN, early 30's, pregnant but not
showing yet, hurries across the backyard, past a big stack of
firewood, to the garage. She’s thrown a sweater over her
bathrobe and wears slippers. She's the kind of woman who
looks good in cold weather and no make-up.

INT. LARS’S GARAGE APT.--WINTER--CONTINUOUS

Lars opens the door. He’s awkward and nervous with her, and
concerned to see her in the cold.

LARS
Karin!

KARIN
I'm inviting you for breakfast.

Lars puts his blanket around her shoulders, careful not to
touch her.

LARS
Sorry, I’m on my way to church.

(CONTINUED)
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 2.

CONTINUED:

KARIN
After church, then. Come on, we
haven’t seen you for so long.

LARS
You're going to have a baby, run
back in the house, what if you get
sick?

KARIN
Come on, please.

She reaches to touch him, he takes a little step back. It’s a
subtle, practiced move, he does it unconsciously with
everybody, most people don’t notice. But today she does.

LARS
Yes, yes, okay.

KARIN
Promise?

LARS
Promise.

He watches her run back to the house--he wants to make sure
she arrives safely. The house, to Lars, seems very far away.

INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS
Karin enters.
cus
(sleepy)
well?

Karin crawls back in bed with GUS, 40, a bigger, stronger,
warmer version of Lars.

KARIN

You owe me five dollars.
Gus

Not till he's sitting at the table.
KARIN

Something's going on with him. I'm

worried.

Gus doesn’t pay much attention. He nuzzles her.

(CONTINUED )

 
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 3.

CONTINUED:

GUS
You keep saying that. Your maternal
instincts are kicking in.

KARIN
He never lets me touch him.

GUS
Well, we're not like your family.

KARIN
What does that mean?

cus
A million brothers and sisters
fighting and hugging all the time.

KARIN

That’s the way it’s supposed to be.
GUS

He's shy, he'll grow out of it. I

sure did.

He pounces on her, making her laugh. They forget about Lars.
We hear church bells.

EXT. CHURCH - MORNING

A small Protestant church, friendly, not forbidding. We can
hear sincere, bad Protestant singing.

INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

It’s bright inside, white walls, stained glass, full of
ordinary working- and middle-class people. Behind REVEREND
BOCK the choir sits, among them MARGO, same age and type as
LARS. She looks out and notices Lars, he doesn’t see her. As
usual with sermons, no one’s listening.

REVEREND BOCK
Now, we have books and books and
books of laws. But in all the
world, there‘s really only one law.

During the sermon, Lars’s POV: he looks at the cross,
candles, flowers, a stained glass portrait of Mary and baby
Jesus, other people‘s families, the little dramas in every
pew. His gaze pauses on Margo who is looking through her
music. Next to Lars, a restless little boy drops a stuffed
animal. Lars picks it up, hands it back. He and the little
boy look at each other.

(CONTINUED)
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 4.

CONTINUED:

e@ REVEREND BOCK (CONT'D)
We need never ask, “what should I
do?” We need never pray, “Lord,
what should I do?” Because the Lord
has told us, “Love one another.”
That, my friends, is the one true
law. “Love one another” is God in
action.

The choir rises to sing badly again.
INT. CHURCH - LATER

People file out after the service. A brisk older lady, MRS.
GRUNER, 60's, tries to lift an unwieldy flower arrangement.

LARS
Need help, Mrs. Gruner?

MRS. GRUNER
Thank you, dear, it’s my turn to
drop them off at the hospital.

EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT -- LATER

e Lars carries the flowers as they walk to Mrs. Gruner‘s car.
She looks him over, approving.

MRS. GRUNER
You’re a handsome fella, Lars.
Where‘s your girlfriend?

This is a question that causes Lars pain.

LARS
I don’t have one.

MRS. GRUNER
Are you gay? Wouldn't bother me. My
grandson’s gay, I know all about
the gays.

LARS
No, I’m not gay.

MRS. GRUNER
What are you waiting for?

LARS.
I don't know.

(CONTINUED )
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 5.

CONTINUED:

MRS. GRUNER
Well, don’t wait too long, it’s not
good for you.
She hands him a flower from the arrangement.
MRS. GRUNER (CONT'D)
Give this to somebody nice, for a
start.
She drives away. Margo walks up behind LARS.

MARGO
Hello, Lars.

He turns and steps back.

LARS
Hello, Margo.

Neither of them can think what to say.

MARGO
See you at work tomorrow?

LARS
Uh-huh.

Lars starts to walk away. Margo is disappointed. Then he
turns back and thrusts the flower at her. She lights up.

MARGO
Oh! Wait--

But Lars power-walks away.
INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: KITCHEN -LATER
Gus cooks as he and Karin argue in a friendly way.
GUS
He’s 30 years old. Maybe he WANTS
to be left alone.

KARIN
That‘s NOT what he wants.

GUS
How do you know?

KARIN
Because that’s not how people are.

(CONTINUED)
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 6.

CONTINUED:

Through the window, we can see Lars sneak past, gradually
increasing speed.

GUS
(spots him)
Whoops, there he goes!
He and Karin run to the door.

GUS (CONT'D)
Lars!

Lars dashes toward his apartment.

KARIN
You promised!

Lars waves and disappears inside.

cus
Five bucks.

KARIN
Is that normal?

Gus shrugs, turns back to cooking. Karin turns back to Lars‘s
apartment, a determined look on her face.

INT. LARS’S GARAGE APT.~-WINTER--NIGHT

Lars rocks in the rocker, still wearing his church clothes,
his bed made. It’s 4 AM. He’s been awake all night.

EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: DRIVEWAY -- NEXT MORNING
Haggard, Lars drives out. Karin watches him from the house.
EXT. LARS’S CAR — DAY

Lars drives to work through small-town landscape, winter
bleak.

EXT, INDUSTRIAL PARK -- LATER
Lars parks his car.
INT. COMPANY LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS

Tired Lars enters, greeted by CINDY, the curvy African-
American receptionist.

(CONTINUED )

 
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 7.

CONTINUED:

CINDY
Morning!

LARS
Hi, Cindy.

CINDY
Party hard this weekend?

LARS
(lying)
Oh, yeah. Woo.

He's very aware of her curves, they make him anxious, yet he
can’t make himself move away from them. Cindy is fond of Lars
and likes to fix people up.

CINDY
The new girl’s cute. You and Margo,
what do you think?

Lars struggles to speak but can‘t, makes a few strange
noises.

CINDY (CONT'D)
(mystified)
Lars?

Mute, Lars waves and walks away.

CINDY (CONT’D)
Take care}!

INT. OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Discouraged, Lars enters a room with three cubicles. KURT, a
knee-jiggling co-worker, is already at his computer. Each
cubicle features personal items: KURT’s is full of action
figures. Margo's has plants and a teddy bear. Lars’s is spare-
- maybe a small picture of Gus and Karin. We hear the
distinctive REAL GIRL music theme.

KURT
You gotta see this!

LARS
I’m not in the mood for porn.

KURT
It's not porn.

(CONTINUED)

 
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 8.

CONTINUED:

Lars gives him a look.

KURT (CONT'D)
Okay, it is, but check it out!

Lars joins him reluctantly. We can’t see what’s on the
screen.

KURT (CONT'D)
Huh? Huh?

Lars looks closer.

LARS
Inflatable?

KURT
Nope. Real. Like if she’d weigh a
hundred twenty-five pounds, she
weighs a hundred twenty-five
pounds.

LARS
No.

KURT
Look, you can customize everything.
They have all these different heads
and parts. You can design your own
woman}

LARS
Huh.

KURT

Mine has the “Monique” head and the
“Jennifer” boobs and the “Tracy”
waist and the “Veronica” butt and
the “Roxanne” legs.

(man to man)
Lars, she‘s anatomically correct.
You can do anything with her.

LARS

Even--?

 

Kurt nods emphatically, Lars is repelled.

LARS (CONT'D)
But that would be like--tupperware.

(CONTINUED)
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 9.

CONTINUED:

KURT
No freckles, no zits, no hair.
BETTER than skin.

LARS
Don't tell me you’re gonna get one.

KURT
Nah, they cost six thousand bucks.
I‘m wiped out from the new X-box.

Enter Margo. She and Kurt have a playful, adversarial
relationship.

MARGO
Morning.

They don’t notice her. She tries again, louder.

MARGO (CONT'D)
Morning!

KURT
Whoa!

He zaps up a screensaver. Lars is embarrassed.
MARGO

(to Lars)
Hello.

 

Lars ducks his head, acknowledging her, scoots back into his
cubicle. Kurt turns on his headbanger work music. Lars jumps,
nerves raw. He has to tell Kurt this every day.

LARS
Headset!

KURT
Lars, it’s your day to get us
coffee.

He puts on his headset, but also watches Lars and Margo.
MARGO
I was thinking, we’re the only ones
from the lake, maybe we could
carpool.

Lars scoots out. Margo looks after him, not understanding.

(CONTINUED )
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 10.

CONTINUED:

KURT
You know what your problem is,
you're too aggressive.

MARGO
Oh, shut up.

INT. OFFICE HALLWAY -~- CONTINUOUS

Lars is extremely frustrated by his inability to respond to
Margo. He mutters to himself, runs his hands through his
hair, leaving it spiky and disheveled.

INT. OFFICE: COFFEE ROOM ~-- CONTINUOUS

STEVE, a co-worker on his way out with a plate of frosted Pop
Tarts, looks at Lars.

STEVE
You okay, buddy?

LARS
Sure.

As soon as Steve leaves, Lars opens the refrigerator freezer
and sticks his head in to revive himself. But when he takes
his head out, he feels the same.

EXT. OFFICE - DUSK

Lars steps out of the building and watches the winter sunset.
It's cold. He's not wearing hat or gloves. A razor wind
blows.

EXT. OFFICE PARKING LOT -- LATER

Margo’s car is next to Lars's car. She pretends to fumble
with her keys, watching him approach. He’s troubled, remote.

LARS POV: He sees Margo, small and far away although she
really isn’t. He stops at a distance from her.

MARGO
Hi.

LARS
Hi.

Both of them wait for the other to do something.

LARS (CONT'D)
Seeya.

(CONTINUED)

 
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 11.

CONTINUED:

MARGO
Bye.

They get in their cars and drive off in the same direction.
INT. MALL -- LATER

Lars wanders aimlessly. SANDY, 30‘s, stylish, waves at him
from her dress shop, he waves back, joyless. Lars sits at the
mall fountain. He sees nothing but families and couples. At
the food court, same thing. He buys mall food but can‘t eat.
He feels his isolation like a physical illness.

EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: DRIVEWAY -- LATER

As Lars drives in from work, Karin stands in the middle of
the driveway with a flashlight, flagging him down like the
airport person on a runway. He slams on the brakes and jumps
out of his car, fearing disaster.

LARS
Are you okay? What happened? What's
wrong?

KARIN

We want you to come for dinner.

Lars is immediately wary. Karin bounces a little on her toes,
preparing to move.

LARS.
(lying) I can’t. I brought work
home.

He tries to dodge her, she blocks him.

KARIN
No, you didn’t.
LARS
If I don’t get it done, I’m in

trouble.
He dodges, she blocks.

KARIN
We miss you.

LARS

(lying)
I'll be there in a minute.

(CONTINUED )

 
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 12.

CONTINUED:

Dodge, block.

KARIN
Oh, no, you don't!

He breaks for the garage, she chases and tackles him. They
struggle on the ground.

LARS
I hear my phone!

KARIN
Salmon, rosemary potatoes!

LARS
I have other plans!

KARIN
Broccoli and pie!

LARS
(claws at the lawn or
snow)
Thank you but let me go!

KARIN
No!

She straddles him and holds him down. Lars goes limp. She’s
won.

LARS
Okay, okay.

INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: DINING ROOM -- LATER

The end of the meal. Lars is distant and quiet, he’s hardly
eaten anything. Gus and Karin exchange looks. Hers says,
“Talk to him!” His says, “What do I say?”

KARIN

(to Lars, gentle)
Tf that’s all you can eat...

LARS
Delicious.

Karin begins to clear the table. Lars starts to help her,
eager to escape.

KARIN
Nope, my turn. You boys talk.

(CONTINUED )
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 13.

CONTINUED:

She leaves, giving Gus another pointed look. Gus and Lars sit
in silence.

INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
They sit in silence.

GUS
(finally)
She thinks you have a problem.
Staying by yourself so much.

LARS.
What do you think?

GUS
I don’t know. Dad was kinda like
that.

LARS
Well, I’m not Dad!

Gus is startled by his vehemence.
LARS (CONT'D)
He was more like a refrigerator
than a man.

GUS
No, he wasn’t.

Lars looks at him, he concedes.
GUS (CONT'D)
Only after Mom died. I wish you
could have known him before.

LARS
I wish I could have known HER.

Gus is sympathetic but more occupied with his own discomfort
than Lars’s feelings, of which he is barely aware. He makes
an offer, just short of sincere.
GUS
You know, we'd really like it if
you move in.
Lars shakes his head no. He knows Gus doesn't really mean it.

GUS (CONT'D)
The house is half yours.

(CONTINUED)
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 14.

CONTINUED:
e LARS
IT can't.
Gus
I don’t see why.
Lars shrugs. They have nothing else to say to each other.
They sit there.
LINDSTROM HOUSE: BACK DOOR -- LATER

Karin and Gus walk Lars to the door. Karin gives him

tupperware.
KARIN
Here are leftovers for you.
LARS
Thanks. I was wondering--my
blanket?
KARIN
(to Gus)
It's by the--
e cvs
I'll get it. |
He goes. Lars is distant, preoccupied. Karin tries to
converse.
KARIN
It's a beautiful blanket.
LARS.
My mother made it for me before I
was born.
KARIN
She loved you very much. Like we
do.

She reaches to hug him, he steps back.

KARIN (CONT'D)
Are you mad at me?

LARS
No!

(CONTINUED )
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 15.

CONTINUED:
KARIN
Then why don’t you want me to touch
you?
LARS

I think you're imagining things.
Gus returns and hands the blanket to Lars.

LARS (CONT'D)
Thanks. Night.

cus
Night.

KARIN
Night.

Karin leans against Gus and he hugs her. They watch Lars walk
across the yard to his dark apartment.

KARIN (CONT'D)
Gus...

GUS
We talked, he’s fine.

LARS POV: At his threshhold, he looks back over his shoulder,
sees Karin and Gus in each other‘’s arms, they seem a million
miles away. He closes the door, which fills the frame and
everything goes black.

SIX WEEKS LATER
INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: FRONT DOOR -- AFTERNOON

The doorbell rings, Karin opens the door, it’s FRED, the UPS
man.

KARIN
Hi, Fred.

FRED
Hi, Karin. Package for Lars.

She signs for it.
KARIN

you can give it to me, I’11 take it
back.

(CONTINUED)

 
LARS by Nancy Oliver - 16.
CONTINUED:

FRED
Too heavy. I'll bring it around
with a hand truck and Gus can carry
it when he gets home.
He unloads a coffin-like box. It’s heavy even for Fred.
EXT. LARS’S GARAGE APT.-- LATER

Karin unlocks Lars’s door, Gus drags the box inside. Karin
carries a casserole dish.

INT. LARS'’S GARAGE APT.-- CONTINUOUS
Gus sets the box on the floor and stretches his back,

cus
Jesus Christ.

KARIN
I couldn't read the shipping label.

She puts the casserole in the refrigerator.
GUS
See, he’s taking an interest in
things.

KARIN
He is a lot more cheerful lately.

GUS
Must be expecting this.

KARIN
We'll give him a call.

They leave. The box lies on the floor.
INT. OFFICE -- LATER
In his cubicle, Lars hangs up the phone, his eyes shining.

LARS
Oh...

He bursts into a flurry of activity, cleaning his workspace.
Margo's head pops up over one cubicle wall, Kurt’s over the
other. They watch him tear out of the office.

 

 
LARS by Nancy Oliver - 17.

EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER
He pulls into the driveway as if it were a pit stop.
INT. LARS’S GARAGE APT. -- MOMENTS LATER
He flings open the apartment door, looks at the box.
INT. LARS'S BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER
He brushes his teeth, combs his hair and straightens his tie.
He looks at himself critically in the mirror. Not quite
right.

cur TO:
MOMENTS LATER
He’s changed into a more casual, sporty sweater, likes it
better. And he’s put on music--bachelor jazz, lots of sax. He
has an expectant look.

INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: KITCHEN -- EVENING

Someone knocks firmly on the back door. Gus answers, it’s
Lars. He’s surprised and pleased, LARS never does this.

Gus
Come in, come in.

INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: FAMILY ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Fire in the fireplace. Karin does pregnant woman yoga. She's
surprised, too. Lars is hesitant, but there’s something a
little more bold about him.

LARS
I have a visitor.

Gus
That’s great!

KARIN
A visitor!

LARS
She's not from here.

KARIN
She?

Karin’s so pleased she punches Gus in the arm.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 18.

CONTINUED:
LARS
I mean she’s from another country.
Gus
Wow, what do you know. Where‘’d you
meet her?
LARS

On the internet.

KARIN
Everybody does that now.

LARS
She doesn’t speak much English.

cus
Oh, that’s okay. Same with guys at
work. We manage.

LARS
And she’s handicapped.

This takes Gus and Karin aback, but only a little.

GUS
Well, so what? We don’t care.

LARS
The thing is, she can’t stay with
me. We're both young and single and
she’s religious, it wouldn't be
right. So...

Gus and Karin are excited and pleased.

KARIN
We'll put her in the pink room, and
there are new towels. Just give me
half an hour to pick up and get
something in the oven.

LARS
(pleased with himself)
Okey doke.

Karin starts to hug him but remembers she can’t. Instead she
starts cleaning.

GUS
(proud, to Lars)
Man, you quiet ones...
LARS by Nancy Oliver - 19.

INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: LIVING ROOM -- LATER

Karin and Gus frozen on the living room sofa, they have
washed up and changed to better clothes. Their faces are dull
with shock.

LARS (0.C.)
This is Bianca.
(to someone who doesn’t
speak English) )
Bianca, this is my brother Gus and
my sister-in-law Karen.

Lars and BIANCA, a life-size sex doll, sit across from them.
Bianca is a cafe au lait color with long wavy red-gold hair.
She wears a gold lame miniskirt, tight over-the-knee black
vinyl boots and a see-through black mesh midriff top over a
brief gold lame bra. Lars is oblivious to this.

LARS (CONT'D)
She's a missionary, but she’s on
sabbatical to experience the world.
Karin nods slowly, Gus can’t move.

LARS (CONT'D)
She's shy. Everything is so new.

KARIN
(hoarse)
Are you hungry?
LARS
Starving.

We--uh--

Kitchen.

LARS
Come on, Bianca.

He lifts her in his arms, awkward but confident.

LARS (CONT'D)
Don’t worry, I gotcha.

He carries her into the dining room.

 
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 20.

INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

Gus and Karin put food on two plates and talk in intense
whispers. We catch glimpses of Lars arranging Bianca in a
chair. Gus is flipping.

GUS
He’s crazy!

KARIN
Calm down. Calm.

cus
We have to put him in a hospital!

KARIN
Nobody’s putting anybody anywhere.

cus
I can’t believe it. My little
brother’s insane!

KARIN
(£irm)
Pull yourself together. If we show
how we feel, who knows what could
happen. We can do this. Honey, we
can. We have to.

Gus gets a grip, wipes his eyes.

cus
Yeah.

KARIN
She’s our guest.

Gus nods, he’s on board. Karin looks at the plates in her
hands, shaken herself.

KARIN (CONT'D)
Lars.
(hands him the other
plate)
Bianca.

She walks toward the dining room.

GUS
Karin, she can‘t eat!
LARS by Nancy Oliver - 21.

e INT. DINING ROOM -- LATER

Wooden but trying, Gus and Karin sit across from Lars and
Bianca. Lars eats from both plates, enthusiastic, careful to
include Bianca in the conversation.

LARS
Bianca's from the tropics. She’s
half Brazilian and half Danish.
That's where she gets her exotic
coloring.

KARIN
Ah.

Gus
Mm.

LARS
Unfortunately, her luggage was
stolen. They even took her
wheelchair.

KARIN
I’m so sorry.

GUS
That's terrible.

LARS
I was wondering if you could help
her out.

Karin cocks her head with a strained smile, not sure what he
wants.

LARS (CONT'D)
With clothes.

KARIN
I’m not sure we're the same--type.

LARS
That’s okay. Bianca doesn’t care
about superficial things.
INT. PINK BEDROOM -- LATER

Lars and Bianca sit on the bed, Karin and Gus stand looking
at them.

(CONTINUED)

 

 
 

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 22.

CONTINUED:

KARIN
Gus had a good idea.

Gus looks at her blankly.

KARIN (CONT'D)
He's concerned about Bianca’s
health. Change of climate,
travel...

GUS
(catching on)
Stress. And stuff.

KARIN
I'll make an appointment with Dr.
Bergen for, mm, tomorrow? Early.

sus
We’1ll all go.

LARS.
That makes sense. I'm taking off
work to shop for wheelchairs.

He stretches and yawns.

LARS (CONT'D)
Well, we better hit the hay.
(intimate)
Good night, Bianca. I’m glad you're
finally here.

Gus looks over his shoulder helplessly at Karin as he follows
Lars out. Karin looks at the doll. Bianca falls over on the
bed, staring sightlessly.

KARIN
Wait!

INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

She steps into the hall with Lars and Gus. She has to work to
keep her voice steady.

KARIN
Any idea how long she’1ll stay?

LARS

(brightly)
Nope.

LARS by Nancy Oliver - 23.

CONTINUED:

Lars and Gus continue downstairs, Gus looks back at Karin,
wild-eyed. Karin stands alone for a moment in the hall, then
girds herself to return to Bianca.

INT. PINK BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Karin is overcome with curiosity: she peeks under Bianca’‘s
skirt.

KARIN
Oh, my GOD.

EXT. LARS’S GARAGE APT. -- LATER

Lars drags the box out of his apartment, Gus stands in the
yard, not knowing what to do.

LARS
Gotta put this in the recycling.

Gus grabs it.

Gus
I’1l do it.

LARS
Thanks, Gus.

cus
No problem.

Lars goes inside. Gus attacks the box, tearing at it, looking
for information. He finds the packing slip.

INT. STUDY -- MOMENTS LATER

Gus sits at his computer. We hear REAL GIRL theme music. He
clicks his mouse and a 1-900 woman's voice speaks.

COMPUTER
Natasha escaped from Moscow where
she was forced to be a stripper for
the Russian Mafia. Now all she
wants is a good American male to
love.

Gus clicks again.

COMPUTER (CONT'D)
Samantha is a coed. Someday she’1ll
be a personal fitness trainer, but
now she’s taking time off school to
find the perfect guy.

Gus clicks again.

COMPUTER (CONT'D)
Midori left a high-paying job in
Tokyo because she was unsatisfied
as a woman. Looks don’t count, it's
the inner spirit that truly excites
her.

Gus clicks again.

COMPUTER (CONT’D)
Tammy dropped out of high school to
ride in the rodeo. Are you the
right cowboy to tame this wild
filly?

INT. PINK BEDROOM - LATER

Bianca, in a flannel nightgown, lies under the covers in the

glow of a nightlight.
INT. GUS AND KARIN’S BEDROOM -- LATER

Gus and Karin lie in bed, freaked out and wide awake.

KARIN
The doctor will tell us what to do.
cus
She's family practice. We need a
shrink.
KARIN
She‘s a psychologist, too.
GUS
Oh.
KARIN
She says you have to be, this far
North.
GUS

What will people think.

KARIN
We can’t worry about that.

They worry.

Right.
They don’t sleep.
INT. LARS'S GARAGE APT.-- LATER
Under his mother’s blanket, Lars sleeps like a baby.
INT. GUS'S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

Gus, Karin, Lars and Bianca drive through town to DAGMAR’'s

LARS
Huh. Water and Power.

INT. DR. DAGMAR BERGEN’S WAITING ROOM -- DAY

The waiting room is packed with other townspeople: an old
man, a middle-aged woman, a young mother and her toddler, a
couple of teenagers. Karin, Gus, Lars and Bianca, in her new
wheelchair, sit with them. Karin nods and smiles bravely at
the other people. Gus suffers. Lars offers magazines to
Bianca.

INT. EXAM ROOM -- LATER

Lars and Bianca sit with DAGMAR, a woman in her 60's,
understated and humorous, with a carefully controlled

intensity. She’s seen everything, but Lars and Bianca really
interest her. Dagmar checks the cuff on Bianca’s arm.

DAGMAR

Well, her blood pressure’s low.
LARS

Is that serious?
DAGMAR

Could be. We'll have to wait and

see.

Lars is distressed though he tries not to show it.

LARS
I knew she had health problems
but...

DAGMAR

I want you to bring her in every
week for a special treatment. will
you do that?

LARS
Of course! Whatever she needs.

He explains to Bianca, making sure she understands.

LARS (CONT'D)
Every week. Special treatment.

Karin and Gus sit in front of Dagmar, arguing, with some
heat.

GUS
I'm telling you, he belongs in a
hospital.

KARIN

No! My Uncle Garth went to one of
those places and never came back.

Never! He's a sweetheart, he never

abnormal too, isn’t it.

GUS
You gotta fix him. Can you fix him?

DAGMAR
There isn't a pill for lonely, Gus.

This quiets both of them.

DAGMAR (CONT'D)
Of course I encourage you to get a
second opinion. But I don’t believe
he's psychotic or schizophrenic. I
don’t think this is caused by genes
er faulty wiring in the brain.

sus
So what the hell is going on?

: DAGMAR

He appears to have a delusion.

Gus
What’s he doing with a delusion,
for Christ's sake?

DAGMAR
That's what we have to find out.
Chances are he’s been
decompensating for some time.

They look at her, perplexed.

DAGMAR (CONT'D)
Losing his psychological balance.

Karin and Gus look at each other, both full of guilt for not
noticing.

bad thing.

They look at her in disbelief.

DAGMAR (CONT’D)
What we call mental illness isn’t
always just an illness. It can be a
communication or a way to work
something out. The delusion.

Great. When will it be over?

LARS
Bianca LOVES children.

EXT. THE TOWN -- DAWN

The winter sun rises on all the small-town middle-class
houses, doughnut shops, random trailers, open fields, empty
roads, 24~hr gas station/convenience stores.

EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: DINING ROOM -- MORNING

Gus, Karin, Lars and Bianca sit at the breakfast table. Gus's

something he wants to say. Karin and Gus wait, frightened. Is

blurts.

Gus slumps back down at the table and buries his head in his
hands.

She takes an action figure from her pocket and puts it in a

really singing since all the other people are staring at
Bianca. When everyone sits, Margo stays standing in the
choir, astonished, till somebody pulls her into her seat.

running around. Me and Peter and
Brian and Doug and Stuey and oh,

It’s a good thing you sent that
memo. I would have FREAKED. It’s so
bizARRE.

MARGO
{watching Jerry)
It‘s a disorder. Like compulsive
eating.

It goes right over Jerry's head.

JERRY
What a weirdo.

MARGO
When you were little, didn’t you
believe your toys were alive?

JERRY
That's different. They’re only
alive at night when you're asleep.

Lars whispers something in Bianca’s ear.

LISA

He's creepy, he scares me.
MARGO

Lars?
JERRY

Look at him. He’s in love with that
slutty hunk of rubber.

MARGO

Her name is Bianca and you don’t
even know her.

JERRY
Ethnic.

LISA

JERRY
That’s what she’s FOR, babe.

LISA
Ew, how CAN he?

MARGO
Well, she’s prettier than a lot of
people and definitely smarter.

LISA
They should lock him up and toss
the key.

Jerry agrees with his mouth full.
MARGO
I heard you two are getting
married.

JERRY LISA
No! Yes!

Jerry and Lisa turn on each other. Pleased, MARGO moves on.

INT. CINDY’S HOUSE: LIVING ROOM -- LATER

Lars stands with a couple of guys, they talk about computers
er sports. He keeps an eye on Bianca, who is off to the side.
Kurt talks animatedly to Bianca about himself. Lars notices
Margo laughing with ERIC, who's tall, good-looking in a bland
Viking way. Lars doesn’t quite know how to feel about it. He
can’t help but appreciate Margo's curves, how attractive and
nice she is.

INT. CINDY'S HOUSE: LIVING ROOM -- LATER

Lars and Bianca sit with co-worker women: Cindy, Margo,
TERRI, and VICTORIA. The women are kind of drunk and talking
all at once, like birds. Lars is delighted, surrounded by
women, he's never had so much female attention.

Baxter dances around Bianca’s wheelchair, Cindy dances
enthusiastically with Lars who is so shy he just stands
there, Kurt dances with Margo.

Lars sits on the floor and watches the fire as the party goes
on around him. He looks up at Bianca and smiles at her. He's
very happy.

EXT. CINDY'S DOORWAY -- LATER

Cindy and Margo wave from the open doorway as Lars and Bianca
drive away. Margo is wistful.

CINDY
I like her, but that’s a big waste
of a good guy.

MARGO
Yeah.
CINDY
So, you and Eric, what do you
think?
Margo perks up.
MARGO

Maybe.
They close the door.

INT. HOCKEY RINK

Kurt, Baxter, Lars and Bianca watch a hockey game. The guys

INT. CHURCH - DAY

Sitting in the pew behind Lars and Bianca, Mrs. Gruner leans
forward and whispers.

MRS. GRUNER
Bianca wants to spend Thursday
afternoons with me.

LARS
(to Bianca)
You do?

MRS. GRUNER
She wants to volunteer at the
hospital.
LARS
(possessive)
I don’t know. Her blood pressure...
MRS. GRUNER
Lars. Think of the little bald
children. Won’t they love her!
He has to admit they will.
INT. PINK BEDROOM -- DAY
Lars sits with Bianca. Across the hall he sees Karin who is
doing something in her bedroom. He notes her swelling belly,
his face unreadable.
INT. DAGMAR‘S OFFICE
Lars and Dagmar sit next to each other, arm in arm, lightly.

DAGMAR
Pain?

LARS
I can take it.

We can see Lars’s need for and appreciation of female contact

other.

DAGMAR

Don’t you want to be an uncle?
LARS

Yeah, I do. I think about it all

the time.

Dagmar watches him like a hawk. He twists his hands without

knowing it

LARS (CONT'D)
You know, Bianca can’t have
children. Because of her condition.

DAGMAR
That's a shame.

He gets up and paces.

LARS
Not really. At least she’s safe. In
Bianca‘s culture, there's a high
rate of infant mortality. And her
mother, well, when Bianca was born,
her mother died right in the middle
of things.

DAGMAR
Like yours.

LARS
Yeah. Strange.

DAGMAR
You have a lot in common.

LARS
But it could happen again, Dagmar.
It could.

Dagmar won't lie to him.

DAGMAR
Yes. It could.

LARS
That would be the end of
everything.

He’s pouring sweat.

LARS (CONT'D)
They have no idea of the danger. No

Lars is finding it hard to breathe.

DAGMAR
Put your head between your knees.

He does. She rubs his back in circles, gently. He reacts with
pain, but lets her continue.

DAGMAR (CONT’D)
That’s a lot of pressure, Lars, to
be the only one who knows the
danger. Maybe we could talk to them
about it.

LARS
No, no! What good would it do.
Don't say anything. Let them be
happy while they can.

breath.

who knows it’s a dream. Because YOU
understand we're not just talking
about a baby here. We‘re talking
about life and death.

Lars raises his head.

DAGMAR (CONT'D)
You see the big picture.

LARS
I wish I didn’t.

DAGMAR
I know. But somebody has to.

Lars sits up a little more.

LARS
What kind of world is it? When
someone’s born someone else has to
die.

DAGMAR
That’s what it’s all about.
Everything comes and goes. Can't be
summer all the time.

Lars sits up more, stubborn.

LARS
It can in the tropics.

Lars happily wheels Bianca around the mall. Some people greet
them, some stare. Sandy beckons them to her dress shop.

INT. TOWN HALL -- NIGHT

Bianca in attendance at a town meeting, seated between Lars
and Mr. Hofstedtler. In front of them, a panel of citizens
reports its findings. Lars is bored. MR. FOX is the universal
droning bureaucrat.

MR. FOX
Pursuant to standard procedure, the
Athletic Funds Allocation Committee
has responded to the request of the
Extracurricular Activities Panel by
investigating the possibility of
purchasing a new or perhaps pre-
owned volleyball.

LARS
Mr. Hofstedtler, I think Bianca’s
bored.

MR. HOFSTEDTLER
Well, she wanted to see American
politics. That’s what she told me.

Lars sighs.

MR. FOX
We will now open discussion to

Kurt plays with his action figures. Lars arranges pictures in
his cubicle--candids of Bianca with other people. He notices

LARS
That's right.

Lars returns to his desk, irritated, without knowing why.
INT. MARGO’S CUBICLE -- LATER

She‘s surprised, he so rarely exhibits emotion.

KARIN

What if I took off and left her
alone. What if I abandoned her. How
would she feel?

KARIN
Stop yelling, she didn’t abandon

Lars doesn’t stop yelling.

LARS

How do I know that? I don’t know
that. You never know who’s coming
back and who isn’t. People do
whatever they want, they just go,
they don’t care, they don’t think
about how I feel! They don’t care
about me!

Karin gets mad.

KARIN
Now wait just a darn minute. We do
care, we all care.

LARS
No, you don’t! Nobody cares about
me!

KARIN
That is not true! Every person in
this town bends over backwards to

shaman to teach them.

Gus is absorbed in creating, he's not really listening.

and sits with her. Kindly, gently, he takes the bear away
from her and starts to take the noose apart.

MARGO
It's not only the bear. I broke up
with Bric.

Lars offers insincere sympathy.

LARS
Sorry to hear that.

MARGO
I didn’t even have a good reason.
He just wasn’t very -- interesting.

LARS
Then why was he your boyfriend?

MARGO
(defensive)
I get lonely, is that so hard to
understand?

LARS
No.

He returns the repaired bear to her. He almost pats her in
sympathy, but can't quite manage to touch her.

MARGO
What are you and Bianca doing
Friday night?

LARS
School Board meeting with Mr.
Hofstedtler.
(proud)
Bianca got elected.

Okay.

Why?

I was thinking we all could go out
somewhere.

She shrugs and starts to walk back to the office, blue.

MARGO (CONT'D)
Never mind.

LARS
(impulse)
After I drop her off I'm free.

Margo turns and smiles at him.
INT. BOWLING ALLEY -- NIGHT

Margo concentrates as she raises a bowling ball in front of
her face, then hurls it down the alley with appropriate body
language. She makes a spare.

Lars takes his turn, knocking three off the right. Margo
cools her hand over the air vent. Lars knocks one pin off on
the right. He’s annoyed with himself.

MARGO
You're not following through.

LARS
I know, I know.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS

Moose, Hector, Nelson and Sean check for available lanes.
They each have their own gear. Russell works behind the desk,
spraying shoes.

Margo and Nelson are neck and neck for the lead, then Moose,
Lars and Sean.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY -- LATER

They are all bowling together having a wonderful time. Margo
watches Lars when he’s not watching her. He makes her smile
and he makes her sad.

NELSON
(to Margo, tesing)
Mahgong, kick you butt!

MARGO
No, Nelson, I kick YOU butt.

Lars watches Margo while she’s not watching him. She makes
him smile and she makes him sad.

MOOSE
{to Margo)
Baby, where you been all my life?

Moose winks at Lars as Margo laughs.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY -- LATER

Margo and Lars sit at a table behind the other bowlers,
changing out of their bowling shoes. Something is on Lars's

mind. She looks around the bowling alley with a little burst
of happiness.

MARGO
This was exactly what I needed,

for bowling with me, Lars.

She is very close and very pretty. Lars can smell her
perfume.

LARS
(blurting)
Don’t get the wrong idea. I'll
never cheat on Bianca.

Margo is shocked and appalled.

MARGO
Oh, no! I would never! I hope you
didn't think -- Lars, no. I can't
compete with her, I'd never try.

LARS
A man doesn’t cheat on his woman.

MARGO
Absolutely. And vice versa.
Besides, I don’t need to steal

anybody’s boyfriend. One of these
days, I’ll find a man of my own and
we'll be happy, too.

They watch the snow fall for another moment.

MARGO (CONT'D)
Thanks again.

LARS
Night.

As Margo turns to leave, he suddenly pulls off his glove and
sticks out his bare hand at her. Margo is taken by surprise.

MARGO
Ah!

Lars takes a step closer, his hand still extended, as Margo
realizes what he wants. She takes off her glove and they
shake hands. The touch of her flesh sends an electric current
through Lars. Kurt was wrong. Nothing's better than skin.
Lars’s hand buzzes with sensation. He feels it all over his
body. Margo takes her hand away slowly.

MARGO (CONT'D)
Night.

She walks away. Lars puts his hand to his cheek.

INT. BATHROOM -- NIGHT

Bianca‘s balanced on the edge of the tub in a towel. Lars
dries her slowly, tracing the lines of her face. Then the
outline of her body: her neck, her shoulder, her arm,
gathering information about the female form. It’s bizarrely
tender, sensual and intimate.

INT. FAMILY ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Karin lies down, her feet elevated into Gus’s lap where he
massages them diligently. Gus stops massaging and listens.

leoks at him and shakes her head slightly. Lars rubs his
face.

EXT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: BACKYARD ~- DAY

Green shoots in the garden. Karin, muddy, inspects carefully.
Bianca holds the garden tools.

INT. LINDSTROM HOUSE: BABY'S ROOM

Gus and Lars paint the walls, listening to sports on the
radio. They converse without much thought, if any.

LARS
You care if it’s a boy or a girl?

ous
Nah.

LARS
Me, neither.

cus
I just want a kid. Don’t know why.

LARS
Yeah, me, too.

Gus give him a look, but Lars is happily painting.

INT. LARS‘'S GARAGE APT.-- EVENING

Bianca lies on Lars's sofa, as if she’s ill, in his arms.
LARS blots her face with a cool cloth. He kisses her forehead

and looks worried and loving.

She grabs her purse and dashes out to Cindy, laughing as Kurt
pelts her with objects.

CINDY
This place is a big kindergarten.

A few moments quiet after the big battle. Lars stretches out.

KURT (CONT'D)

Lars, we have plenty, it’s almost
April.
But Lars keeps chopping.
INT. EXAM ROOM
Thoughtful, Dagmar looks at Bianca on the table.
INT. HALLWAY —- CONTINUOUS

Lars waits nervously. JOANNE walks by him. He catches her arm
and blurts, desperate for reassurance.

LARS
Dagmar wanted to see her alone
today.
Joanne, compassionate, gives him a squeeze, he accepts it.
JOANNE
You hang in there, Lars.
Everything's gonna be okay.
He tries to smile at her.

INT. DAGMAR'S OFFICE -- LATER

Dagmar holds both of Lars’s hands, which doesn’t seem to
bother him at all now. She’s very serious.

LARS
Just say it.

DAGMAR

No! She doesn’t want to go, she

Bianca lies in bed, still in her pajamas, Lars stands beside
her, Gus runs in.

An ambulance speeds through the streets, Gus and Karin follow

INT. HOSPITAL -- LATER

Swinging doors burst open as, lying on a gurney, Bianca is
rushed to a treatment room. Gus, Karin and Lars follow. NURSE
AMY stops them, compassionate.

NURSE AMY
I’m sorry, you’ll have to wait out
here. Dr. Bergen’s on the way.

Gus puts his arm around Lars’s shoulder pulls him away from
the door. Lars is distraught.

LARS
I want to be with her!

GUS
It’s okay, it’s okay...

They step away, Gus tries to talk LARS down. Karin and Amy
share a few private words.

KARIN
Oh, no.

Bianca‘s very sick.
@ Karin looks at Lars. She and Gus are alarmed.
KARIN
No, she isn’t. She couldn’t be.

They all try to absorb this. Lars stands.

LARS
Where is she?

Dagmar and Lars walk away as Gus and Karin look at each
other, at a total loss.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- LATER

Outside the door to Bianca’s room, hospital personnel and
other patients peek to see Lars at Bianca’s bedside, holding
her hand, his head bowed. Nurse Amy steps in, softly closes
the door, and addresses the troops.

If anybody laughs or bothers that
boy, you‘re on the next bus to
Siberia, I kid you not. Move along.

She shoos them away.

loved one.

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- LATER

Karin, Gus and Dagmar in discussion. Dagmar is excited in her
own calm way.

KARIN
What‘’s it going to do to him?
How can we let it happen?

DAGMAR
We're not letting it happen, it’s
Lars. It‘s always been Lars.

Gus defends him.

GUS
He didn’t ask to be lonely or sick
in the head.

DAGMAR
No, no, of course not. But do
you see? He’s making the decisions.
He’s the one who found her
unconscious, he’s the one who said
she’s terminal.

KARIN
You saw his face. Why would he put
himself through this.

DAGMAR
Partly, I think it’s your mother. I
think he’s reliving the greatest
loss of his life. Only he's not a
helpless infant now, this time he
has a chance to come through it
whole.

GUS
But that doesn’t connect. Mom’s
heart stopped on the table. Lars

A funeral on a beautiful, sunny spring day. Around the grave,
people stand or sit in folding chairs. No one wears black.
Almost everyone we've seen is present except children. Lars
sits with Karin, Gus and Dagmar. He has just finished a
crying spasm, is distant and quiet for the moment, in the
space between waves of grief. The mourners are a little
restless, unsure of how to behave at such a curious occasion.

today. He did that to remind us
that this is no ordinary funeral.
Oh, no. Instead he would like us to
join together in celebration of
Bianca’s extraordinary life.

@ The mourners settle, interested.

REVEREND BOCK (CONT'D)
Without even trying, Bianca brought
to this town the warmth, the
laughter, the vivid color of her
native tropics. She was a listener
and a teacher. She was a lesson in
courage and constancy. Did you ever
once see her yield to disability or
despair?

People shake their heads, no, they never did. Everyone is
moved in their own way.

REVEREND BOCK (CONT’D)
There is not one among us who could
match her work ethic or her
serenity in the face of illness and
even death.

The word touches them all and makes it real.
REVEREND BOCK (CONT'D)
From her wheelchair, Bianca touched

all of us in ways we could never
e have predicted.

The mourners agree, this is very true.

REVEREND BOCK (CONT'D)
And she left us with glowing
memories of her generosity, her
delightful company and her love of
humanity. Oh, yes. We can be sure
Bianca loved us all. Especially
Lars.

Everyone becomes aware of him. They watch him, compassionate.

REVEREND BOCK (CONT’D)
ESPECIALLY him. But Lars, don’t
forget, she was first and foremost
a missionary. A servant of God.

Lars nods. He won't forget.

REV. BOCK
So let us not grieve for her. Let
us not suffer. Let us rejoice.
Bianca has not gone, she has gone
AHEAD, where we all must go one
day. And she will be there to greet
us on that day, when we too return
to our true home, safe forever in
the bosom of the Lord. Amen.

PEOPLE
Amen.

He begins to recite the Twenty-Third Psalm. Everyone knows
the words, some say it along with him.

REV. BOCK
“The Lord is my shepherd, I shall
not want, He leadeth me beside
still waters, he restoreth my
soul...”

EXT. CEMETERY -- LATER

The service is over, people disperse, talking. Gus and Karin
talk to various configurations of friends and neighbors.

Dagmar watches Lars as he accepts condolences, hugs, shakes
hands, reaches out. Margo, too watches Lars from a distance.

GUS
Come back to the house. Please.
Bring the kids. We‘d love to have
you.

@ KARIN

We finally decided. Paul Lars if

it’s a boy and Elinor Bianca if

it’s a girl.
It's clear that everybody will gather at the Lindstrom house.

cur TO:
SAME -- LATER
Gus approaches Dagmar. They look at Lars.
GUS

Can Lars drive with you? We have to

be home when people start showing

up and I don’t want to rush him...

DAGMAR
of course.

cus
What comes next?

DAGMAR
@ As usual, I have no idea.

They marvel at the strange and wonderful person Lars is.

GUS
He‘s--unbelievable.

DAGMAR
The most creative, resourceful--and
he’s strong, Gus, he's really
strong.

cus
I never knew. I never knew him.

Gus is full of emotion.
GUS (CONT'D)
I don’t know what to say. How to
thank you. Without you...I mean,
he’s my brother...
He can’t find the words.

DAGMAR
e It's a privilege.

Karin motions to him from a distance.

KARIN
Gus!

Gus
See you at the house?

DAGMAR
I'll be there.

He hugs her warmly, he goes. Dagmar stays in the background
watching, as people leave. She is amused and moved by the
whole experience.

CUT TO:
EXT. CEMETERY -- LATER

The cemetery is empty except for Lars, Margo and Dagmar, who
stand quite apart from one another. Margo and Lars are
unaware of Dagmar. Lars looks at the headstones, his mother,
his father and “Bianca, Beloved Friend.” Dagmar starts toward
him, but from another direction, Margo joins Lars at the
grave. Dagmar stops and watches.

LARS
We used to come here sometimes. She
liked it, even in winter,

MARGO
I like it, too. Peaceful.

They stand together looking at Bianca's grave. Dagmar watches
the simple scene. We can hear birds.

LARS
She asked me to let go, she said
she was ready. She told me not to
be sad. But I can’t help it.

MARGO
Me, neither.

LARS
We'll feel better as time goes on.
That’s what people say.

MARGO

It's true, I think, in a way. But
there‘1l never be anyone like her.

LARS
Never.

They stand for a few more moments, remembering Bianca. Then
Lars wipes his eyes, looks around at the day and takes a
breath. Dagmar smiles and walks away, leaving them alone.

MARGO
(doesn’t really want to)
I guess we should catch up with
everybody else.
LARS
(doesn’t really want to)
In a while. You wanna take a walk?

MARGO
Yes.

They wander off into the sunlight together.
