INT. SUITE - NIGHT

A smoky, overdecorated cocktail lounge and nightclub on
Queens Boulevard. Sergio Franchi is in full voice on the
JUKEBOX. It is after midnight. It has been a long
night. Balloons and empty glasses litter the place.
BILLY BATTS, a 50-year-old hood in an out-of-date suit,
holding court at the bar. We see a younger, more
sharply-dressed HOOD walk in with a beehive girl friend
and hug Batts.

HOOD
-Billy. You look beautiful.
Welcome home.

BATTS
(laughing and turn-
ing to the
bartender)
What are you having? Give
what they're drinking.

‘em

We see four other men, including HENRY HILL and JAMES
CONWAY, standing near Billy Batts at the bar, raise their
glasses in salute. TOMMY DEVITO and ancther beehive
blonde enter. Billy Batts looks up and sees Tommy.

BATTS
Hey, look at him. Tommy. You
grew up.

TOMMY
(preening a little)
Billy, how are you?

BATTS
(smiling broadly at
Tommy and the girl)
Son of a bitch. Get over here.

Tommy walks over and Billy, too aggressively, grabs Tommy
around the neck. Tommy doesn't like it.

TOMMY
(forcing a laugh)
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.

BATTS
(squeezing Tommy's
cheek, a little too
hard)
Listen to him. ‘Watch the suit,'
he says.

BATTS (CONT'D)
A little pisser I've known all my
life. Hey, Tommy, don't get too
big.

TOMMY
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?

BATTS
(laughing, to the
crowd at the bar)
Busting his balls?
(to Tommy)
If I was busting your balls, I'd
send you home for your shine box.

Tommy's smile turns to a glare as he realizes Billy is
making fun of him. The men at the bar are roaring with
laughter. His girl is looking glumly at her shoes.

BATTS
(to the hoods at the
bar)
You remember Tommy's shines? The
kid was great. He made mirrors.

_ TOMMY
(almost a threat)
No more shines, Billy.

BATTS
Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're
only kidding. You can't take a
joke? Come ooonn.

We see that Tommy is still angry, but begins to relax
with Billy's apparent apology, but as soon as Billy

sees that Tommy is beginning to relax, he contemptuously
turns his back on Tommy.

BATTS
(facing the bar)
Now get the hell home and get your
shine box.

Henry quickly steps in front of Tommy who is about to
explode. Batts is facing the bar and does not see just
how furious Tommy has become.

HENRY
(gently. wrestling
Tommy away from the
bar)
Come on, relax. He's drunk.

HENRY (CONT'D)
He's been locked up for six years.

TOMMY
I don't give a shit. The guy’s
got no right.

HENRY
Tommy. He doesn't mean anything.
Forget about it.

TOMMY
(trying to wrestle
past Henry)
He's insulting me. Rat bastard.
He's never been any fuckin’ good.

HENRY
Tommy. Come on. Relax.

TOMMY
(te Henry)
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.

Tommy roughly grabs his girl's arm and storms out.

HENRY
{rejoining James and
Billy Batts at the
bar) .
Batts. I'm sorry. Tommy gets
loaded. He doesn't mean any
disrespect.

BATTS
He's got a hot head.

We see the last two guests get up to leave. Henry puts
another dollar in the jukebox and moves back behind the
bar and starts to total the register receipts.

CUT TO:
ENTRANCE OF SUITE
From HENRY'S POV behind the bar, we see the guests leave
and suddenly we see Tommy in the doorway. Henry walks
around the bar and approaches Tommy.

We see James and Batts are still seated at bar with their
backs to the door.

BATTS
They're fucking mutts.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (3)
We see James nod.

BATTS
I seen them. They walk around
like big shots and they don't know
shit.

: JAMES
A guy gets half a load on. He
mouths off.

BATTS
When I was a kid, I swear on my
mother, you mouth off, you got
your fucking legs broke.
cUuT TO:
HENRY

approaching Tommy who is carrying a large folded package
under one arm.

Tommy, followed by Henry, walks over to the bar where
James and Bill Batts are talking. Tommy drops the
package on the floor.

Billy Batts looks up.

James turns around and sees that Tommy has a gun in his
hand.

James immediately grabs Batts's arms and we see Tommy
smash the gun into the side of Batts's head. We see
Tommy hit Batts again and again as James continues to
hold Batts's arms.
JAMES

(to Henry, while

pinning Batts's

arms}

Quick! Lock the door.

We see Tommy club Batts to the ground with James holding
Batts's arms.

HENRY

BATTS'S INERT FORM
on the floor.

We see Tommy unfold the package he had dropped near the
bar.

It is a plastic, flower-printed mattress cover.

Tommy and James start putting Batts's legs into the
mattress cover.

Henry is standing over them as James and Tommy struggle
to fit Batts's body in the mattress cover.

HENRY
What are we going to do with him?
We can't dump him in the street.

JAMES
(to Henry)
Bring the car ‘round back. I ‘know
a place upstate they'll never find
him. .

Tommy is looking brightly at Henry, as he and James
finally zip Batts in the mattress cover.

TOMMY
I didn't want to get blood on your
floor.

EXT. REAR DRIVEWAY - SUITE - NIGHT

Darkness. The open trunk of Henry's car. The mattress
cover is being shoved into the trunk by the three men.
It is heavy work.

HENRY
Batts's made. His whole crew is
going to be looking for him. This
is fucking bad.

TOMMY
There's a shovel at my mother's.

INT. TOMMY'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Darkness in the kitchen. We hear noise of doors opening
and tools being banged around in the dark.

TOMMY
Sshhh. You'll wake ‘er up.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

Suddenly the light in the entryway goes on, and we see
Tommy's MOTHER, in housecoat, beaming at her son and his
friends.

CUT TO:
KITCHEN TABLE

where Tommy's Mother hovers over the seated Tommy, Henry
and James. The table is filled with plates and coffee
cups and the debris of dirty dishes.

MOTHER
(to all)
Have some more. You hardly
touched anything. Did Tommy tell
you about my painting? Look.

We see her reach next to the refrigerator and pull up a
couple of oil paintings she props on the edge of the
table.

MOTHER
(proudly)
They want me to do a portrait next.
I'm gonna do the Mona Lisa.

CUT TO:
WINDOW

where we see Henry's car with the body in‘the trunk,
still parked at the curb.

INT. HENRY'S CAR - NIGHT

Finally on their way, Henry is driving. James, in the
passenger's seat, and Tommy, in the rear seat, embracing
the shovel, are dozing off. The sleepy HUMMING sound of
WHEELS is suddenly interrupted by a THUMPING sound. At
first, Henry thinks he has a flat, but the THUMPING is
too irregular. James awakens. His eyes are on Henry.
Tommy leans forward from the rear seat. Silence. THUMP!
Silence.

EXT. MERRITT PARKWAY - NIGHT

Car pulls off the road onto the grass. Henry, James and
Tommy, still holding the shovel, get cut of the car.

TOMMY
Jesus Christ! Miserable bastard!

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: 5

Henry opens the trunk and steps back. In the trunk light
we see the mattress cover squirming around. We hear
MUFFLED GROANS.

TOMMY
(raising the shovel)
Can you believe this no-good fuck?
The prick! He's still alive.
Tommy suddenly smashes the shovel into the moving, bloody
mattress cover. He smashes it again and again and again.
Cursing Batts with every swing.
TOMMY
Rat bastard.
(swings shovel)
No-good, low-life fuck.
Tommy swings shovel again and again.
Soon the mattress cover stops squirming and Tommy stops
Swinging the shovel. He is exhausted. Tommy and James
get back in the car. Henry is facing the open trunk.

TILT UP and FREEZE ON Henry's face slamming the trunk
shut.

HENRY (V.0.)
As far back as I can remember, I
always wanted to be a gangster.

States.
HENRY'S POV - GRIMY ONE-STORY CABSTAND - NIGHT 6

with faded "Pitkin Avenue Cabs" sign above the door.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: 6
It's after midnight. We see a half-dozen, immaculately-
dressed hoods wearing diamond pinky rings and silk

shirts, lounging around the cabstand talking and sipping
coffee.

HENRY (V.0.)
Even before I first wandered into
the cabstand for an-after-school
job, I knew I wanted to be a part
of them. It was there I belonged.

HENRY'S POV

We see a Cadillac pull up the to cabstand. We see the car
rise slightly when two huge, dapper hoods get out.

On hood #1 we see large diamond pinky ring on a
sausage-thick finger.

On hood #2 we see a broken-nosed hood's tie hanging
loosely across his monogrammed shirt like a silk
bandolier.

HENRY (V.0.)
To me it meant being somebody in a
neighborhood full of nobodies.

On the sidewalk we see the two hoods who just got out of
the car hug and playfully shove TUDDY VARIO, the
sloppily-dressed, solidly-built hood who runs the
cabstand.

HENRY (V.0.)
They weren't like anyone else.
They did whatever they wanted.
They'd double-park in front of
the hydrant and nobody ever gave
them a ticket. In the summer when
they played cards all night,
nobody ever called the cops.

We see Tuddy laughingly try to push them away.

HENRY (V.0.)
Tuddy Vario ran the cabstand and a
pizzeria and a few other places
for his brother, Paul, who was the
boss over everybody in the
neighborhood.

We see a laughing hood #1 slyly slip behind. Tuddy and
grab him around the neck, while hood #2 starts feigning
punches to Tuddy's ample midsection.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2) 6

Suddenly Tuddy Vario and hoods see that PAUL CICERO, the
boss, is standing in the cabstand's doorway. Cicero is a
large man, standing six-feet tall and weighing over 240
pounds. He appears even larger.

HENRY (V.0.)
Paulie might have moved slow, but
it was only because he didn't have
to move for anybody.

Tuddy and the hoods immediately stop horsing around.
TITLES CONTINUE.
INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM - MORNING 7

CARMELLA HILL, Henry's mother, shoves his books under his
arm and pushes him into the hallway. We see Henry's two
brothers putting on their jackets and picking up their
books and almost tripping over another brother's,
MICHAEL, wheelchair. We catch a glimpse of two sisters
eating breakfast.

We see Henry's construction worker father sipping coffee
in kitchen before going to work.

HENRY (V.0.)
At first, my parents loved that I
found a job across the street. My
father, who was Irish, was sent to
work at the age of eleven, and he
liked that I got myself a job. He
always said American kids were
spoiled lazy.

CARMELLA
(to the brood)
Come on. Come on. You'll all be
late.

HENRY (V.0.)
And my mother was happy after she
found out that the Ciceros came
from the same part of Sicily as
she did. To my mother, it was the
answer to her prayers.

We see Henry's mother shove him out the door with his
school books.

EXT. STREET SIDE OF DOOR - DAY 8

Carmella, in doorway, watches Henry go down the block
toward school.

When Henry turns the corner, along with other school-bound
youngsters, we see he suddenly stops. The other school
children keep walking. Henry carefully sticks his head
around the corner. His mother is no longer there.

We see Henry race across the street toward the cabstand.

HENRY (V.0.)
I was the luckiest kid in the
world.

EXT. CABSTAND - DAY to 9

We see Henry leap into the air to catch a set of car
keys.

HENRY (V.0.)
I could go anywhere.

EXT. CABSTAND PARKING LOT - DAY ‘ 10

We see Henry, who can hardly see over the, dashboard,
jockeying a mobster's Caddy around the cabstand parking
lot. We see other kids, Henry's age, watching Henry,
in awe, from behind a fence.

HENRY (V.0.)
I could do anything.

INT. CABSTAND BACKROOM - DAY . iL

We see Henry watching two uniformed cops laughing with
Tuddy. and some hoods while stuffing whiskey bottles
under their tunics.

HENRY (V.0.)
I knew everybody and everybody
Knew me.

EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE CABSTAND - DAY 12

We see Henry trying to sip hot espresso coffee just like
the big guys, except we see Henry grimace because. the
coffee is too het and far too bitter.

HENRY (V.0.)
But it wasn't too long before my
parents changed their minds. For
them, the cabstand was supposed to
be a part-time job, but for me, it
was full-time.

INT. REAR OF CABSTAND 13

Tuddy is folding and placing long sheets with policy bets
into a brown paper bag. In the b.g., we see hoods going
through boxes of stolen orange and blue cardigan sweaters.
Henry waits at Tuddy's side until Tuddy finishes making a
notation on a slip of paper. Tuddy holds the paper bag
in his hands and...

TUDDY
(to Henry, with
a smile)
Okay.
EXT. CABSTAND 14

We see Henry running out the cabstand door carrying the
paper bag. He runs past half a dozen hoods, lounging
outside on wooden chairs, wearing orange and blue
sweaters.

HENRY (V.0.)
People like my father could never
understand, but I was a part of
something. I belonged. I was
treated like a grown-up. Every
day I was learning to score.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN 15

FATHER
(in mock concern)
Did you study hard in school today?
Did you learn a lot? Huh?

Henry is silent and begins backing away.

FATHER
I can't hear you, you little liar.
(waving the letter)
I got this from the school. They
say you haven't been there in
months.

Henry tries to dart past his Father, but he cannot
escape. Henry gets a blow on the back of his head.
Henry's mother starts to interfere, but is pushed back.

FATHER
(beating Henry, but
glaring at Carmella)
Little lying bastard.
Carmella screams. Henry doubles up.

Henry's Father keeps pounding away.

CLOSE ON HENRY'S FACE
FREEZE IN ACTION ON:

HENRY'S FATHER'S FACE

HENRY (V.0.)
My father was always pissed off.
He was pissed that he had to work
so hard. He was pissed that he
made such lousy money. He was
pissed that there were seven of
us living in a tiny house. But
after a while, he was mostly
pissed that I hung around the
cabstand. He said they were bums
and that I was a bum. He said I
was going to get into trouble.
I used to say I was only running
errands after school, but he knew
better. He knew what went on at
the cabstand and, every once in
a while, usually after he got his
load on, I had to take a beating.
But by then, I didn't care. No
matter how many beatings I took,
I wouldn't listen to what he said.
I don't think I even heard him.
The way I saw it, everybody has
to take a beating some time.

UNFREEZE and continue the beating.

Him?
HENRY
No.

There. That's him. That's the guy.

Hood #1 and Hood #2 get out of the car and grab the
stunned MAILMAN. He loses his hat and spills some mail
as they shove him into the car's rear seat.

INT. NEIGHBORHOOD PIZZERIA 18

Tuddy Vario is standing in front of a pizza oven. Henry
watches the Hoods shove the Mailman against the side of
the oven. We see Paul Cicero in the b.g.

There are hoods standing around him at a respectful dis-
tance. Only Tuddy approaches him with ease.

We see a hood talk to Tuddy. We see Tuddy relay the
message to Paul. We see Paul say something to Tuddy,
who nods back to the hood and then motions to Henry to
come over. We see Tuddy bend down a little and whisper
in Henry's ear.

DOLLY IN ON Paul's face.

HENRY (V.0.)
Hundreds of guys depended on
Paulie and he got a piece of
everything they made. It was
tribute, just like the old country,
except they were doing it in
America. All they got from Paulie
was protection from other guys
looking to rip them off. That's
what it's all about. That's what
the F.B.I. can never understand --
that what Paulie and the organization
does is offer protection for people
who can't go to the cops. They're
like the police department for
wiseguys.

EXT. USED CAR LOT - NIGHT 20

We see Tuddy in his car, hand Henry a hammer, some rags,
and a five gallon can of gasoline.

TUDDY
(driving away)
I'll be up at the corner.

We see Henry BREAK the WINDOWS of about six cars parked
facing the sidewalk.

HENRY (V.0.)
People looked at me differently.
They knew I was with somebody.

We see Henry shove the gas-soaked rags through the
broken car windows. Henry looks up the block where
Tuddy has parked. We see Tuddy (from Henry's POV) look
around and nod. Henry immediately begins tossing
lighted matchbooks through the smashed car windows.

HENRY (V.0.)
I didn't have to wait on line at
the bakery on Sunday morning
anymore for fresh bread. The
owner knew who I was with, and
he'd come from around the counter,
no matter how many people were
waiting. I was taken care of first.

Suddenly the night EXPLODES in orange brightness. We
see Henry begin to run toward Tuddy's car as the cars
he has ignited begin to EXPLODE behind him.

HENRY (V.0.)}
Our neighbors didn't park in our
driveway anymore, even though we
didn't have a car. At thirteen,
I was making more money than most
of the grownups in the neighborhood.
I had more money than I could spend.
I had it all.

FREEZE ON Henry's silhouette against the darkness like a
man in hell.

HENRY (V.0.)
One day some of the kids from the
neighborhood carried my mother's
groceries all the way home for her.
It was out of respect.

Henry's mother opens door of house, bright daylight.

MOTHER'S POV
She sees grey lizard shoes, grey pinstriped trousers,
grey silk shirt, Billy Eckstein collar, yellow silk tie,
and double-breasted jacket. She looks up and sees
Henry's smiling face.
MOTHER (0.S.)

My God! You look like a gangster.

22 EXT. PIZZERIA - DAY 22
We see Henry standing near front of store.

MAN
(screaming)
I've been shot! Help! Help!

TUDDY
(from rear of store,
to Henry)
Close the door. Don't let him in,

Henry grabs a chair, takes it outside for the man to sit
on. and closes the pizzeria door.

The man collapses in the seat and Henry immediately
starts wrapping the man's shredded and bleeding hand in
his apron. The man is turning white and praying.

HENRY
(soothing the man)
It's okay. It's okay. They're
getting an ambulance.

We see Henry prop the man in his chair and race into
the pizzeria for more aprons which he takes outside and
wraps around the man's bleeding hand, just as an ambu-
lance pulls up.

We see Tuddy come up behind Henry as the man is rushed
away.

HENRY (V.0.)
It was the first time I had ever
seen anyone shot.

TUDDY
(angry)
You're some fucking jerk.

We see that Henry is stunned.

TUDDY
You wasted eight fucking aprons on
- that guy.
HENRY (V.0.)

I remember feeling bad about the
guy. But I remember feeling that
maybe Tuddy was right. I knew
Paulie didn't want anybody dying
in the building.

Henry is making a ham and cheese sandwich. CAMERA

THROUGH professional card dealers skittering cards across
green felt tables, THROUGH bodyguards watching the door,
THROUGH Tuddy Vario walking around the tables, THROUGH
Paul Cicero standing quietly on the side, THROUGH Henry
giving the sandwich to one of the players.

HENRY (V.0.)
It was a glorious time. Wiseguys
were all over the place. It was
before Apalachin and before Crazy
Joey decided to take on a boss and
start a war. It was when I met
the world. It was when I first met
James Conway.

CAMERA COMES TO REST when James Conway walks in the door.
CUT TO:

HENRY
looking at James.

HENRY (V.0.)
He couldn't have been more than
twenty-four or twenty-five at the
time, but he was already a legend.
He'd walk in the door and everybody
who worked the room went wild.
He'd give the doorman a hundred
just for opening the door. He
shoved hundreds in the pockets of
the dealers and who ran the games.
The bartender got a hundred just
for keeping the ice cubes cold.

Henry sees Cicero give Conway a hug around the shoulder.
Henry sees James handing money to the doorman. Henry
watches players timidly move their chairs slightly to
make room for James. Henry sees James pull out a wad
of bills and sit down.

JAMES
(to Henry, who is
standing near
the bar)
Hey, kid! Get me a seven and seven.

We see Henry make the drink and bring it to James.
Cicero is standing next to James.

Keep ‘em coming.

FREEZE FRAME ON James.

HENRY (V.0.)

James was one of the most feared
guys in the city. He was first
locked up at eleven and was doing
hits for mob bosses when he was
sixteen. Hits never bothered him.
It was business. But what he
really loved to do was steal. I
mean, he actually enjoyed it.
James was the kind of guy who
rooted for the bad guys in the
movies. He was one of the city's
biggest hijackers. Clothes.
Razor blades. Booze. Cigarettes,
Shrimp and lobsters. Shrimp and
lobsters were the best. They went
ast.

EXT. TRAILER TRUCK (NEAR IDLEWILD AIRPORT) - NIGHT 24

The trailer truck is stopped at a light in a deserted
area near JFK Airport. We see the driver being quietly
led to a car where James Conway is standing. We see
James routinely take the driver's wallet. There is
absolutely no resistance.

HENRY (V.0.)

And almost all of them were
gimmie's.

James and Tommy DeVito, a youngster about Henry's age,

is very nattily dressed in a sharply-cut suit and highly
buffed shoes.

James and Tommy are loading the cartons into the arms of
a woman SCHOOL-CROSSING GUARD who is having difficulty
carrying the load.

JAMES
Tommy. Help the lady.

We see Tommy scramble down from the truck and help the
School-Crossing Guard to her own car where we see she
already had a load of the cartons.

We see Henry standing near her car and watching.

We see Henry busily selling. cartons to workers. Tommy
is getting cartons out of the trunk of a car parked
nearby. Henry is so busy he can hardly keep the money
and cash straight. Instead of the neat roll we saw on
James, Henry's cash is a wrinkled mess. Some of it is
rolled, some folded, some in different pockets. We see
Henry approached by two city DETECTIVES.

DETECTIVE #1
What do you think you're doing?

DETECTIVE #2
Where did you get these cigarettes?

HENRY
, (offering them cartons)
It's okay.

Detective #1 roughly grabs Henry's arm. Detective #2
grabs Henry's cigarette cartons, We see Henry pull his
arm away and one. of the Detectives slaps him across

the face.

We see that Tommy is about to say something, but runs
away instead.

INT. COURTROOM - "AR-1" (ARRAIGNMENT PART 1) 28

Henry is waiting along with dozens of hookers, nodding
junkies, muggers and shoplifters. When Henry's case is
called, we PAN TO a well-dressed mob lawyer. Henry, who
has never seen the lawyer before, walks to the
prosecutor's, rather than the defendant's table. A court
clerk nods him over toward his own lawyer.

We see DRIVER get out of truck with ENGINE still RUNNING

respond and the Driver casually walks toward the diner.

HENRY (V.0.)
If any of the truckers or airlines
gave us trouble, Paulie had his
union people scare them with a
little strike. It was beautiful.
It was an even bigger money-maker
than numbers, and James was in
charge. Whenever we needed money,
we'd rob the airport. To us, it
was better than Citibank.

INT. TABLE IN DINER 32

We see Driver rise from debris of breakfast dishes, leave
a tip and pay the cashier. He walks out the door toward
his truck in the parking lot.

HOLD ON the door.

Driver rushes back in through the door toward the
cashier.

DRIVER
(flushed and
agitated)
Hurry, gimme the phone. Two
niggers just stole my truck.

INT, SONNY BUNZ'S LOUNGE - DUSK 33

A cavernous room within earshot of the airport that looks

the Bunz Lounge it's always the middle of the night.

CAMERA TRACKS PAST the zebra-striped banquettes and bar
stools, past sharpy businessmen, bookmakers and hoods.

HENRY (V.0.)
There was James and Tommy and me.
And there was Anthony Stabile,
Franky Carbone, Fat Andy, Frankie

We see Henry look at his watch and look at the lounge's
entrance. .

HENRY (V.0.)
For us to live any other way was
nuts. To us, those goody-good
people who worked shitty jobs
for bum paychecks, who took the
subway to work every day and
worried about their bills, were
dead. They were suckers. They
had no balls. If we wanted
something, we just took it. If
anyone complained twice, they
got hit so bad they never
complained again. It was routine.

unloaded and delivered into the front door.

HENRY (V.0.)

He can go to Paulie. Trouble with

We see Henry and two hoods from cabstand checking the
cases of liquor being delivered into the lounge. The
entire room is filled floor to ceiling with cases of
whiskey, wine, crates of lobster, and shrimp, and
stacks of table linen and sides of beef. The place
looks like a warehouse.

HENRY (V.0.)
But now the guy has got to come

Fuck you, pay me. You had a fire?

INT. BUNZ LOUNGE OFFICE 38

Henry, James and Tommy are standing around the small

denuded of furniture. A lawyer is going over papers.

A terrified, unshaven Sonny Bunz is seated behind the
desk. The lawyer is showing him where to sign.

We see Henry deftly steer Karen away from the Copa’s main
entrance and down the basement steps. A huge bodyguard,
eating a sandwich in the stairwell gives Henry a big
"hello." We see Henry walk right through the basement
kitchen, which is filled with Chinese and Latino cooks
and dishwashers who pay no attention. Karen is being
dragged along, open-mouthed, at the scene. Henry starts
up a stained kitchen staircase through a pair of swinging
doors and suddenly Karen sees she is inside the main
room. The harried maitre d’ (he is surrounded by
customers clamoring for their tables) waves happily at
Henry and signals to a CAPTAIN. We see a table held
aloft by two waiters wedging their way toward the stage
and plant the table smack in front of what had until that
moment been a ringside table. As Henry leads Karen to
their seat, she sees that he is nodding and shaking

hands with many of the other guests. We see Henry
quietly slip twenty dollar bills to the waiters.

With absolutely no warning, Henry reaches out and grabs
Bruce's hair with one hand and pulls his gun out of his
waistband with the other. In almost one motion, Henry
smashes the gun across Bruce's face. Teeth fall from
Bruce's mouth. The two brothers, still not seeing the
gun, start toward Henry, but Henry continues to pound the
gun into Bruce's face like a dinner gong. Bruce's head
is still off the ground only because Henry refuses to let
go of his hair. Bruce's brothers realize Henry has a

Paulie, you shouldn't.

We see that Cicero's envelope is richly embossed with

hearts and flowers and has a clear window in front
through which she can see several neatly-folded hundred
dollar bills. When Karen looks up, she sees that every

wiseguy and his wife are lined up before her and that
they are all holding envelopes with clear windows in

KAREN
He's a grown man. He doesn't have

‘do stuff with the: wrong people.
They don't have things organized.
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. That's who. And /

fall asleep in the getaway car. .

Karen looks down. She’s listening.

HENRY
Listen, we're beginning to make
real money for the first time.
It's business. Do you think I'm
going to walk away from that?

Henry puts his arm around Karen and begins to hug her.

KAREN (V.0.)
After a while, it all got to be
normal. None of it seemed like
crimes. It was more that Henry
was enterprising. That he and the
guys were making a few bucks
hustling, while other men were
sitting on their asses waiting for
handouts. Our husbands weren't
brain surgeons. They were blue
collar guys, and the only way they
could get extra money, real extra
money, was to go out and cut a few
corners.

There was always a little
harassment. They always wanted to
talk to Henry about this or that.
They'd come with their subpoenas
and warrants and make me sign.
But mostly they were just looking
for a handout. A few bucks to
keep things quiet, not matter what
they found.

Henry looks at his pals, orders his last Screaming Eagle

see that his WIFE is wearing a $30,000 sable coat.

JAMES
Jesus Christ! Are you all fucking
nuts?
CARBONE
(to Henry)

What's the matter with him?

Before Henry can answer, we see James start to grab the
coat off MRS. CARBONE'S back.

Cabone's back and begin to roll it up and shove it under
Carbone's arm.

JAMES

(furiously, to Carbone)
Didn't I tell you not to get
anything big? Didn't I tell you
not to attract attention? In two
days, one fuck buys a Caddy and
another buys a.ten thousand dollar
mink.

(to Henry}
Can you believe this shit?

(to Carbone, with

Some menace)
Now get the fuck home and get rid
ef the coat. Bring it back to
where you got it. I don't care
what you do, just get rid of it.

MRS. CARBONE
(to Carbone, hysterical
and angry)
I'm not giving it back. Franky?
Do you hear me?

We see Carbone angrily grab his wife's arm and leave.

CARBONE
Did I tell you to shut up? Shut up!

JAMES

walk toward the bar)
Fucking guys. Can you believe
them. I told them all: Don't
attract attention. Act normal.

At the bar, we see Stacks Edwards and his girlfriend drop-
ping shot glasses of green creme de menthe into large
glasses of chilled Dom Perignon. Tommy and his girl-for-

Tommy is wearing a shiny silk suit that practically glows
with newness. We see Frenchy and Buddha with their wives.
Everyone is dressed in new clothes and flashing gaudy

HENRY (V.0.)
James was cutting every link
between himself and the robbery,
but it had nothing to do with me.
I gave James the tip and he gave
me some Christmas money. From
then on I kept my mouth shut. I
knew James. He had the cash. It
was his. I know he kicked some
money upstairs to Paulie, but
that was it. It made him sick
to have to turn money over to the
guys who stole it. He'd rather
whack them. Anyway, what did I
care? I wasn't asking for
anything and, besides, James was
making nice money with me through
my Pittsburgh connections.

A bright sunny afternoon, Henry and James seated in a

Sausages and toasted English muffins.

HENRY (V.0.)
Still, I never saw James so happy.
He was like a kid. We had money
coming in through my Pittsburgh
people and after a while even the
Lufthansa thing began to calm
down. But the thing that made
James so happy that morning was
that this was the day Tommy was
being made.

HENRY (V.0.)
It's the highest honor they can
give you. It means you belong to
a family and a crew. It means
that nobody can fuck around with
you. It also means you can fuck
around with anybody, as long as
they aren't also a member. It's

When James turns around, we see that he is crying.
We see Henry hurrying toward James to console him.

HENRY (V.0.)
And there was nothing we could do.
Batts was a made man and Tommy
wasn't. We had to sit still and
take it. It was among the
Italians. It was real greaseball
shit. They even shot Tommy in the
face so his mother couldn't give
him an open coffin at the funeral.

It's my lucky hat. I never fly

Do you realize what we're involved

LOIS
I don't care. I need my hat. I

EXT. HENRY'S DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 136

We see Henry and Lois get into his car. As they start to
move out of the driveway, Henry notices that there is a
traffic jam in front of his property. People are walking
around with flashlights. It looks like ‘an accident.
Suddenly, a MAN in Windbreaker appears at Henry's window
and jams a gun against Henry's head.

MAN
One move, motherfucker, and I'll
blow you away.

HENRY (V.0.)
For a second 1 thought I was dead,
but when I heard all the noise, I
knew they were cops. Only cops
talk that way. If they had been
wiseguys, I wouldn't have heard

caliber gun, lift her dress and, grimacing, shove the
cold metal into her underpants.

CUT TO:
INT. FBI OFFICE 138

Henry is seated and surrounded by FBI Men and PROSECUTOR
EDWARD MCDONALD. We see Lois Byrd brought in past Henry
and ushered into another room. We see the Dealer ushered
past Henry and placed into yet another room.

HENRY (V.0.)
All day I thought the guys in the
helicopter were just local cops
busting my balls over Lufthansa,
but they turned out to be Narks.
They had been on me a month.
Phone taps. Surveillance.

We see Sandy brought in, followed by two cops carrying
cardboard boxes filled with pots, sieves and scales from
Sandy's table. The cops put the boxes on a table where
Henry can see them. We see one of the Narks lick his
finger after wiping it across one of the bowls. He smiles
at Henry and rolls his eyes.

We see Henry slouch further in his seat while questioning
continues.

INT. PRISON VISITING AREA 139

We see Karen and Henry seated at a table in a visiting

HENRY (V.0.)
Karen finally got her mother to
put her house up for my bail. I
was out.

We see Karen and her mother are waiting in the car.

HENRY (V.0.)
I remember I had this feeling I
was going to get killed right
outside the jail. I knew Paulie
was still pissed at me and he's
such a hothead I was afraid he
might have me whacked before he
calmed down. And I was also
worried about James. James knew
if Paulie found out he was in the
drug deals with me, Paulie would
have James killed even before me.
This is the bad time. I didn't
feel safe until I got. home.

I was depending on that money.

INT. GEFFKEN'S BAR 145

The place is closed, but inside we see Paul Cicero in the
kitchen cooking peppers and eggs in a frying pan with
olive oil. We see several hoods surrounding him at a
distance. Various supplicants, a local butcher, an old
lady, etc., wait for a papal audience.

CICERO
(looking down)
I warned you a million times.

HENRY
I've been all fucked up since I
got out.

CICERO

You think I didn't know what you
were doing?

‘ HENRY

It was easy money. I did it in
the can. Shit! I learned the
junk business in the can, Paulie.

CICERO
Right in my face. You looked in
my face and you lied.

HENRY
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe
me. I was fucking crazy. But I'm
okay now. I can be trusted. I'm
clean now. On my children.
Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey
waiting for bail got my head

together.

CICERO
You thought I was some fucking
jerk?

HENRY

Paulie, I couldn't come to you.
I didn't want to put you in this
shit.

KAREN

James. I don't know. I got so
much else on my mind. I got the
kids. We got no money.

JAMES
I gotta talk to him as soon as
I can.

KAREN

He says he's too hot. He doesn't
even know I came here today.
It's like he's crazy, James.

JAMES
I know. I know. But it'll be
okay. Don't worry. I got some
money for you. It's down the

We see Karen's CAR SCREECH to a halt near the garage as
Henry comes racing out of the house toward her. He has
a gun pressed close to his side.

We see Karen is frozen to the wheel in fear. She is
visibly shaking, crying.

We see Henry very gently pull her from behind the wheel.
He has cradled her in his arms as, after a wary look
around the street, Henry walks her toward the house.

INT. SHERWOOD DINER - LATE MORNING 149
CAMERA MOVES IN ON table.
HENRY'S POV - LONG TRACKING SHOT THROUGH RESTAURANT

You don't know what you're tracking until you see all the
food on the table and James looks up.

HENRY (V.0.)
If you're part of a crew, nobody
ever tells you that they're going
to kill you. It doesn't happen
that way. There aren't any
arguments or curses like in the
movies. Your murderers come with
smiles. They come as your friends,
the people who have cared for you
all your life, and they always
come at a time when you are at
your. weakest and most in need of
their help. So I met James in a
crowded place we both knew. I got
there fifteen minutes early and I
saw that James was already there.
He took the booth near the window
so he could see everyone who
drove up to the restaurant. He
wanted to see if I had been
tailed.

James stands to embrace Henry. We see a table with
melon, eggs, sausage, toasted English muffins, etc.
Henry notices that James has not touched any of the
food. Next to James, we see a large legal folder.

JAMES
(smiling, friendly
greeting)
You look good.

HENRY
(shaking his head)
I didn't need the headache.

Come on, eat something.

On the surface, of course, everything
was supposed to be fine. We were
supposed to be discussing my case,
just like we always would, but I had
a feeling James was trying to sense
whether I was going to rat him out
to save my neck.

JAMES .
(patting the legal
folder)
I think you got a good shot at
beating the case.
HENRY
How?

JAMES
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh.
He rated you all out. He's been a
rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.

HENRY
Yeah.

JAMES
He's hiding, the son of a bitch,
in Florida.

HENRY
Yeah.

I want you and Anthony to go down

Without him, they've got no case.
