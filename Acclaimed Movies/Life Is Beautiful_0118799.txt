This is a simple story but not an easy one to tell. Like a fable,
there is sorrow, and like a fable, it is full of wonder and
happiness.

TITLE CARD
Arezzo, Italy
1919

SCENE 1

Under a beautiful, crystalline sky, a Balilla convertible piled high with luggage makes its smooth,
happy way through the placid Tuscan hills. FERRUCCIO, a plump young man with a jovial—
almost boyish—look about him is driving. His friend, GUIDO, is in the passenger seat. He hugs
the wheel as he recites lines of verse in a clear, bucolic tone.

FERRUCCIO
I sing what I see
Nothing gets by me.

He raises his voice as the car picks up speed, flying downhill.

FERRUCCIO
“Here I am,” said I to chaos, “I am your slave!” “Good!” “For
what,” said I, “free in the end am I! What good is a caress when
bliss...this man came to possess?”

«_. Here | am, ready, the trains are gone, the brakes are gone and
Tcan resist no more....Go sweet Bacchus, take me...the brakes
are gone, oh...”

{in a higher, worried voice)
The brakes are gone!

His friend says, from under his hat,

GUIDO
Theard you!

FERRUCCIO
No, the brakes! They’re really gone! Hit the brakes!

And he furiously kicks the dead brake pedal. At the first curve the car nearly goes off the road.
Guido bounces like a spring and grabs the rolls of upholstery fabric, the car seats, the suitcases.

GUIDO
Weren't you reciting a poem?
FERRUCCIO
It doesn’t work.

GUIDO
Brake! We're going to die! The woods! Brake!

Guido pulls the hand brake, but it’s broken and nothing happens. Meanwhile, the car is gathering
speed. It takes a sharp curve, goes off.the road,.and bounces down into a field, cutting the bushes
in its path. Guido falls backward onto the uphoistery rolls. A bump on the ground snaps the trunk
open and two rolls of expensive fabric—one white, one gold—unravel and sweep the grass just
as the car plunges into a tangled grove of thick flowering bramble bushes, ivy, and laurel, and
comes out the other side completely covered in branches, leaves, and flowers. The windshield is
covered in twigs and leaves. Poor Ferruccio is now driving blind. Guido stands up, holding on
wherever he can, grabbing the windshield and looking ahead, trying to guide his friend.

SCENE 2
A PAVED ROAD RUNNING THROUGH A VILLAGE—EXT., DAY

MAN #1
The king is coming.

WOMAN #1
There he is!

GUIDO
It’s full of people down there.

In fact, beyond the long curve the road straightens and runs through a village where a local festival is
in progress, complete with a band and Royalist and Fascist Youth banners and placards. When the
crowd of locals, waiting in the shadow of a dais and holding placards that say LONG LIVE THE KING,
see Guido and Ferruccio’s extravagantly “decorated car” and the motorcycle escort approach, they
begin to applaud. The band strikes up the Royal March, and adults and children salute the “king”
as he passes. Guido, his arm held high and stiff, shouts into the festive pandemonium.

GUIDO
We have no brakes! Move!

His gesture is mistaken for the Fascist salute. The villagers raise their arms and shout loud and
strong,‘Long live the king!” The car, festooned with flowers and with its train of white and gold
fabric, zooms through town and disappears into a curve at the bottom of the road. The crowd of
villagers breaks onto the asphalt, saluting the car as it disappears and forcing the royal car, a
convertible which has appeared (and in which are seated, in plain sight, His Majesty and the
queen), to stop short. The king’s chauffeur, honking the limousine’s hom, drives the car slowly
through the incredulous crowd.
SCENE 3
A COUNTRY ROAD; A FARM—EXT., DAY

The Balilla, free of branches and colorful “drapings,” stands dead under the sun in the middle of
a dusty dirt road. Guido and Ferruccio are on their backs under the car, trying to repair the
damage. Their voices are heard.

FERRUCCIO (from under the car)
Go for a walk. Otherwise we won’t get there until tomorrow.

GUIDO
I found the screw. Now what do you need?

FERRUCCIO
Nothing, I need ten minutes alone.

GUIDO
All right, I'll leave you alone. Do you want the screw from
before?

FERRUCCIO
No, I want to be alone.

GUIDO
Do I toss out the screw if I find it?

Guido, looking straight ahead as he walks away from the car, notices his black greasy hands.

GUIDO
I'm going to wash my hands.

There is an old farmhouse nearby, surrounded by an orchard and barn. Three cows, two white
and one black, are tied to a fence. The black cow is next to a water pump. Guido walks up to the
pump, hangs his coat and hat on a branch, and begins to pump water. Whistling, he fills a pail
and washes his hands in the pail water, which immediately turns black. Nearby, a little girl is
milking a white cow. Drying his hands in the air, Guido walks up to her. A horse is hitched to a
wagon filled with baskets of vegetables and flowers. Guido, curious, takes a good look. He is
happy, playful.

GUIDO
Hello, little girl. Where’s your mother? Is she the one who
loaded this wagon?

ELEONORA
No, the landlady did.

 
GUIDO
Is it a market? Where's your mother? How old are you? ‘What's

your name?
ELEONORA
Eleonora.
Guido bows graciously.
GUIDO
Nice to meet you, I’m Prince Guido!
ELEONORA
Prince?
GUIDO

Yes, I’m a prince. All this is mine, this principiant is the prince’s
principiate. We'll name the place Addis Ababa. Out with the
cows, in with the camels!

ELEONORA
Camels?

GUIDO
Even a few hippopotamus! I have to go. I have an appointment
with the princess.

ELEONORA
When?

GUIDO
Now!

Someone cries out.

DORA’S VOICE

Ah!

Just above Guido’s head, in the hayloft, a girl has been stung by a wasp. She loses her balance
and falls out the window into Guido’s arms as pigeons flap their way noisily out of the loft
window. Guido and Dora fall down, rolling on straw. She is on top of him, a veil over her face.

GUIDO (laughing)
Good morning, Princess!

DORA
How frightening. I almost killed myself. Did I hurt you?

 
GUIDO
I've never been better. Do you always leave the house like this?

DORA
J was trying to burn out a wasps’ nest...but ] got stung.

She tums over onto her side. The veil falls from her face. She rubs her thigh, just above her knee.
Guido is lying next to her.

GUIDO
A wasp stung you? Here? Allow me! Hold still, Princess.

He takes her hand off her thigh, bends over, puts his mouth over the wasp sting. Hé sucks and
spits.

GUIDO
You have to get the poison out right away, it’s very dangerous!
SPITS
Lie down, Princess.
SPITS
It'll take a while.
SPITS

Smiling, she backs away and stands up. He stands, too.

DORA
It’s fine now, thank you.

GUIDO
Did you get stung anywhere else?

She picks her mosquito-net hat up off the ground.

DORA
No, thank you.

Looking up at the sky, Guido laughs.
GUIDO
What kind of place is this? It’s beautiful: Pigeons fly, women
fall from the sky! I’m moving here!

ELEONORA
It’s all his! He wants to fill it with camels. He’s a prince!

She approaches the pail. Dora is shy and embarrassed, but very curious about this frisky fellow.

 
GUIDO
( Exactly. Prince Guido at your service, Princess!

With these words, he bows the deepest of bows. Dora smiles, while from the road the Balilla’s
hom sounds.

GUIDO
(TQ FERRUCCIO)
T’'m coming!

GUIDO
(TO DORA)
Good-bye then.
He puts his jacket on and hides a stick behind his back. He tums as he puts his hat on.

DORA
How can I thank you?

GUIDO
There’s no need. If you really want to thank me I'll take some
eggs to make a nice omelette for my squire.

DORA
Take whatever you want. It’s all yours.

GUIDO
Thank you! I’ll take two...six. All right! I'll make a nice
omelette.

Then, as a farewell gesture, be raises his hat with the stick he has hidden behind his back.

GUIDO
Good-bye Eleonora. My regards, Princess. Farewell.

The horn sounds as the car starts moving. Guido walks quickly toward his friend, who is waiting
behind the wheel.

GUIDO (walking away)
Here I am, Nuvolari....It’s eggs for us tonight! All camels here!

The car is on its way again. Dora and Eleonora watch, smiling.

SCENE 4
THE CITY; UNCLE’S HOUSE—EXT., NIGHT

Night has fallen. The Balilla crosses some city streets, a square, and enters a long boulevard. The
car’s headlights illuminate ancient monuments and some sinister images of the regime.
Ferruccio’s and Guido’s voices are heard.

FERRUCCIO
‘Where is this house, anyway?

GUIDO
‘We're almost there. Turn left.

FERRUCCIO
Is your uncle sleeping here too with us?

GUIDO
No, he’s been living in the hotel for thirty years. He’s loaning us
this house. He uses it for storage. There, we're here. That’s my
uncle’s horse, Robin Hood. That’s my uncle’s buggy and that’s
my uncle’s house. And he’s inside.
Guido gets out of the car.

GUIDO
Hello dear uncle, here we are! Hurry, it’s late. Here we are. The
car broke down!
Before he finishes speaking, the front door suddenly bursts open. Guido is pushed backward and
bumps into Ferruccio. Three young men hurriedly push their way out of Guido’s uncle’s house
and run off, pushing Guido and Ferruccio out of their way and shouting.

GUIDO AND FERRUCCIO
Oh! What's happening? Who are they?

Guido hurries into the house, calling.

GUIDO
Uncle!

Ferruccio enters right behind him.
SCENE 5
UNCLE’S HOUSE—INT., NIGHT

Guido’s UNCLE is on the ground, disheveled and out of breath. He’s trying to stand up. His
nephew helps him.
GUIDO
Uncle!

His uncle wants no fuss. He stands up with a few groans of pain, but then smiles immediately.

UNCLE
Barbarians!

GUIDO
‘What happened. Who were those guys?

UNCLE
Never mind. Barbarians.

Meanwhile, Ferruccio is gathering up pieces of a broken vase. This isn’t a house, it’s

a damp, cold warehouse. The old man is a collector of antiques, which are heaped carelessly in
every room. Six or seven chandeliers hang from the ceiling, but only one is lit, and it lights up a
bureau and assorted furniture covered with protective rags

and blankets.

GUIDO
Are you hurt? Why didn’t you cry for help?

UNCLE
Silence is the loudest cry! Come here, you two.

Guido’s uncle is an elderly gentleman with a very refined manner and gestures. He is wearing a
dark sport coat. He takes a long, hard look at Ferruccio.

UNCLE
This is your poet friend, right?

FERRUCCIO (intimidated)
Yes, I’m Ferruccio. I’m also an upholsterer.

UNCLE (moving)
Excellent! Come with me....all knickknacks here...an old
passion that’s a knickknack itself.

He pushes a switch and the light goes on in another room, which is also filled with old stuff. In
one comer a double bed has been made.

FERRUCCIO
Madonna...what’s all this stuff for?

Uncle pretends not to hear.
UNCLE
You can stay here as long as you like.

(to Guido)
I'll tell you right off, it’s not easy to be a waiter! There's the bed.
Legend says Garibaldi slept here.

He suddenly tums to-Ferruccio.

UNCLE
Nothing is more necessary than the superfluous!

Then he tums toward his nephew as he opens the bathroom door.

UNCLE
The Town Hall is on Sestani Street, turn right after the
colonnade. You can go tomorrow morning. This is the bathroom;
with the appropriate invention of M. Bidet.

He closes the bathroom door and walks past a bookshelf.
UNCLE
‘There are a few books here, including a Life of Petrarch by
Lorenzo Paolino. The kitchen’s there...and here's a velocipede,
commonly called a bike.
He goes toward the front door.
UNCLE
It’s late, I have to get back to the hotel. There’s only one key, so
don’t lose it...it’s hanging on the door. It’s good to see you. I’m
coming, Robin Hood.
He goes outside.

FERRUCCIO (admiringly)
What an uncle!

SCENE 6
THE CITY; LOCAL STREETS—EXT., DAY
A sunny moming. Guido and Ferruccio are walking through the city. They are happy and full of

hope. Their heads turn left to right as they observe everything. Every now and then, Guido does a
funny step.
10

GUIDO
No one pays attention here. Isn’t it great? If you feel like doing
something, you do it. You want to let yourself go, you want to
yell? Yell!

Ferruccio doesn’t wait to be asked twice: He suddenly shouts, at full throat,

FERRUCCIO (shouts)
Eeeeeh!

Several heads turn, startled.

GUIDO
What're you, crazy? You think you're in the country where you
can do as you please? This is the city!
You’ve been yelling like a madman for three hours! You can’t
- yell.

Just then, a man in work clothes with a basket of fruit in hand shouts up at an open window on
the third floor of the building.

WORKMAN (shouting)
Maria! The key!

A second later the enormous key to the front door falls from above, almost landing on the two
friends, who get out of the way just in time.

GUIDO
You see? You can’t yell.

SCENE 7
UPHOLSTERY SHOP—INT., DAY.

Twins six or seven years of age are bouncing on an old, broken-down sofa. It is a nice uphoistery
shop, filled with fabric, cushions, drapery, rugs, and mattresses. The owner is tall and hardy, a
good-natured man. Guido and Ferruccio are standing in front of him, paying attention to what
he’s saying.

UPHOLSTERER (to Ferruccio)
If you got alll that poetry out of your head you’d make your father
very happy and you’d make more money than he!

GUIDO
Right, Oreste! That’s what I keep telling him—you have to settle
down.

He spies a handsome hat on the counter, takes his own off, and puts the other on.
oa

1

GUIDO
How does it look on me?

The upholsterer puts the hats back where they belong.

UPHOLSTERER
Nice, but it’s mine!

FERRUCCIO
So when do I start work?

UPHOLSTERER
Right now. You're already late.

He points to an armchair.

UPHOLSTERER
Take that chair down to the workshop.

‘When he tums, Guido exchanges the hats again.

GUIDO
I’m going to the Town Hall. See you later.

He extends his hand to the upholsterer for a handshake, tipping his hat slightly. The upholsterer
laughs, stops him, and exchanges the hats again. Guido’s own hat is back on his head.

UPHOLSTERER
Yeah, see you later. And behave yourselves. These are hard
times, very hard.

GUIDO
Hard times, huh?

Ferruccio is moving the armchair.

GUIDO
What do you think of the political situation?

Just then the twins pull a curtain down.

UPHOLSTERER
Benito! Adolf! Behave!

He tums to Guido.

UPHOLSTERER
‘What did you say?
12

GUIDO
Uh, I was saying——okay, okay, so long!

Ferruccio is pulling an armchair along the floor. The upholsterer turns to him.

UPHOLSTERER
You'll break the legs that way.

Guido sneaks another hat change, and leaves the shop with the upholsterer’s hat on his head.

GUIDO
See you later!

The upholsterer tums, suspicious, and sees Guido’s old hat on the counter instead of his own new
one. He grabs it and runs to the door, but he is too jate. He returns inside the shop with an evil
grin.

UPHOLSTERER
He got away with it! But I’ll find him.
He turns
Benito, you’re going to get a smack!
SCENE 8

TOWN HALL—INT., DAY

Itis a large office on the second floor of a small building, with two large open windows that
overlook the street. Flowerpots are on the windowsill. Guido is seated in front of the secretary’s
desk. She is a polite, older woman. She dips her pen into the inkwell.

GUIDO
I would like to fill out all the necessary forms to open a
bookstore. Will it take long?

SECRETARY
Years.

GUIDO
So we better start now.

SECRETARY (checking her watch)
Now? It's nearly one, we're closing soon. Come back this
afternoon.

GUIDO

Ican’t, my uncle has to give me waitering lessons. ~
13

SECRETARY
Then come back tomorrow. In the meantime, you have to fill out
a formal application which our town clerk has to sign...

She gestures toward the door behind her, beyond which is a young man who is putting on his
jacket, getting ready to leave. Guido stands up, but as he moves he remembers that the eggs from
yesterday are still in his pockets. He takes them out slowly.

GUIDO
Oh, Lord, the eggs. We nearly had a real omelette here.

Holding three eggs in his hand, he keeps talking to the secretary.
GUIDO
Fill it out, we’ll get him to sign right away. Write: The
undersigned, Orefice, Guido, hereby applies...

SECRETARY (interrupting)
But he can’t sign it immediately!

‘The town clerk, hat on his head and briefcase in hand, comes out of his office. It is DR.
RODOLFO, an elegant young man with broad shoulders and a smiling, congenial air about him.

GUIDO
Here he is, here he is!

DR. RODOLFO
What's going on here?

He is about to speak to the secretary, but Guido butts in.

GUIDO
I need your signature to open my bookstore.

Rodolfo stares at the stranger with eggs in his hand and tums to the secretary.

DR. RODOLFO
Signorina, what is going on?

SECRETARY
Dr. Rodolfo, I told him, but he insists!

GUIDO
Dr. Rodolfo, one little signature!

DR. RODOLFO
I can’t. My replacement will be here in an hour, ask him.
14

GUIDO
But it’s just a signature, right?

DR. RODOLFO
We close at one. Got it?

He tums and strides out. Guido looks at the clock.

GUIDO
But it’s only ten to one!

DR. RODOLFO
File a complaint!

With the town clerk gone, Guido, eggs still in hand, goes to the window and says to the secretary,

GUIDO .
Okay, I'll file a complaint. The undersigned, Orefice, Guido...
(HE CHANGES TONE)
‘What a nasty guy, huh? So when is his replacement due? Jes—

Leaning on the windowsill, he accidentally overturns one of the flowerpots, which falls out the
window. He looks out...

SCENE 9
TOWN HALL—EXT., DAY

The flowerpot, dropping from the second floor, falls smack on Rodolfo’s head as he exits the
town hall doors. He staggers, his head covered in soil.

GUIDO
Jesus, what a hit!

And he runs to help Rodolfo, who is stunned. His hat has fallen off his head, landing upside
down on a nearby low wall, and his hair and jacket are covered in soil, leaves, and flowers.
Guido runs up to him.

GUIDO
T’m really sorry. Are you hurt? I didn’t do it purposely, I just
leaned, and...I’m really sorry...

He wants to help. But he has the six eggs in his hands. Quickly, he puts them inside Rodolfo’s hat
on the low wal! and starts brushing dirt off the town clerk’s jacket and hair.

DR. RODOLFO (furious)
I'll do that myself! And you can kiss your bookstore good-bye,
my good man!
15

But Guido keeps brushing soil off Rodolfo’s jacket while the latter, watching Guido with revenge
in his eyes, reaches for his hat.

GUIDO
No! The eggs!

But it’s too late: Sticky, yellowish raw egg spills from under the hat onto Rodolfo’s ears and face.
Instinctively, Guido steps back, while the town'clerk-watches him with a poisonous look.

DR. RODOLFO
You good-for-nothing! I"ll kill you!

He makes a grab for Guido, who runs like hell. Guido spots a man ahead on a bicycle, leading a
riderless bike with one hand. Without missing a beat, Guido makes a straddle jump onto the
empty bike seat and pedals off madly. The man realizes too late what has happened; he stops,
shocked, and gets off his bike, watching as the thief disappears beyond a curve, pedaling at full
speed.

MAN WITH THE BICYCLE (yelling)
Hey, that’s mine, what’re you doing?

Before he can yell, “Stop, thief!” another guy comes along and snatches his bike. It is Rodolfo,
who jumps onto the seat and pedals after Guido. The man goes running after the two thieves,
shouting at the top of his lungs.

SCENE 10

CITY STREETS—EXT., DAY

Guido turns a comer and stops short so as not to hit a line of children being shepherded across
the street by their teacher. The bike skids and turns over on its side. Guido misses the children
but winds up colliding with the teacher, who is none other than the pretty young Dora he met at -
the little farm. She is thrown in the air, and this time it’s Guido who lands on top.

GUIDO (smiling)
Good morning, Princess!

He stands up under her astonished gaze.

GUIDO
Maybe someday we'll meet standing up! Sorry—gotta run.

He runs off at full speed while Dora, somewhat amazed and somewhat amused, gets to her feet.
a

16

SCENE 11
THE GRAND HOTEL—INT., DAY

It is moming. In the huge, luxurious lobby of the Grand Hotel, the staff is busy cleaning: dusting,
polishing, arranging flowers, brushing the sofas, pushing breakfast carts toward the service
elevators. Guido walks quickly down the main staircase. As he walks, he is putting on his tight,
sleek tuxedo jacket. His shirt is buttoned wrong, his tie is undone. He walks toward his uncle,
who sees him and sits down at a table set with a tray holding a bottle of champagne and two
glasses. Buttoning his shirt, Guido stops in front of his uncle.

UNCLE
Chicken!

GUIDO
Easy! Chicken is served whole, on its back on the plate. “Would
you cut it for me?” “Of course!” First, I hold the chicken down
with the knife blade stuck under its wing and rip off the
drumstick. Then I slice the meat along the breastbone. Off go the
wings and breast, off goes the skin....

His uncle, satisfied, interrupts.

UNCLE
Lobster!

Panic flashes in the apprentice waiter’s eyes.

GUIDO
I stick the skin under the wing. ..off goes the leg, I rip off the
lobster... stick the...lobster is a crustacean. Off with the crust....

(He hesitates.)
...Off with the antennae, off goes the lobster. There’s nothing
left. We're out of lobster but we have some delicious chicken.

His uncle watches, puzzled.

GUIDO
I don’t remember lobster, Uncle.

UNCLE
Lobster is served just as it comes out of the kitchen. You don’t
touch it.

GUIDO
Too easy, that’s why I didn’t remember.
UNCLE
Go on!

Guido pretends he is a page at court: With his back arched, he minces around his uncle,
mimicking the movements of a good waiter.

GUIDO
Behavior. Stand by. Still, tike this. “Waiter!” “Yes?” In position,
stand-by behavior. “Waiter!” Why are they al] calling me? There
must be other waiters, right?

UNCLE
Champagne!

He hops around like a waiter called to serve several tables. He stops a moment to think. His uncle
watches, stunned. Guido starts going through various kinds of bows.

GUIDO
The bow is simple! Hands on hips...lower the torso...and...and

you swing down like a bottle of champagne. Forty-five
degrees...er, fifty...no...

He bows, literally, in half.
GUIDO
No! More than ninety degrees! At right angles! Let’s show
how...Okay, Uncle, what's the degree for a proper bow?
His uncle shakes his head and stands up.
UNCLE
Look at sunflowers bowing to the sun. If you see one bowed too
low, it means it’s dead. You are serving, but you’re no servant!

Uncle approaches his nephew, who is still bowed low.

UNCLE
Serving is the highest art. The Lord is the first servant...

Fondly, he starts tying his nephew’s tie.

UNCLE
God serves men but he's not a servant to men!

Uncle sticks his finger under Guido’s collar.

GUIDO
There’s no button here.
18

UNCLE
It doesn’t go there, silly!

Smiling, he gives his nephew a light smack on the head. Then he takes the bottle of champagne
and shakes it.

SCENE 12
UNCLE’S HOUSE—INT., NIGHT

The two friends are in bed, one next to the other, in pajamas. A lamp is lit, but on an old table
against the far wall. Ferruccio seems worried, his head resting on the pillow.

FERRUCCIO

Thave to bring the car back to my father, he’s counting on it.
GUIDO

In a month.
FERRUCCIO

No, J promised I’d bring it back sooner. You know why?
He stops.

GUIDO
Why?

Ferruccio doesn’t answer, and Guido, worried, pokes him.

GUIDO
Ferruccio?

Ferruccio awakes from a deep sleep, and looks around, frightened.

FERRUCCIO
What is it? What time is it?

GUIDO
What are you talking about? We were talking a moment
ago....Were you sleeping?

FERRUCCIO
Of course I was sleeping!

GUIDO
You asked me a question, turned your head, and went to sleep.
How did you do that?
19

FERRUCCIO
Schopenhauer!

GUIDO
Who?

FERRUCCIO

Schopenhauer says that with will, you can do anything: “I am
what | want,” and right now I want to be asleep. So I say to
myself, “Sleep, sleep, sleep!” And I’m asleep.

Excited, Guido pays attention.

GUIDO.
Nice. Simple.

He moves his fingers, conjuring something to come to him, and his voice gets deep and
mysterious.

GUIDO
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

FERRUCCIO (annoyed)
Stop moving your hands, you're not a juggler. This is real
serious stuff, it takes time! Okay, good night, we'll talk about it
tomorrow.

Guido is puzzled. But Ferruccio falls asleep instantly. So Guido practices the theory: He moves
his fingers above his sleeping friend's face.

GUIDO
‘Wake up, wake up...
(HE RAISES HIS VOICE.)
‘Wake up!

Ferruccio opens his eyes with a start, frightened.

FERRUCCIO
‘What is it? What are you doing?

GUIDO (excited)
Wow, it works.

FERRUCCIO
What works?
20

GUIDO
Schopenhauer! I said, “Wake up, wake up,” and you woke up
right away! The will is incredible. How does it all happen?
FERRUCCIO
It happens that you woke me up. You were yelling “Wake up”
into my ear, so of course, I woke up!

GUIDO
You mean IJ should say it lower.

FERRUCCIO
No, don’t say it at all! It’s deep—you have to think it.

Ferruccio turns his back and closes his eyes again. Guido tries to think his friend awake again.
SCENE 13
THE CITY, A PIAZZA AND A BAR—EXT., DAY

The city is sunny and festive. Ferruccio walks in long strides. Guido, behind him, can barely
keep up.

GUIDO
Take it easy, where are you going?

FERRUCCIO
T’m late!

They pass the same workman, in his overalls, with a basket of fruit in one hand. He is looking up
at the third floor.

WORKMAN
Maria! The key!

From the third floor window, someone throws the heavy key, which lands on Guido’s shoulder,
nearly knocking him over.

GUIDO
Ow!

WORKMAN
Sorry!

Guido runs toward Fernuccio, laughing.
—

21

GUIDO
Every day he has someone throw down the key. It nearly hit me
in the head!

SCENE 14
THE CITY STREETS—EXT., DAY
Two women are walking nearby: Dora and her friend ELENA, who is also a schoolteacher.
GUIDO
Look! That’s the teacher. Boy is she pretty. ] even dreamt about
her. Come on, I’ll introduce you.

As they approach the women, Guido stops and hides behind Ferruccio, who stops dead, still as a
statue.

GUIDO
Holy smokes! Stay still.

FERRUCCIO
What?

Rodolfo, the town clerk, has stopped his car, and gotten out. He is past the two men and is
approaching the women, who greet him enthusiastically.

GUIDO
Stop. That’s the jerk the eggs fell on, the town clerk. Stop! If he
sees me he'll kill:me. Now what's he doing? Did he leave?

Guido’s face is up against the back of Ferruccio’s neck. Ferruccio is standing absolutely still,
watching the two women and the clerk.

FERRUCCIO
No, he’s there, he’s talking.

GUIDO
What's he saying?

FERRUCCIO
How should I know?

GUIDO
What’s he doing?

FERRUCCIO
He’s saying good-bye. He’s leaving. He’s got a car just like
mine.
22

Rodolfo kisses both women on the cheek. On his way back to his car, he passes Ferruccio.

FERRUCCIO
Here he is!

GUIDO
Don’t move! He’l! kill me if he sees me.

The car, which is made by the same manufacturer and is the same color as Ferruccio’s (but shiny
and clean), moves off. Dora and Elena start walking toward Ferruccio, who, embarrassed, doesn’t
move. He still has not caught his breath. As the women come to the “statue,” they stop for a
moment, just in time for Guido to pop out from behind his friend.

GUIDO
Good morning, Princess.

He takes his hat off.
Dora is surprised and amused. Elena is frightened.
Dora laughs and looks at Guido as if he were a magician.

DORA
It’s you—again. How do you do it?

Guido introduces Dora to Ferruccio.

GUIDO
This is the princess who fell into my arms from the sky!

Elena figures out who Guido is.

ELENA
Oh—is he the one who sucked the stinger out of your thigh?

DORA
Yes, yes!

She says happily to Guido.
Do you always appear out of nowhere? We always meet like
this...

GUIDO
Next time we can plan it. How about tonight at eight?

DORA (smiling)
No, this way’s nicer.
23

ELENA
Come on, Dora, you'll be late for school.

DORA (to Guido)
T hope we mun into each other again—by chance. *Bye!

GUIDO
Farewell, Princess!

Walking quickly, the two women go on their way.

GUIDO (to Ferrucio)
Did you see her? She’s pretty. She tikes it when I suddenly
appear.

SCENE 15

THE GRAND HOTEL—INT., NIGHT

It is the middle of the night. In the hotel lobby only a few lights are lit. There is hardly anyone
around. Guido, wearing his tuxedo, comes out of the kitchen holding a tray and walks to the bar
where there is only one customer: DR. LESSING, a middle-aged German with an easy-going,
vaguely intellectual air. He is seated at a table sipping a glass of cognac.

Guido, tray in hand, stops before the German, looks at him, and smiles. Dr. Lessing understands
immediately.

DR. LESSING
I don't believe it!

GUIDO
“Obscurity.”

DR. LESSING

Guido, you’re a genius.

GUIDO
“The more there is, the less you see it!” Answer: “Obscurity!”
It’s great! Did you make the riddle up yourself, doctor?

DR. LESSING
No, but you solved it in five minutes, it took me eight days.
Obscurity.
Guido puts the tray down on the table.

GUIDO
Here we are!
24

The familiarity and affability between waiter and guest are evident. Guido indicates the plates on

the tray.
GUIDO
Salmon, salad, and a glass of white wine.
DR. LESSING (concentrating hard)
Listen to this one, Guido.
Guido stops him.
GUIDO

If I may, it’s my turn! I learned this one as a kid: “Snow White
and the seven dwarfs sit down for a bite. How fast can you guess
what she serves her guests next?”

He smiles smugly. Dr. Lessing picks up his pen and writes the riddle down, repeating it as he
writes.

DR. LESSING (translating into German as he writes)
It sounds refined. I want to solve it right away.

GUIDO
Eat first or it’lt get cold.

Dr. Lessing looks at the tray and wrinkles his nose.

DR. LESSING
Guido, I’m sorry, it looks very good, but I can’t, it’s too late.

GUIDO
What? Salmon, salad, white wine...it’s a light supper.

DR. LESSING (thinking out loud)
“Snow White and the seven dwarfs...”

The NIGHT PORTER, in uniform, walks up behind Guido and says in a low voice,

NIGHT PORTER
Guido!
Guido goes to him.
NIGHT PORTER
Is the kitchen closed?
GUIDO

( Everyone’s gone, why?
25

NIGHT PORTER
There’s a gentleman just arrived from Rome, from the ministry.
He wants to eat.

GUIDO
The kitchen’s closed.

NIGHT PORTER (whispering)
Too bad. He’s a good tipper.

GUIDO
The kitchen’s open. Show him in, where is he?

He is standing a few steps from the night porter: it is an INSPECTOR from the Ministry of
Public Education. He has a pile of files under his arm; his glasses rest on the tip of his nose. He
has a strict air about him, and carries a raincoat and hat in his hand. Guido goes to meet him and
shows him to a table in the bar.

GUIDO
Please, sit down!

He seats him at a table with his back toward Dr. Lessing. Then he goes quickly to the doctor’s
table.

GUIDO
You're sure you don’t want to eat anything?

Dr. Lessing sips his cognac, his head is in the clouds.

DR. LESSING
No, no! “Snow White and the seven dwarfs...”

Guido returns to the inspector’s side.

INSPECTOR
1 know the kitchen’s closed, but maybe you could find
something for a cold supper...

GUIDO
Leave it to me! Pick whatever you like, everything’s delicious!

INSPECTOR
Something light.

GUIDO
Well, we have...meat: a nice rich steak, or lamb, or kidney,
breaded, fried liver...tough...or fish.
26

INSPECTOR
Fish, fish!

GUIDO
Good. How about a nice, fatty turbot? Or eel stuffed with fatty
sausage and greased with Grand Mamier? Or some lean salmon.
Whatever you'd like.

INSPECTOR
The salmon. Thank you.

GUIDO (interrupts him)
Side dish?

INSPECTOR
There’s a side dish too?

GUIDO

Feel free to choose. We have very, very, very fried mushrooms,
Nancy buttered potatoes with a creamy sauce.

The inspector looks nauseated.

INSPECTOR
Don’t you have a simple, light salad? If not, forget it.

GUIDO
A light salad? Too bad; the very fried mushrooms are out of this
world. So: steamed salmon and salad, and a glass of white wine.

INSPECTOR
Perfect!

He looks at his watch.
As soon as possible.

GUIDO
Pll do my best.

Guido goes to Dr. Lessing, takes the tray that is on the table and puts it down in front of the
Inspector who, reading the papers, is amazed, so amazed that, thinking he has lost all sense of
time, he looks at his watch. Meanwhile, Dr. Lessing has stood up and is going toward the stairs.
He stops near Guido and looks him straight in the eye.

DR. LESSING
“How fast can you guess what she served her guests next...”
27

GUIDO
Right!

DR. LESSING
Good night.

He climbs the stairs, repeating the riddle to himself.

INSPECTOR (to Guido)
What did he say? Snow White? What, is he drunk?

GUIDO
No, it’s a riddle: “Seven seconds.” Seven seconds is the solution
time. Snow White and the seven dwarfs. If there are seven
dwarfs dining and she serves seconds, that means seven seconds.
Dr. Lessing is a physician, a very serious person. But he’s
obsessed with riddles, he loses sleep over them.

Guido notices a red, white, and green sash folded on top of the Inspector's files.

INSPECTOR
Excuse me, the Francesco Petrarca elementary school...

GUIDO

It’s not far from here. A friend of mine teaches there. Great
school.

INSPECTOR
Good, so I can sleep an extra half hour.

As he eats, he looks through his files.

GUIDO
You have to be there tomorrow moming?

INSPECTOR
Yes, they’re expecting me at eight-thirty.

He retums to the inspector.

GUIDO
So, tomorrow moming, you’re going to the school...

The inspector turns and looks at Guido.

INSPECTOR
Yes. I’m visiting the classes.
GUIDO
Visiting all the classes. Well. Good, good. You'll have some
good advice for the children. You'll check everything out.

The inspector finishes his meal and drinks the wine.

INSPECTOR
More or less. That's my job, I’m an inspector.

GUIDO
An inspector’s an important person. So you have to be at the
school at eight-thirty tomorrow.

INSPECTOR
Right. And now I’m going to bed. Thanks for the excellent meal.

He stands up and takes his things.

GUIDO
Tl show you the way.

He picks up the inspector’s raincoat, hat, and tricolor sash. The inspector takes his briefcase.
They move to the elevator. Guido gives the inspector his raincoat and hat.

GUIDO
Here you are.

INSPECTOR
Oh, I forgot—I'd like a wake-up call at seven, not a minute
earlier, not a minute later. Good night.

GUIDO
Good night.

The elevator door closes. Guido tums and goes quickly to the night porter. In his hands, which
are behind his back, he is carrying the inspector’s tricolor sash. At the night desk, Guido says to
the night porter,
GUIDO

‘Wake-up cali for him at nine! Not a minute earlier, not a minute

later.
He leaves.
SCENE 16

FRANCESCA PETRARCA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL-—-CLASSROOM
INT.-EXT., DAY
29

A large classroom. The children, all dressed up in clean, pressed uniforms, are sitting somewhat
intimidatedly, at desks arranged to form a large “M.” The school’s teachers and administrators
are standing behind tables that make up the dais; there is an elderly lady PRINCIPAL, the
SECRETARY, several TEACHERS (Dora among them).

PRINCIPAL
Please, children, silence! A moment of attention. The inspector
from Rome will be here shortly..1 want to make a good
impression on him. Listen very quietly and carefully to what he
says. He’ll tell us some very important things about our
beautiful country.

AMAN IN A SUIT mans past the students towards the principal.

MAN INA SUIT
The inspector is here, ma’am.

PRINCIPAL
He's already here? He’s early! Sit down, Roberto!

The inspector’s loud, sure footsteps are heard. The children are quiet. Guido, wearing the red,
white, and green sash draped over one shoulder and running between his legs, makes his
entrance.

PRINCIPAL
All rise!

The children jump to their feet in unison. Guido walks past the students as they stand, and strides
toward the teachers. Dora sees him and is astonished.

GUIDO (to Dora)
Good moming, Princess.

PRINCIPAL
Good morning, Mr. Inspector. I’m the principal. These are some
of our teachers.

GUIDO
Good.

Guido begins shaking hands with each teacher. The first one is DORA’S FRIEND.

GUIDO
So...how many years have you taught in this schoo! district?

DORA’S FRIEND
Sixteen.
os

30

GUIDO (to a male teacher)
GUIDO
And are you up to date with the ongoing school program
approved by the ministry this year?
MALE TEACHER #1
Yes.
GUIDO (to a female teacher)
Did you read the bulletin regarding childhood hygiene?
FEMALE TEACHER #1
Of course!
GUIDO (to Dora)
What are you doing on Sunday?
DORA
What?
GUIDO
No, I mean, Sunday...is St. Mary’s Day. What are you doing?
DORA
I’m going to the theater.
GUIDO
To see what?
DORA
Offenbach.
GUIDO
Right. They’re playing Offenbach. Fine. Well...
GUIDO (to Principal)
Thank you very much and good-bye. I just came to...
PRINCIPAL
We know.
PRINCIPAL (to the group)

As you know, the inspector came from Rome to talk to us about
the race manifesto signed by the most enlightened Italian
scientists.

She points to the poster on the wall, which Guido scans rapidly.
31

PRINCIPAL
He will, and we’re very honored, demonstrate to us that our race
is a superior, race—the best of all!

Take your seats.

The children sit down.

PRINCIPAL
Go ahead, Inspector.

GUIDO
Our race, as we know...

PRINCIPAL
.+-is superior!

GUIDO
_Naturally! Our race is superior. I’ve just come from Rome, right
this minute, to tell you in order that you’ ll know, children, that
our race is a superior one. I was chosen, I was, by racist Italian
scientists in order to demonstrate how superior our race is.

Ina flash, he jumps up on the table to show the children how handsome he is.

GUIDO
Why did they pick me, children? Must I tell you? Where can
you find someone more handsome than me? Justly so, there is
silence. I’m an original “superior race”—pure Aryan. Children,
let’s start with something that one says, “What's so big about
that?” The ear.

He shows his left ear to the children.

GUIDO
Look at the perfection of this ear. Left auricle with a pendant
litle bell at the end. Check it out! Movable cartilage! Bendable!
Find two ears more beautiful than these and I’l] leave! But you
have to show me them! They dream about these in France.
Races exist, children. You bet they do! But let’s continue. I want
to show you something else.

He begins to remove his jacket.

GUIDO
Pay attention.

SCENE 17
FRANCESCA PETRARCA SCHOOL—HALLWAY INT., DAY
The inspector and the man in a suit walk quickly down the hall.

INSPECTOR
He said “inspector”? From Rome?

SCENE 18
FRANCESCA PETRARCA SCHOOL—CLASSROOM INT., DAY

Guido in shorts and his undershirt, the tricolor sash looped over his shoulder and running
between his legs (accentuating everything), stands on the desks, which are arranged in an “M”
amongst the children. His undershirt is up around his belly, which he is showing to the children.

GUIDO
The belly button! Take a look at this belly button! What a knot!
But you can’t untie it, not even with your teeth! Those racist
scientists tried. Not a chance! This is an Italian belly button. It's
part of our race!

He parades up and down the “M,” showing his belly button to the children, then stops and shows
off his arm muscles.

GUIDO
Check out this style! Look at these muscles: ceps, biceps,
triceps! Look at this beauty! Admire this hip!

Guido dances on the desks.

GUIDO
Just look at the movement! Gentlemen!

The inspector, standing in the doorway, can’t believe his eyes. Guido spots him and quickly
gathers up his clothes from the windowsill.

GUIDO
I must say good-bye now, because I have to go, I have an
appointment. I’ll make my Aryan exit and bid you farewell.
Farewell!

Guido jumps onto a windowsill and lifts his shirt, revealing his belly button.

GUIDO
The belly button!
33

Clothes in hand, he’s about to jump out the window. But first he turns to Dora.

GUIDO
T’ll see you in Venice, Princess!

He jumps out the window.

SCENE 19

THE THEATER: AUDIENCE AND STAGE—INT., DAY
It is the fourth act of The Tales of Hoffmann.

Scene is Venice at night. On the water, silver in the moonlight, a gondola carries Juliette and
Nicklaus. They are singing the heartrending “Belle nuit d’amour.”

Dora, her face lit by the reflection from the stage, is sitting in one of the orchestra boxes. She is
rapt in the music. Her friends, seated behind her, are also spellbound by the performance. Elena
is there with a male friend; so is Rodolfo and another young man. The entire audience is
enthralled by the performance before their eyes. Only one person is not looking at the stage; he is
turned toward an orchestra box. It is Guido, entranced by the lovely Dora. At his left, consulting
the libretto in the dim light, is Ferruccio. At his right is an UNKNOWN WOMAN. She is not
beautiful but, seeing how uninterested Guido is in the performance, and that he is tumed in her
direction, she watches him with an intent, puzzled expression. Guido smiles quickly and points to
his left ear.

GUIDO (in a whisper)
Thear only with this ear.

The lady relaxes and sits back to enjoy the opera. The two singers are at the end of the piece.
Gently rocked by the low waves of the lagoon, they sing the finale of the Barcarole. Dora listens
closely, her eyes moist with emotion. Guido watches her and, waving the fingers on both hands
slightly, murmurs something.

GUIDO (murmuring)
Look at me, Princess—I’m here. Turn around...
(HE RAISES HIS VOICE SLIGHTLY.)
Tur around, turn around...
Dora moves slightly, as if prodded by an invisible force.
Guido concentrates harder, moves his fingers more quickly.

GUIDO

Ever so slowly, she turns. Guido is in seventh heaven, his face frozen in a smile of ecstasy. The
lady next to him has turned to him, and this time she smiles at him, perhaps with a pinch of
malice. Guido comes to his senses, a little frightened, and finally turns his attention to the stage
and the hypnotic beauty of the opera.

SCENE 20

THEATER—EXT., TWILIGHT

The full-house matinee performance is over. The spectators, leaving the theater, find that the sky
has darkened and it is pouring rain. The crowd is thickest at the theater doors; a few umbrellas
open. Some people risk the downpour, running for the covered portico or to get their cars.
SCENE 21

THEATER, CORRIDOR, BOXES, STAIRS—INT., NIGHT

Leaving their box, Dora and Rodolfo mix with the rest of the audience going toward the staircase
and exit. Their friends are up ahead.

DORA
T'mso glad I came. it’s put me ina good mood. Let's go for a
chocolate ice cream.
RODOLFO
Okay, but we'll have to be quick.
DORA
Why?
RODOLFO
We have to be at the prefect’s at eight. We were invited to
dinner.
DORA
Where?

Rodolfo is exaggeratedly patient, speaking in a low voice while he smiles left and right.

RODOLFO
At the prefect’s!

DORA (to herself, disappointed)
Oh, Lord! Say it isn’t so. Another dinner at the prefect’s?

RODOLFO
Your mother’s coming too.

DORA
Bingo. I am not going to the prefect’s!

 
_

35

RODOLFO
Okay, dinner, just the two of us. We can stop at the prefect’s
afterwards for coffee.

DORA
1am not coming.

«.. .RODOLFO
Fine, I get it. I'll tell him we're not going. It’s just you and me.

They begin descending the stairs, and meet the PREFECT and his wife: He is all dolled up, she is
covered in jewels.

PREFECT (cordially)
Good evening, Rodolfo.
(TO DORA)
Signorina.
All smile.

RODOLFO
Good evening, Prefect!

PREFECT
So I will expect you shortly. See you at eight.

RODOLFO (intimidated)
‘We'll be there at eight o’clock sharp.

The prefect and his wife go downstairs ahead of the couple. Dora doesn’t move. Rodolfo tums to
give her his hand, and she sneaks him a kick in the shin.

RODOLFO
Ow!

SCENE 22

THE THEATER’S MAIN ENTRANCE—INT., NIGHT

It is thundering. The entrance is crowded with theatergoers seeking shelter from the rain and
waiting until it lets up a little. Some dart out into the downpour. Guido is with Ferruccio, near the

coatroom. He stands on tiptoe, looking for Dora.

GUIDO
Where is she? Have you seen her?

‘The upholsterer, all dressed up, approaches them. He is with his wife.
36

UPHOLSTERER (to Ferruccio)
You? Here?

GUIDO
How are you?

UPHOLSTERER

- Right.on time tomorrow, okay?
Ferruccio nods and smiles at the upholsterer’s wife.
UPHOLSTERER
Did you unload that stuff from the car? That’s silk, I don’t want
it ruined.
The coatroom attendant puts the upholsterer’s raincoat and hat on the counter.

UPHOLSTERER
Nice production, wasn’t it?

Guido sees the upholsterer’s hat and immediately decides to play his usual game: He reaches for
the curtains on the wall.

GUIDO
A great production! Did you do these curtains?

The upholsterer tums to look, and Guido exchanges the hats: He puts on the upholsterer’s and
leaves his own on the raincoat.

UPHOLSTERER
Which? No, I didn’t do these.

Guido pulls Ferruccio into the crowd. The upholsterer turns, but can’t find them. He notices the
hat switch.

UPHOLSTERER
He took my hat!

SCENE 23
THE THEATER ENTRANCE—EXT., NIGHT
It is still pouring. Dora and Rodolfo are standing on the doorstep. She steps back.

RODOLFO
Come on, let’s go.
37

DORA
It’s raining too hard. You go get the car.

RODOLFO
Okay, okay. Wait here, I'll stop in front and honk the horn.

Guido has heard the conversation. He has a sly look in his eye. As Rodolfo runs out into the rain,
Guido turns to. Ferruccio and says excitedly,

GUIDO
Give me the keys! Give me the keys!

Ferruccio gives him the house key.

GUIDO
Not the house key, the car key! Hurry!

Ferruccio takes the car key out of his pocket, but he is worried.

FERRUCCIO
The car key? Are you nuts?

Guido grabs the key and starts to move. But he tums back suddenly.
GUIDO
Keep him busy—the jerk the eggs fell on! Keep him busy as
long as you can! See you tonight.

Guido hurries out into the street by another exit door.

FERRUCCIO
But the car—there’s—go slow!

He runs into the street and gets soaking wet. Dora is waiting at the theater exit, trying not to get
wet. She sees a black car waiting at the sidewalk, tooting its horn. She hesitates a second, then
Tushes out toward the car. She gets in, and closes the door angrily. The car moves off.

SCENE 24
THE CITY; THE CAR—INT-EXT., NIGHT

Dora, furious, refuses to look the driver in the face. She tries to brush the rain off her clothes as
best she can.

DORA
‘You could at least have come and gotten me with an umbrella! You’re just
plain rude. Look what a mess I am!
38

She takes a hand mirror from her purse and tries to make repairs.

DORA
If there’s anything that makes me really upset, it’s dinner at the
Pprefect’s.
She begins to hiccough.

1 knew it. Lhave the hiccoughs. I always get hiccoughs when I
have to do something I don’t want to do.

Guido is completely focused on driving. Rain is falling like a waterfall on the windshield and the
windshield wipers aren’t working.

DORA
Don’t you know that it takes very little to make me happy: a
chocolate ice cream, maybe two; a nice walk together and then
whatever happens, happens.

She tums toward the man she thinks is Rodolfo.

DORA
Instead you—
She screams.
Aaaah!
She puts her hand over her heart.
GUIDO

Good moming, Princess.

She looks around and realizes she is in the wrong car. Pillows, pillowcases, and rolls of fabric are
piled on the backseat. She pulls her skirt down to cover her legs. She puts the hand mirror back in
her purse.

DORA
This is too much. You'd better explain.

GUIDO
No, you explain! First, I stop under a hayloft and you fail into
my arms from the sky. I fall off a bicycle—and find myself in
your arms. I go to inspect a school—and there you are again. I
stop my car in front of the theater—and all of a sudden you
climb in. AND you show up in my dreams. Can’t you leave me
alone? This is some crush you have on me! ] don’t blame you,
but... Okay, I give up. Fine, you win. Where to, Princess? To the
beach? Do you like the beach? ~
39

Dora is amused, and even more amazed. Her hiccoughs have stopped.

DORA
Yes, yes, I like the beach. But people are waiting for me at the
theater. Take me back.

She laughs. But now it is raining even harder and Guido almost has to rest his nose on the
windshield to see. ‘The windshield wipers aren’t working.

GUIDO
Princess, do you know how to turn on the wipers?

She gets scared and grabs the dashboard, staring straight ahead at the water running down the
windshield.

DORA
Step on the brakes.

GUIDO
Have no fear, hang on to me!

A second later both start bouncing up and down. The car stops with a loud noise and the engine
goes dead. In the sudden silence they can hear the heavy rain and thunder. The steering wheel
falls off in Guido’s hand.

GUIDO (embarrassed)
Uh-oh. It’s broken.

DORA (a moment later)
Forgive me for asking, but when did you learn to drive?

GUIDO
Me? Uh, about ten minutes ago.

DORA
Oh. I'd have said less.

SCENE 25

THE CITY; STEPS; THE CAR-EXT.-INT., NIGHT

The car is stuck between two small stone pillars at the top of a long set of marble steps, in front
of a church. At the foot of the steps is an empty square. Rain is beating down. The car doors can’t

be opened because they are stuck against the pillars. It is pouring on Guido and Dora’s heads
because the crash has unhinged the car’s convertible top.
GUIDO
Don’t worry, Princess, we’ll get out of this. The important thing
is not to get wet.

He grabs a large pillow from the backseat, takes off the pillowcase, which is embroidered with
heraldic symbols in gold thread, and puts it over the steering wheel and shaft, creating a
makeshift umbrella. The convertible top pops completely open; he holds the pillow over Dora. It
is pouring cats and dogs on Guido.

GUIDO
Yikes, it’s freezing!

He gives her the makeshift umbrella, jumps out of the car, and runs around to Dora’s side. She

climbs onto the backseat, holding the “umbrella”; he is going to help her get out of the car, and
she is about to set foot on the ground, but Guido stops her, because the car is standing in a deep
puddle.

GUIDO
Stop, Princess! It’s a lake here, you'll get your feet wet!

In a flash he takes the heavy roll of colored silk from the back seat and starts unraveling it on the
ground. It unravels all the way down the marble steps, onto the square below, and up to the
Portico, like a royal red carpet. Now a real princess can step out of the car. Guido takes the
“umbrella” and holds it over her head as Dora jumps down onto the silk carpet. But her skirt gets
caught in the convertible top’s broken hinge and rips to her waist, so her gorgeous legs and
pantied behind are showing. But in the commotion and loud rain, neither Guido nor Dora realize
what’s happened.

Guido accompanies Dora along the red carpet, holding the “umbrella” by the steering wheel -
shaft. When they finally get to the portico, he is as soaked as a drowned Tat, but her clothes are
hardly wet.

DORA
Where are we? What piazza is this?

GUIDO
‘What? Don’t you recognize it? We’ ve been here together before.

DORA
You and 1? When?

GUIDO
‘What do you mean, when? When the car got stuck and it was
pouring and I made you an umbrella with the pillowcase.
Remember?

He puts the funny “umbrella” on his shoulder and dances a little waltz around her.
4]

( GUIDO
It was a beautiful night. I put the steering wheel on my shoulder
and danced a little waltz around you three times, and when I
stopped in front of you, you kissed me!

He waltzes around three times, humming the Barcarole. And stops in front of her. They stand stock-
still a moment, but in his comical go-round Guido has noticed that Dora’s skirt is ripped to the waist
in back. He takes another look behind her and goes dead serious.

GUIDO
Princess, your behind is blowing in the wind!

She has no idea what he’s talking about, then she puts her hands behind her and backs up until
she is leaning back against the wall. She looks around, distressed.

SCENE 26
THE CITY; UNDER THE PORTICOES—EXT., NIGHT

It has nearly stopped Taining. Dora and Guido are strolling under the porticoes. He has the
Steering wheel resting on his shoulder and she is holding the pillow behind her, covering her
behind.

DORA
It depends on the person. My father was like that. Oh, he could
get me to do anything. He understood me, he knew how to
handle me. And I was putty in his hands. I always said yes to
him!

Guido stops and stands in front of her, right under the window where the workman always calls
for Maria to throw him the key.

GUIDO
So all these treasures hidden inside you—is there a way to open
the treasure chest and get you to say yes?

DORA (smiling)
It’s easier than you think—all you need is the right key!

GUIDO
And where is this key?

DORA
Heaven knows!

She looks up at the sky, which is filled with drifting clouds.
42

DORA
It’s clearing up.

Guido glances quickly at the main door in the building where the workman always stops.

GUIDO :

So, this key that makes you say yes has to come from heaven.
DORA

I'm afraid so.
GUIDO-

T'll give it a try. Maybe the Madonna will throw it down to me.
He joins his hands as if in prayer, and raises them over his head.

GUIDO (shouting)
Maria! The key!

A second later a key comes flying out the window and Guido catches it in midair.

GUIDO
Is this it?

Dora is amazed—breathless. She looks up, then looks at the key in Guido’s hand. Almost
Tunning to take advantage of the brief truce in the weather, they cut across the piazza and start
down a boulevard.
SCENE 27
THE CITY; THE PORTICOES—EXT., NIGHT

GUIDO

Do you really have to go home? What about the ice cream? The
chocolate ice cream? We can get it right away.

DORA.
No, not now,

GUIDO
Then when?

DORA.
I don’t know.

Guido looks up at the sky.
43

GUIDO
Should we let heaven decide?

DORA (cautiously)
No, leave the Madonna alone, I beg you! Don’t bother her over a
chocolate ice cream.

Guido sees Dr. Lessing, come out of a cafe across the street. He is with a friend, and seems
happy. The doctor sees him and leaves his friend for a moment to stride over to Guido.

GUIDO (to Dora)
Since we can’t decide on our own when to get this chocolate ice
cream, I’1] have to ask.

He joins his hands and raises them over his head.

GUIDO
Maria! Send someone to tell us how long we need to wait to get
our ice cream!

Dr. Lessing stops in front of them.

DR. LESSING
Seven seconds!

He bows to Dora and moves off. Dora is about to faint. She smiles silently, the pillow slips from
her hands and falls on the ground. She does not move.

SCENE 28
THE CITY; DORA'S HOUSE—EXT., NIGHT

Dora and Guido arrive at her door. The building is called the Liberty, and is surrounded by neatly
clipped box hedges and wet cobblestones. In one hand, Dora holds the pillow against her behind.
In the other, she holds a chocolate ice-cream cone which she is devouring.

DORA
This is my house.

GUIDO
T’ve passed it a thousand times and I always wonder who lives
here. I wanted to open my shop here.

DORA
The bookshop?

GUIDO
‘Yes. Then we could see each other every day.
Dora finishes the ice-cream cone and smiles at Guido complicitously.

DORA
‘Well, *bye now.

She wipes her lips with her hand, like a child.

‘DORA
Forgive me, you’ ve been so kind. But now I need a nice, hot
bath.

GUIDO
Oh, wh, I forgot to tell you...

He hesitates.

DORA
‘What?

GUIDO
...that I want to make love to you so badly—you would not
believe how badly. Not just once, but over and over. But I’d
never admit it to anyone, most of all never to you. They would
have to torture me to make me admit it.

Dora doesn’t understand.

DORA
Admit what?

GUIDO
That I want to make love to you, over and over. But I'd never
admit it, only if I were crazy would I admit that I'd even make
love to you here, now, in front of your own house, for the rest of
my life.

He puts the steering wheel down, shaft first, like a cane, and leans on it. She stands still. Thunder
shakes the sky.

DORA
Run, you'll get wet, it’s going to rain again.

Guido takes off his hat to say good-bye, and water drains from it.

GUIDO (saying good-bye)
Princess...

Just then two bicycles come into view, and the upholsterer and his wife cycle by.
45

Dora realizes that Guido’s clothes are soaked.

DORA
Your suit is completely drenched. Be careful not to catch cold!

Guido sees the upholsterer look over his shoulder and stop the bike with a triumphant smile on
his face.

GUIDO
No, the suit’s fine. It’s the hat that’s bothering me. I need a dry
hat. But where can I find...?

He looks heavenward.

DORA (smiles)
It’s easy! How does it go?

She joins her hands and raises her eyes.

DORA (loudly)
Maria, send someone with a dry hat for my friend!

She has hardly finished her prayer when the upholsterer, without saying a word, stops alongside
Guido, takes the hat off Guido’s head and replaces it with Guido’s old one. Then, very proud of
himself, he goes back to his bicycle, which his wife is holding with one hand. As husband and wife
go along their way, the pillow falls from Dora’s hands again. Guido picks it up and puts it back
on the steering wheel to make an umbrella. It is raining again.

GUIDO
Good-bye, Princess.

Speechless, Dora retreats to hide the back of her naked legs. She is watching Guido as he walks
away under the umbrella, dancing and humming the Barcarole.

SCENE 29
THE GRAND HOTEL—INT., NIGHT

The party hasn't started yet. Guests are arriving in dribs and drabs in stunning evening dress. All
the hotel’s lights are ablaze, flowers and cocktail glasses shimmer along with the ladies’ jewels.
This is a modem hotel, built on a circular plan; the walls are frescoed with portraits of men and
women of great class who seem to be conversing while they sip champagne, smiling serenely.
Guido, in his waiter’s tux, is very happy as he crosses the room holding an enormous ostrich egg
in his hands. But then he spots someone and becomes alarmed. He hides his face behind the egg
and continues on his way. Rodolfo, who is with a friend, stops in front of him.

RODOLFO .
‘Waiter, excuse me, where is the men’s room?
GUIDO (hidden)
Straight ahead and left.

Rodolfo and friend walk on. Guido lowers the egg and continues on his way. He looks behind
him: the danger is past.

SCENE 30
DORA'S HOUSE—INT., NIGHT

The tidy bedroom glows calmly in the warm light of a night table lamp. Dora is in bed, the
covers drawn up to her neck, but she is made up and her hair is done. Her mother, LAURA, a
strict, if somewhat eccentric lady, is wearing a very elegant, mid-night blue evening gown.

LAURA
If you don’t get up immediately, I swear on your father’s
memory that I will never speak to you again for the rest of my
life!

Dora’s mother motions the maid to leave and goes to her daughter.
LAURA
I’m going to count to three now, and if you don’t get up, I'll
drag you up myself. One, two...and three!

She rips the covers off Dora, who is fully dressed down to her shoes and to the handbag on her
arm. Dora hiccoughs.

DORA (sadly)
Let’s go, then.

She gets up.

SCENE 31

THE GRAND HOTEL—INT., NIGHT

Guido is thrilled by the beautiful people and especially the beautiful girls in evening dress, The
orchestra plays lively music in the background. Guido is pushing a cart while turning to admire a
young lady’s decolletage. Then he does a swift about-face and instead of pushing the cart, pulls
it. In fact, Rodolfo has appeared behind Guido, a glass in hand. A couple, friends of his, are with
him. Farther ahead, as he nears the entrance, Guido hears Ferruccio cal] his name.

GUIDO
Do you know who’s getting married? That jerk the eggs fell on!

FERRUCCIO ~
And the bride?
47

GUIDO
No idea. Everyone’s waiting, but she’s not here yet.

ERNESTO, the other waiter, joins them. He is out of breath.

ERNESTO
Guido...

Guido approaches him.

ERNESTO
Your uncle...something’s happened. Come with me!

He goes toward the kitchen. Guido, worried, rushes after him.

GUIDO
‘Where is he?

ERNESTO
Outside, outside. The horse....

SCENE 32
BEHIND THE HOTEL—EXT., NIGHT

Ernesto walks outside into the hotel backyard ahead of Guido. Robin Hood, Uncle’s horse, is
standing free of the buggy. Uncle holds him by the reins. The horse is painted green, with red
paint on his lips, his eyes made up—and his mane is braided with colorful ribbons. On his flanks
and thighs a thunderbolt and a skull are painted in black, along with the words ACHTUNG CAVALLO
EBREO (“Attention, Jewish horse”).

GUIDO
Uncle!

He sees the horse and tries to minimize the incident as he helps his uncle tie the horse up.

GUIDO
Robin Hood, what did they do to you! Look at this—they made
you up! Not bad—what did they write? (he reads) “Attention,
Jewish horse.”

UNCLE
Barbarians! Vandals! It’s so sad. What nonsense. “Jewish
horse.” Did you ever?

Guido laughs to relieve the tension.
48

GUIDO
Forget it, Uncle. They did it to—

He means to say “play a joke,” but his uncle interrupts him.

UNCLE
No, no, they didn’t do it to...
(HE SMILES)
they did it to...
(HE TURNS SERIOUS)
You’ ll have to get used to it, Guido. They'll start on you, too.

GUIDO
On me! What can they do to me? The worst they can do is strip
me, paint me yellow, and write, “Attention, Jewish waiter!”
Come, let’s go, Uncle.

They go back into the hotel.

GUIDO
I didn’t know this horse was Jewish. I'll clean him up for you
tomorrow morning, okay?

SCENE 33
THE GRAND HOTEL—INT., NIGHT

Dora and her mother appear at the entrance to the Hotel. Dora is intimidated. The old porter, in
uniform, accompanies her into the lobby.

Laura sees an elderly gentleman who seems to be waiting for her, and she rushes ahead with a
smile. Guido comes down the staircase, very happy. At his feet, the party is in full swing. Voices are
lively, glasses clink, there is a crush of flashy clothes, jewelry, black ties and bare shoulders.
Ferruccio runs up the stairs to Guido, and stops in front of him, all excited.

FERRUCCIO
Look! Look straight ahead!

GUIDO
‘Where?

FERRUCCIO
There!

Dora, looking lovely, is standing with her friend Elena. In front of them is one of Rodolfo’s
friends, dressed to the nines.
49

GUIDO
Dora! Wait. I’ll surprise her.

He runs down the stairs.

He is about to go to her, all smiles, but Rodolfo is also approaching her. At the last minute, Guido
sees Rodolfo, grabs a vase of flowers from one of the tables, and hides his face behind it. He
backs up like a whipped cur, hidden behind the flowers..Rodolfo takes Dora by the arm and
walks away with her.

RODOLFO
Come, Dora, I'd like you to meet Fido Giovanardi.

Guido comes out from behind the flowers, lowers the vase, and sees Dora walk off and disappear
into the crowd of guests. Someone calls him.

DR. LESSING
Guido!

Guido tums and sees the German Dr. Lessing, with an immense book under his arm. A porter is
taking his suitcases out of the hotel. Still holding the flowers, Guido goes to meet him.

GUIDO
Doctor Lessing! Where are you going?

DR. LESSING
Urgent telegram, I have to leave for Berlin immediately. What
are these flowers?

GUIDO
For you—for your departure!

He gives the Dr. Lessing the vase of flowers.

DR. LESSING (laughs)
Tl take one.

He takes a flower from the vase.

DR. LESSING
I'll bring it to my wife—a Guido flower. I really enjoyed myself
with you, Guido. You're the cleverest waiter I’ve ever known.
By the way: If you say my name, I disappear. Who am I?

GUIDO
Thank you, doctor. And you are the most cultured guest I have
ever served.
DR. LESSING
Guido... if you say my name, I disappear.

He leaves the hotel. Guido stands still a moment, thinking, with the vase of flowers in his hand.
The old, dignified porter, in livery, has overheard the conversation.

PORTER
What? What did he say?
Guido’s eyes light up.
GUIDO
“Silence!” If you say it—if you say its name—it disappears!
Silence!
PORTER
I was never any good at riddles.
GUIDO
“They bloom in springtime.” What are they?
PORTER
Flowers!
GUIDO

Right! You win! Here!
He puts the vase of flowers in the porter’s hands, and moves away.

GUIDO
Ihave to go to the kitchen. “Silence.” Very nice.

The long table at which the engaged couple is seated is at the head of a series of medium-size
tables. Sitting with Dora and Rodolfo are his parents and her mother, and the couple’s closest

colleagues and friends— including the principal of the elementary schoo! and her husband and
several teachers. Rodolfo is seated between Dora and Elena, Dora’s friend, who could also be
mistaken for Rodolfo’s fiancée. Dora is seated at the head table with her mother, Rodolfo, the
principal, and a number of other guests.

PRINCIPAL
And not only in Berlin—even in the outskirts. In Grafeneck, in
the third grade. Listen to this, I remember it because I was so
struck by it. A lunatic costs the State four marks a day. A cripple
four and a half, an epileptic three and a half. The average rate is
four marks a day and there are three-hundred-thousand patients.
So how much would the state save if these individuals were
eliminated?
51

The listeners are startled by the problem. Dora is horrified.

DORA
I can’t believe this.

PRINCIPAL
That was exactly my reaction, Dora! “Good Lord, it can’t be!”
That.a child of seven can solve a problem like this? It’s a
difficult equation: the proportions, the percentages. Throw in a
little algebra. For us it’s high school material.

Rodolfo thinks a moment, then says,

RODOLFO
No, all you have to do is multiply! You said there are three
hundred thousand cripples?

PRINCIPAL
Yes.

RODOLFO
Three hundred thousand times four. Kill them al] and you save
one million, two hundred thousand marks a day. It’s easy.

THE PRINCIPAL
Exactly. Very good. But you’re an adult, Rodolfo. In Germany
children of seven solve the problem. It’s truly another race.

Just then Emesto, the waiter, puts a chocolate cake in front of Dora, but she is looking in the
other direction and doesn’t notice. Rodolfo approaches and sees the cake.

RODOLFO
Good morning, Princess!

Dora nearly jumps out of her chair. She stares at her fiancé, incredulous.

DORA
What did you say?

RODOLFO
Good moming, Princess. It’s there on the cake. See?

In fact, “Good moming, Princess” is written in icing on the cake. Dora looks around, stands up,
and a smile lights her eyes. She is about to leave the table when the orchestra starts playing a
peppy foxtrot. All the guests, without exception, get up to dance. Only Dora doesn’t move.
Rodolfo puts an arm around her waist and guides her to the dance floor. Everyone’s having the
time of their lives. It’s a great party. Red, white, and green confetti float down in the air, covering
everyone and everything. Seated at a nearby table is Ferruccio. A little dog with ribbons tied in
52

bows in its coat jumps up on his lap. A very skinny young woman takes the dog back and asks
Ferruccio to dance. Laura is dancing with the prefect, and the two bump into another couple: the
Fascist and the principal. The soft, feather-light confetti falls everywhere. Uncle and the old
porter in uniform are standing shoulder to shoulder next to each other. Uncle is looking at the
frescoes on the walls, where elegant guests are captured forever in paintings; the porter, smiling,
is watching the real flesh-and-blood guests at the live party. Guido, a happy man, comes out of
the kitchen with a tray in hand. He is looking for his beloved. The music stops and everyone
applauds. Guido turns distractedly.and sees, in the center of the deserted dance floor, Dora,
standing next to Rodolfo, the egg jerk.

RODOLFO (his voice raised)
Thank you, thank you. Just a few words—although you know it
all by now, anyway; you’ve known it for some years. Dora and I
were born on the same street, we went to the same school, and
we had the same friends. We have always been together. The
only thing we didn’t do together was military service!

Everyone laughs. Above the guests’ heads the tray that Guido is holding up in his hand floats like
a periscope. Rodotfo speaks more quickly.

RODOLFO
In brief, Dora is the woman of my life, and I am the man of her
life. We're going to be married within the year, and you are all
Officially invited: April nine, save the day. In the Church of Saint
Mary the Pilgrim. And then we'll party till dawn, all together here
again, as happy as we are now!
APPLAUSE.

BRUNO
Kiss her, kiss her!
RODOLFO’S FRIENDS SHOUT.

FRIENDS (in unison)
Kiss her, kiss her!

Tears shine in Laura’s eyes. Ferruccio frowns. Guido moves off, holding the tray high over his
head while in the center of the dance floor Rodolfo kisses Dora, who offers him her cheek. But
the innocent kiss is followed by a huge crash. Everyone turns; it’s only a clumsy waiter who has
tripped and fallen. Guido is on the floor, spread out like a dead frog amongst the pastries, cakes,
and silverware that have toppled in the crash. Ferruccio and Emesto run to help him. They pick
him up as the orchestra strikes up a waltz.

ERNESTO
What's wrong with you?

GUIDO
Nothing.
53

ERNESTO
( Are you all right?
GUIDO
Fine, fine

Uncle arrives, but Guido is already standing and cleaning up the mess on the floor.

GUIDO
Who put this armchair here?

FERRUCCIO
Are you all right?

GUIDO
I'm fine.

FERRUCCIO
I'm sorry.

GUIDO
I didn’t get hurt.

FERRUCCIO
No, I was talking about...

GUIDO
Are you enjoying yourself?

FERRUCCIO
It’s going fine.

GUIDO
Go back to your table. Go on, I can de this.

He stands up and starts picking up the mess as his uncle again approaches him.
Guido stands, with a poodle on his tray.

UNCLE
Are you all right?

GuIDO
Fine! Why are you all asking me that? Is there something
wrong?

UNCLE
No, nothing is wrong. But go to the kitchen.
54

GUIDO
Okay.

But he goes to the dance floor. As Emesto finishes cleaning up, Uncle calls to Guido.

UNCLE
Guido, go to the kitchen.

GUIDO

They moved everything tonight. Look where they put the

kitchen!
Guido goes to the kitchen like a robot. Uncle’s eyes follow him. Guido still doesn’t realize that
the dog is on the tray. The orchestra finishes a Charleston. The room is dotted with the bright
colors of the confetti. The dancers return to their tables and chairs. Dora, her mother, and
Rodolfo sit down at their places of honor at the long table. A young man in a Fascist uniform,
BRUNO, flushed and happily tipsy, moves toward the couple. He stops behind Rodolfo, who is
seated next to Dora, and covers his friend’s eyes with his hands, laughing.

BRUNO
Peekaboo, guess who? It’s me! What, have you gone soft?

Rodolfo is surprised. He tries to take the hands off his eyes.
Bruno laughs, takes Dora’s hand, and kisses it.
BRUNO
‘Young lady, we finally meet! Dora! We’ve never been
introduced—you were scared to, weren’t you?
He whispers something in Rodolfo’s ear.

BRUNO
I guess you won’t be coming with us to the bordello anymore.

He takes a step backward and raises his arms.

BRUNO (loudly)
Sorry to have bothered you—lots of luck and happiness!

He slaps Rodolfo on the shoulder.

BRUNO
‘You sly dog.

LAURA
‘What a happy fellow! ~
55

Guido comes out of the kitchen with a tray of confections. He passes Dora’s table & drops the
tray.

GUIDO
Don’t worry about a thing, I'll pick them up. I apologize.

He looks around to be sure his uncle hasn’t seen his latest catastrophe, then bends down to pick
up the mess. This time ‘Dora has seen everything, and sees him disappear under the table. Next to
her is Rodolfo, who is talking with a friend. On her other side is her mother, who is talking to the
principal.

LAURA (to Dora)
What was the name of the girl who married Remo, that rich guy
with a limp? Marianna!

She turns to the principal.

LAURA
.--She used to go out alone every night; smoked like a chimney.
She took all his money.

PRINCIPAL
No!

LAURA
Yes, I tell you! I knew it the moment I set eyes on her...

Meanwhile, Dora is slipping slowly under the table. No one notices. Guido is on his knees
gathering up the confections. He raises his eyes and sees an apparition: Dora, on her hands and
knees, crawling toward him.

GUIDO
Princess, you’re here too?

DORA (with a half smile)
Eh!

Without a moment’s hesitation, she kisses him on the lips, a long, funny kiss. Their lips part and
she turns serious.

DORA
Take me away!

She turns and crawls backward slowly. He watches her go, spellbound.

GUIDO (to himself)
Take me away...
56

Dora is crawling away, her behind facing Guido. She turns her head, smiles again. There is a
drum rolt and a trumpet sounds; the musicians start improvising some vaguely African melody.
Four Ethiopians, in colorful native costume, come down the stairs carrying a large tray on their
shoulders. On the tray is the immense Ethiopian cake. The orchestra leader is speaking at the
microphone.

ORCHESTRA LEADER
And now, a superb show, courtesy of the hotel management:
Ethiopian cake!
APPLAUSE.

The Africans go toward the dais, but the orchestra, resuming play, catches sight of something
taking place in the other direction and their music slowly dies away. A man who has been
shaking a bottle of champagne stops.Coming through the main entrance is a man wearing a
tuxedo; he is seated on a green horse. It is an unreal image. On the mare the words, ATTENTION,
JEWISH HORSE are painted. Guido is in the saddle, smiling broadly.Everyone, caught unaware by
the sight, is breathless. The horseman makes the rounds of the room. He passes in front of the
musicians, takes the bottle of champagne from the hands of the gentleman who was uncorking it,
and gestures to the orchestra.

GUIDO
Music, Maestro!

The orchestra leader, amused because he thinks this is part of the hotel’s entertainment (as do
most of the guests), waves his baton. The music starts, even louder than before. Ferruccio jumps
to his feet. He has the little dog in his hand; it is barking. The dog runs away; Ferruccio grabs it
again. Uncle, who is pouring cognac into a glass, stops and drinks cognac from the bottle. Guido
and the horse finish their tour of the room and stop before the guests of honor. The music stops.
Guido extends his hand to Dora.

GUIDO
Congratulations.

RODOLOFO
Thank you.

GUIDO

Come, Princess!

Dora is excited and frightened. She hesitates, but only for a moment. Rodolfo stares at the
horseman, deeply suspicious.

RODOLFO
Aren’t you. ..?

GUIDO (to Dora)
Quick, Princess!
57

She steps onto the chair and then onto the table, then settles herself on the horse in her knight’s
arms. Guide offers the bottle of champagne to Rodolfo. Rodolfo takes the bottle and holds it
distractedly, wondering where he has seen this man. Everyone around him is still convinced that
this is part of the hotel’s entertainment. Uncle is standing in the background, next to the Africans
who are holding the Ethiopian cake on their shoulders. He is just a step from Rodolfo. Noting
Dora’s mother’s and fiancée’s confusion, he suddenly starts applauding. The orchestra starts
playing again, a wildly happy tune. And the horse goes toward the exit. As Rodolfo grows ever
more alarmed, the cork on the champagne boutle.in his hand is slowly rising.

RODOLFO (realizing)
That's...

He starts to stand; the champagne cork pops violently, shoots like a bullet to the ceiling, and
lands like a bomb on the fake ostrich’s neck. The enormous egg falls down...and breaks on poor
Rodolfo’s head.

RODOLFO (pointing at Guido)
That's the jerk with the eggs!

His face and clothes have egg all over them. As he tries to clean himself up, Rodolfo jumps
furiously from table to table, going after the two fugitives. The guests move aside for him, but
just as the horse is crossing the threshold on its way out, Ferruccio steps in front of Rodolfo and
blocks his way. Rodolfc shoves him out of the way and runs toward the door, shouting.

RODOLFO
Doraaaa...!

He runs out. Everyone follows. The orchestra keeps playing. The four Ethiopians in costume are
still standing absolutely still, the tray with the cake balanced on their shoulders. The ostrich is on
its side on the cake like a dead bird with its beak wide open. Standing next to them, Uncle is
smiling.

SCENE 34

UNCLE’S HOUSE AND GREENHOUSE—EXT., DAWN-DAYLIGHT

Guido is off the horse and is helping Dora dismount. They too are covered in green, like Robin
Hood. The first, sweet hues of daylight lend an unreal tone to the scene. Guido goes to the door
of the house and looks in his pocket for the key. He becomes increasingly anxious.

GUIDO
No! Ferruccio! Ferruccio has the house key, damn it.

Instinctively he shakes the door in the vain hope that it will open. Dora watches, amused and
curious about the premises. She goes toward the greenhouse.
58

GUIDO
Wait. I need a wire. My father taught me. I’m a wiz with wire. I
used to make toys out of wire when I was a kid. Here we go!

He bends down to pick up a bunch of wires while Dora, curious, stops on the threshold of the
greenhouse. Guido sticks a wire into the lock and starts working it. Finally it opens. With a smile,
he tums toward Dora, and sees her entering the greenhouse. Guido decides to follow her; his
heart is beating a mile a minute. He too enters the greenhouse. The door remains open; from
beyond it there is only a mysterious, otherworldly silence for some moments until finally Guido’s
voice, loud and very happy, is heard from inside the house.

A Few Years Later

GUIDO’S VOICE (calling loudly)
Joshua? Joshua, let’s go, you’re going to make Mommy late.
Finally JOSHUA comes out of the greenhouse door, preceded by comical sounds of things
crashing to the ground. Joshua is about six years old: He is skinny and lively, wearing short
pants, a clean shirt, and suspenders. He is holding a piece of string from which hangs a small, tin,
armored tank. He comes out the door in a rush, trips, falls, and picks himself right up again.

JOSHUA
T couldn’t find my tank!

GUIDO
Don’t worry we’ll find it. Where did you leave the tank?

DORA
It’s on the stairs.

GUIDO
Hold the bicycle. I’ll get it

Guido goes to the stairs and gets the toy.

GUIDO
There, let’s go.

He joins his parents, who are waiting for him next to a bicycle in front of the door to the house.
Dora settles the little boy on the bike’s handlebars. She sits on the cross-bar.

SCENE 35
THE CITY STREETS—EXT., DAY
It is a sunny, hot summer, but people aren’t very happy. There are few passersby; a woman

hurries along the sidewalk. Every once in a while, a German army truck goes by, or a soldier on a
motorcycle. The Orefice family bicycle comes into view, speeding along over Dora’s protests and
ms

59

Joshua’s excitement. First one street, then another. But everything is different from the way it
was before. Tragic, desolate signs of war are everywhere. Shop windows are taped over;
apartment windows are covered with heavy carton paper or newspaper. The city’s public statues
and monuments have been wrapped protectively in old mattresses bound with string. Sandbags
are piled between the columns of the porticoes. Strange, foreboding posters showing helmets,
skulls, swastikas, and rifles and urging final victory have been tacked up on the walls by the
regime.

JOSHUA
Come on, Pop!

DORA
Take it easy! Easy! You’re both crazy.

GUIDO
‘We'll be late for school.

JOSHUA
Go, go, go...

GUIDO
There’s a horse! Two horses!

He rings the bike’s bell like mad.
SCENE 36
THE CITY—EXT., DAY

The square and the Francesca Petrarca school. The bicycle’s bell is ringing madly as the three
crazy cyclists break into the square and head for the school’s entrance.

DORA

Guido, stop ringing that bell, it’s driving me crazy!
GUIDO

It’s not me, it’s Joshua!

JOSHUA
No, it’s not me, it’s Pop!

DORA
That’s enough, let me down.

GUIDO
Here we are. See you tonight.
—

The bike starts to brake and stops in front of the school entrance. Dora gets off, and Guido playfully
reaches for her rear end. She moves away, fixing her skirt. She walks faster. Guido leaves with
Joshua, on the crossbar now, ringing the bell.

JOSHUA
Go fast, Pop!

SCENE 37

THE CITY STREETS—EXT., DAY

Father and son proceed on foot. Guido pushes the bicycle by its handlebars. They pass a small
group of German soldiers. The two stop in front of the pastry shop. There are only a few pastries

in the window, but there is a sign that says NO JEWS OR DOGS ALLOWED. Joshua stops and stares...
at a pathetic-looking chocolate cake.

JOSHUA
Should we buy this for Mommy?

GUIDO
How much is it?

JOSHUA
Fifteen lire.

GUIDO

No, forget it, forget it! it’s a fake. It’s probably a fake cake like
your tank. Let’s go, Joshua.

Guido walks ahead while the little boy reads the sign. He catches up to his father.

JOSHUA
Why aren't Jews or dogs allowed in the shop, Daddy?

GUIDO
‘Well, they don’t want Jews or dogs. People do as they please!
There’s a hardware store over there, they won’t let Spaniards or
horses in. And what’s-his-name, who has the drugstore—just
yesterday I was standing there with a Chinese friend and his pet
kangaroo. “No, no Chinese or kangaroos allowed!” He doesn’t
like them.

Father and son move off, backs to the camera, along the sad city street.

JOSHUA
But we let everyone in!
61

GUIDO
Yeah, well, starting tomorrow, we’re going to have a sign too.
Who don’t you like?

JOSHUA
Spiders! And you?

GUIDO
Visigoths! And tomorrow we're going to write a sign that says
“No Spiders or Visigoths Allowed.”

He walks faster.
GUIDO (almost to himself)
That’s it, I’ve had it with those Visigoths!
They turn a comer.
SCENE 38

THE BOOKSHOP—INT.-EXT., DAY

Joshua is on his knees on a chair in front of a counter, and is drawing with crayons on a sheet of
paper. He is reciting a nursery rhyme to himself. His father is arranging books on the shelf: He is
holding a pile of books in his hands, his chin clamped on the top book to hold the pile steady. It is
a modest bookshop, but a happy one, and quite tidy. There are books and also notebooks, rulers,
compasses, colored pencils... A man with an arrogant air comes in; another man waits outside
with a cigarette in his mouth. Guido greets the customer with a smile: He can’t believe his eyes.

CUSTOMER
Good moming.

The books slide out of Guido’s hands to the ground; he steps over them.

GUIDO
At your service! Everything half price!

CUSTOMER
Are you Orefice, Guido?

GUIDO
Tam. What can I do for you?

CUSTOMER
Come with me to Police Headquarters.

GUIDO
Again?
62

JOSHUA
He’s already been there.

GUIDO (to the customer)
What do you need me for?

He sees the man outside put out his cigarette by squashing it up against the shop window.
GUIDO
Is that man with you?

CUSTOMER
Yes. Let’s go!

Joshua starts getting off the stool.

JOSHUA
T’'m coming too!

GUIDO
No, no. You stay here, I°l] be right back.
(to the customer)
It won’t take long, right?

CUSTOMER
No, not Jong at all.

Guido takes his jacket from the hook.

GUIDO
Okay, let’s go!
(to Joshua)
And you, careful how you treat the customers!

He goes out the door first. Outside, he greets the other man.

GUIDO
Good morning!

The man doesn’t speak. Then the three men, Guido in the middle, move on. Joshua is looking out
the window. Guido realizes it and does a funny goose step to amuse his son, then turns and winks
at him.

SCENE 39

THE BOOKSHOP-—INT., DAY

Joshua picks up the books that his father dropped on the floor and replaces them on the shelf. He
is humming his tune again. His grandmother, Laura, comes into the bookshop. She is pale, her

eyes shining with emotion.

LAURA
Hello,

JOSHUA
Hello.

She pretends to look at the books, moving slowly. But she doesn’t take her eyes off her grandson,
who is erasing a line on his drawing. She stops in front of him and stares at him. Joshua raises his
eyes. She picks up a book.

LAURA
Tl take this one.

She gives Joshua the book. He looks at the price and gives it back to her.

JOSHUA
That'll be five lire.

LAURA
It says ten lire here.

JOSHUA
Everything is half price.

She pays, and removes a sealed envelope from her purse. She puts it down in front of the child.

LAURA
Give this to your mother. Tell her it’s from your grandmother.
JOSHUA
I never saw my grandmother, I don’t know her.
LAURA
Would you like to meet her?
JOSHUA
Yes.
LAURA

Tomorrow you will.
JOSHUA
Tomorrow?

LAURA
Yes, because it’s your birthday. Grandma’s coming and she’s
going to bring you a very nice gift.

JOSHUA
A new tank?

LAURA
No, it’s a surprise. Give the letter to your mother. "Bye, Joshua!

She turns, and is about to leave.

JOSHUA
Grandma, you forgot your change!

She takes the money, staring at him. And leaves, still emotional but smiling.
SCENE 40
THE BOOKSHOP-—EXT., NIGHT

It is dark. A few streetlights are lit. Guido is closing the store. This time, Dora is sitting in the
bike seat. Joshua is on the crossbar. Guido closes the door.

DORA (to Guido)
When will you be home?

GUIDO
Less than an hour. I’m going to Uncle’s to see if he’ll bring
leftovers.

DORA
"Bye.

Dora tums the bike. She is talking to Joshua.

DORA
Then what did Grandma say?

JOSHUA
She’s coming tomorrow.

He starts ringing the bell.
, GUIDO (to himself)
! It’s about time.

Guido pulls down the store’s shutter, on which is painted, in big letters, JEWISH STORE.
SCENE 41

UNCLE’S HOUSE. THE LARGE ENTRANCE AND DINING AREA—INT., DAY

Uncle's house has changed: Now it’s a real house, serious and bright. Against one wall is the
dining-room table and chairs. There are pieces of old furniture, an armoire, a broken-down night
table, a chest of drawers, and different odd pieces. Another part of the room is the living room.

Guido is moving the table. Dora enters in a hurry, followed by Joshua. She has a painting in her
hands, which she puts in a comer, then turns to her son.

DORA

And now it’s time for your bath.
JOSHUA

No, I don’t want to take a bath!
DORA

‘Well, you have to. Go ahead.
JOSHUA

T took one Friday!
GUIDO

Right! He took one Friday.
DORA (to Guido)

And you, change your shirt.
GUIDO

I changed it Thursday.

Uncle appears in the kitchen doorway, wearing an apron. He has a ladle in his hand.

UNCLE
Don’t forget the flowers.

He goes back into the kitchen.

DORA (to Guido)
Didn’t you pick them yet? Go do it now.

Guido goes quickly to the door.
GUIDO
I did pick them, I put them out here.

JOSHUA
I’m coming too.

DORA
No, you go take your bath.

JOSHUA
I don’t want to take one!

DORA
Hurry up, I have to go pick Grandma up.

The child doesn’t move. Guido goes toward the door.

JOSHUA
I took a bath Friday.

He goes out. Dora opens the armoire and starts looking through the drawers. She goes into the
bedroom and closes the door. Joshua stays in the living room. He sees the night table, which is
bottomless and whose one drawer is broken, and gets into the piece of furniture through its front
cabinet door, which he closes as Guido comes into the room with the flowers in his hand.

GUIDO (loudly)
Where should J put the flowers?

DORA’S VOICE
Leave them there, Ill be right out.

The wildflowers are tied with string. Guido puts them down on the night table, where Joshua is
hiding. He tums to go, but hears a faint little hiccough. He turns and sees Joshua’s hands and
eyes through the night table’s broken drawer.

JOSHUA
Shhh...] took one Friday.

Dora, hairbrush in hand and her hair loose, comes into the room.

DORA
Isn’t Joshua with you?
GUIDO
No!
~ DORA

Then where is he?
67

She sits down at the table, a few steps from the night table, and starts brushing her hair.

DORA
Listen—come here, I have to talk to you before I go to pick up
my mother.

Guido sits down next to her.

DORA
Hang the painting there—see if it looks okay. And where did
you put the flowers?

GUIDO
They’re on the night table.

DORA
Bring them here so I can see them.

GUIDO
Coming up!

He stretches his hands out toward the night table and wiggles his fingers. He has a mysterious
Jook on his face.

GUIDO
Come, flowers, come night table. Schopenhauer, the will. | want
the night table to come here....

Dora, puzzled, watches him, then tums her head immediately, because the night table is rising
slightly from the ground. Beneath it Joshua’s feet appear. Then the night table moves forward in
tiny steps. Dora, over her surprise, understands the trick and smiles. But she is in a hurry.

DORA
This is a very dirty night table.

The night table stops in front of Dora. The cabinet door opens and Joshua appears.

JOSHUA
Good moming, Princess.

DORA (loudly and sternly)
Go take your bath!

Dora leaves the room. From behind the bedroom door, Dora’s warm, happy giggles can be heard.
68

SCENE 42
UNCLE’S HOUSE—EXT.-INT., DAY

The buggy, drawn by Robin Hood and carrying Dora and her mother, stops outside Uncle’s
house.

LAURA
He can already read and write?

DORA
It’s more than a year now.

LAURA
You’ve done a good job.

DORA
T’ll help you get down, Mother.

Laura doesn’t want any help, she gets down from the buggy with Joshua’s gift in hand. But
something has already upset Dora... The house doors are wide open: Smashed on the ground is
Joshua’s Pinocchio doll.

LAURA (alarmed)
What is it, Dora?

Dora doesn’t answer. Going more pale by the minute, she goes to the door and looks inside... The
table is still set, but a chair is toppled over. There is a broken plate on the floor. She steps
backward, terrified.

SCENE 43
ARMY TRUCK—INT., DAY

The truck’s waxed canvas cover is burning hot. In the truck, people are sweaty, tired, frightened,
and exhausted. They have been traveling for some time. They have luggage in their hands and
laps, and are seated on benches. The children sit on the floor of the truck. On the far end of the
bench, behind the driver's cabin, are Guido and Joshua. Uncle, silent, sits on the bench facing
them. At the other end of the benches, near the hatchback, two German soldiers are half asleep,
machine guns on their laps and helmets in hand. The truck stops and the engine is quiet. In the
silence the only sound is the long, monotonous drone of crickets. Joshua stands up.

JOSHUA
Are we there?

Through the window behind the driver’s cabin, Guido sees two Tealian soldiers.
GUIDO
No, it’s a railroad crossing.

Joshua sits on his father’s lap and looks at a little girl sitting on the bench in front of him. She is
petting a kitten.

JOSHUA
Pop, come on, tell me where we’re going.

GUIDO

He hesitates, then improvises.
We’re...uh, we're going to...what’s the name of that
place?...You’ve asked me a thousand times, and J told you: I
can’t tell you!

JOSHUA
Uncle, where are we going? I’m so tired...

UNCLE (embarrassed)
‘We're going...
(BUT HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY)
GUIDO
Joshua, what do you mean, “Where are we going?” Come on,
didn’t you understand what I told you?
Joshua shakes his head no.

GUIDO
Okay, what's today?

He smiles.
Your birthday, right? You said you wanted to take a trip, didn’t
you? I’ve spent months planning this—come on, Joshua!

JOSHUA
Where are we going?

GUIDO
We're going...we're going...

He looks for an answer, but can’t think of one. The child insists.

JOSHUA
Where?

Guido, with a sly, conspiratorial look, lowers his voice.
70

GUIDO
No, I can’t tell you. You know, I promised Mommy. If she finds
out I told you she’ll be angry at me. You know how she is. It’s a
surprise. It’s—it makes me laugh. My daddy organized the same
thing for me when I was little boy, will you laugh! Look, first
we're going...when you get there, you'll see something and
you'll say, “Oh!” but we won’t be there Jong. Then a bell goes...

JOSHUA
But where are we going?

Joshua smiles faintly, then yawns. A fast train goes by in front of the truck, and when it has
passed, the truck starts on its way again.

JOSHUA
I’m tired.

GUIDO
Go on, sleep a little!

A second later, Guido stares into Uncle’s eyes with a worried and disbelieving expression.

GUIDO (whispering)
Uncle, where are they taking us? Where are we going?

SCENE 44
THE TRAIN STATION PLAZA. A CAR—INT.-EXT., DAWN

Dora, tense, desperate, and speechless, is sitting in the backseat of a taxi. Outside the rear
window is the peaceful countryside, caressed by the dawn sunlight. The driver, in smock and
beret, slows down and stops in the plaza in front of the station. German and Fascist soldiers are
standing guard. An armored car, a truck, and a German army jeep are stopped outside the
entrance, which is patrolled by two armed guards. The taxi stops a short distance from the door.
Dora gets out.

CABBIE
Should I wait for you?

DORA
No, you go ahead.

She walks with a confident gait toward the station entrance, her purse in hand, as the cab drives
away.
71

SCENE 45
THE STATION. THE STATION MASTER’S OFFICE/PLATFORM—INT.-EXT., DAY

Dora is sitting in the stationmaster’s office, surrounded by electrical equipment, controls, and
telegraphic apparatus. She is looking straight ahead out the window at a freight train stopped on
the first train track. The sides of the train’s cars are slatted and the slats are nailed shut. But
through the openings, heads are visible, and frightened glances. Farther down the track are the
open cars. The new prisoners are getting in one at a time. But it is too far from Dora, and she
can’t see Guido, her son, or Uncle. The new prisoners move toward the freight cars, pushed by
German soldiers. Guido, Joshua, and Uncle are the last in line. Guido holds the child by the hand.

GUIDO
‘What time is it? Looks like we’re leaving right on time! What
organization! You’ ve never been on a train, have you, Joshua?

JOSHUA
No. What's it like? Is it nice?
GUIDO
Fantastic. Inside there’s all wood, no seats. Everybody stands.
JOSHUA
No seats?
GUIDO

Obviously you’ ve never been. Are you kidding, seats on a train? Everybody
stands, very close to everybody else. It’s real fun.

They are approaching the freight car.

GUIDO
Look at this line. I made it just in time to get the last tickets—it
was a miracle. Come on, Uncle, let’s go, we don’t want them to
tell us we’re too late. “Car’s full, go home!”

They start to board, but someone up ahead stops, exhausted.

GUIDO
Hold it, we have reservations, stop right there.
(LOUDLY)
‘We're here! Easy, easy—here we are, we’ ve got reservations.
Whoa!

The German soldier pushes him into the car.

GUIDO (smiling)
Thanks!
72

Once inside, he rubs his hands together happily. They are the last to board. The freight car doors
close before their eyes.

GUIDO (happily)
All aboard!

SCENE 46
INT. STATION MASTER’S OFFICE.

A German OFFICER who speaks Italian enters the stationmaster’s office. He is in a hurry.
Dora turns.

OFFICER (in a German accent)
Can E help you, Signora?

DORA
There’s...there’s been a mistake.

OFFICER
Mistake? Who are you?

DORA
My husband and my son are on that train.

OFFICER
What’s your husband’s name?

He starts looking through papers on the table.

DORA
Guido Orefice.

The officer looks quickly at a list and raises his eyes.
OFFICER
Joshua Orefice and Eliseo Orefice are also on the train. Where is
the mistake? There’s no mistake.

DORA
T want to get on the train too.

An ITALIAN SOLDIER appears at the office door and stands at attention.

TTALIAN OFFICER
Ready!
73

GERMAN OFFICER
Then let’s go!

To Dora.
Go home, Signora, go home.

Dora doesn’t move; her expression is hard. Beyond the window, an Italian soldier blows a
whistle and shouts an order.

ITALIAN SOLDIER
Go, go—you can leave!

The train’s engine starts up.

DORA
1 want to get on that train.

The German officer is about to leave the room. He stops on the threshold and takes a long look at
Dora. The train has started moving.

DORA (implacable)
Let me on that train!

The German officer sticks his head out the door and orders, in German,

GERMAN OFFICER (in German)
Alt—Stop the train!

The Italian soldier jumps to obey. He blows his whistle and shouts,

ITALIAN OFFICER
Stop! Brake, brake!

The German officer steps back and lets Dora go through to the platform.
Through one of the slats on the train, someone sees...
Dora coming out of the station office, accompanied by a German soldier.

JOSHUA'S VOICE
It’s Mommy!

In the space between the slats, Guido’s face appears next to Joshua's. Both are looking out.
Guido is holding the child in his arms. Uncle's face appears. They see Dora in front of another of
the train’s freight cars, not far from theirs, waiting for the door to open.

GUIDO (in a murmnr to himself )
74

JOSHUA (happily)
They stopped the train so Mommy could get on.

The long “livestock” train is standing still, waiting for the last traveler to board. It is Dora, who
nears the freight car and climbs up. Two German soldiers close the sliding doors and bar them
shut. One of the two blows his whistle sharply, and the train starts to move.

SCENE 47
THE CONCENTRATION CAMP YARD—EXT., NIGHT

This is where the train arrives. The tracks end at a heavy iron and wood fence in the foreground
of a large dirt yard surrounded by dank, gray-brick barracks with small, iron-barred windows.
Brutal, white spotlights scan the yard. There isn’t a soul in sight. A few shadows move in the
distance, near the main gate, a massive cement structure at the far end of the yard. Barbed wire

on the fences gleams under the roving spotlights, as if moved by invisible hands. Finally, a tiny
light appears in the distance in the opening between the two main gates. As the light nears,
growing brighter and brighter, the sound of a train slowly chugging to its long stop gets louder
and louder. Puffs of steam blow from the flanks of the locomotive. Two trainmen jump down and
disappear into the dark. The train is immersed in the silent night.

SCENE 48
THE CAMP YARD—EXT., DAY

A German officer leans out the window of the top floor of a German army barracks. He is
wearing an undershirt; his suspenders droop from the waist of his pants. He is drinking coffee
and looking down at the yard. . . where the train is still stopped. On both sides of it, armed
German guards, four per freight car, are opening the doors and setting up exit ramps. The sun is
peeping through a brick wall topped with barbed wire. The women exit on one side of the train,
the men on the other, prodded by sharp commands, threats, and shoves. Mysterious messages in
German are broadcast from loudspeakers scattered throughout the yard. As soon as he is out of
the train, Guido, ignoring the confusion, hands the half asleep Joshua to his uncle and goes
looking for Dora. But the women are on the other side. He can only see her from afar, through
the open doors of one of the cars. Dora is also looking for him in the crowd of men, but can’t find
him. She is distraught with exhaustion and blinded by the light.

Guido jumps up on one of the links between two freight cars.

GUIDO (calling)
Dora...

SCENE 49
THE CAMP; GUIDO’S BARRACKS—EXT.-INT., DAY

Ina ragged line, the men walk slowly alongside a gray wall in front of the prisoners’ dormitories.
Nearly all carry a suitcase, a bundle, or a bag which they must leave at the door of their assigned
75

dormitory before entering. German soldiers check that order is maintained. The dormitories are
squalid buildings with small, barred windows from behind which disheveled, white faces with
large, spooky eyes watch the proceedings. Guido, almost at a run, catches up to Uncle and
Joshua, who are walking unsteadily. He takes the child by the hand; on Guido’s face is an
expression of the utmost calm.

GUIDO
So, Joshua,-how goes it? You're happy, right? Get a load of this
place. How are you doing? A little tired?

JOSHUA
Yes. I didn’t like the train.

GUIDO
No? Then we’ll take the bus home...
(YELLS LOUDLY TO THE OTHERS ON LINE)
Listen, guys, we’re taking the bus back! The bus with seats!
(TO JOSHUA)
T told them!

JOSHUA (to himself)
Yes, it’s better.

GUIDO
T think so too.

At the first door, the Germans choose some prisoners, take their baggage, and order them to
enter. When those barracks are full, the line moves on.

GUIDO
Look at that organization! Did you see those soldiers? You have
to stand in line to get in. People try to sneak in every which way,
but they have to stand in line outside, and the guards check
everyone. Look, they didn’t let those two in!

In fact, two prisoners are taken away mysteriously.

GUIDO
Don’t worry, though, they’ let us in, I reserved! See, Joshua?
‘We're going to have a great time!

JOSHUA
Daddy, what’s the name of this game?

GUIDO
Right! The name of the game? It’s the thing game, the one I told
you about! We’re all playing, got it? The men here, the women
over there. Then there are the soldiers. Then they’II give us the
76

schedule. Not so easy, is it? No, not easy. If you make a mistake,
they send you right home. But if you win, you get first prize.

JOSHUA
‘What do you win, Daddy?
GUIDO (hesitates)
You win—first prize! I told you!
JOSHUA
Yes, but what’s the prize?
Guido is having a hard time.
GUIDO
It’s...it’s...
Uncle comes to his rescue.
UNCLE
A tank!
JOSHUA
J already have a tank!
GUIDO

No, a real one. Brand new!
Joshua stops, open-mouthed.

JOSHUA
Areal one?

He is ecstatic.
No!

GUIDO
Yes! I didn’t want to tell you.

JOSHUA
How do you get to come in first?

GUIDO
Pl tell you later.

JOSHUA
A real tank!
77

GUIDO
Areal one!

At the next door, the soldiers make some prisoners enter, Guido and Joshua among these. But
Uncle is forced to continue walking with the other men.

JOSHUA
Where is Uncle going?

GUIDO
To another team, it’s all been planned.

He waves.
"Bye, Uncle!

As they enter the barracks, they stop, frightened. It is a filthy, nauseating room with dank stone
walls and dull light coming through the small windows. Bunk beds, piled three high, line the
walls around a small space in the center of the room where the new arrivals are crowded together.
About half the beds in the room are taken by emaciated, silent young men aged by fatigue. Here
and there, faces peek out from the covers, smiling in friendship and solidarity. Guido has to
recharge, because Joshua is about to burst into tears. He rubs his hands together exaggeratedly.

GUIDO (pleased)
Ah, didn’t I tell you? Is this amazing, or what?
(LOUDLY)
‘We reserved two singles!

He and Joshua go to the first free bed they find on the bottom row.

GUIDO
Quickly, or they'll take our space.

Father and son will share a bed, the first available bunk they find in the bottom row. The two
bunks above are already taken. The little boy is sad—he doesn’t like this place. He sits down on
the bed, with tears in his eyes. His father sees.

GUIDO

Okay, we sleep here, we'll snuggle up. Joshua!
JOSHUA

I's ugly here, it stinks. I want to go to Mommy!
GUIDO

We will.
JOSHUA

I'm hungry. ~
78

, GUIDO
( We're going to eat, Joshua.

JOSHUA
And they’re really mean, they yell.

GUIDO
They-have to, there’s a big prize, so they have to be really tough
because everybody wants that tank, Joshua!

JOSHUA
So what do you have to do? Can I see Mommy?

GUIDO
When the game’s over.

BARTHOLOMEYW, a longtime prisoner, thin as a rail inside his striped uniform, looks down
from the highest bunk bed and listens sorrowfully.

JOSHUA
And when is the game over?

GUIDO
You have to get a—a thousand points. Whoever gets them first
wins the tank.

JOSHUA
The tank? I don’t believe it.
(HE WHIMPERS.)
Do we get a snack?

GUIDO (surprised)
A snack? We'll see. Let me ask, we’re all friends here.

He looks up and sees Bartholomew, who has been listening to the conversation.

GUIDO
‘Well, look who’s here! See who’s here? It’s what’s-his-name....

BARTHOLOMEW
Bartholomew.

GUIDO
Uh, Bartholomew, has the bread and jelly man come by yet?

Bartholomew, his expression unchanged, nods his head.
79

GUIDO
1 knew it, we missed him! He’ll come by again, won't he?

Bartholomew shrugs his shoulders. Just then an SS CORPORAL comes in with two armed
soldiers. The corporal is a pudgy man with a stem air about him. He looks over his shoulder as
though waiting for someone. But he’s in a hurry.

CORPORAL (in German)
Any of you Italians speak German?

No one says a word, they are too frightened. Guido says in a whisper to Bartholomew,

GUIDO (whispering)
What did he say?

BARTHOLOMEW Very softly)
He’s looking for someone who speaks German. He’s going to
explain the camp nules.
Guido promptly raises his hand.

BARTHOLOMEW (very softly)
You speak German?

The corporal motions Guido to come stand next to him.

GUIDO (very softly as he moves)
No.

Guido takes his place next to the corporal, who immediately starts yelling loudly at the prisoners.

CORPORAL (in German)
Attention! I’m only going to say this once!

He looks at Guido, waiting for a translation.
GUIDO
Okay, the game begins! If you’re here, you’re here, if you’re

not, you’re not!

CORPORAL (in German)
‘You are here for one reason, and one reason only!

GUIDO (in Italian)
The first one to get a thousand points wins a real tank!

. CORPORAL (in German)
To work!
80

GUIDO
Lucky man!

The prisoners are trying to understand what the corporal and Guido are talking about, but only
Joshua gets it. He is standing very still, eyes popping. The corporal points to the yard outside.

CORPORAL (in German)
Any sabotage is punishable by death, sentence carried out right
here in the yard, by machine gun in the back!

He points to his own back.

GUIDO
Scores will be announced every morning on the loudspeakers
outside! Whoever is last has to wear a sign that says “jackass”—
here on his back!

Imitating the Corporal’s gesture, he points to his own back.

CORPORAL (in German)
You are privileged to work for our great Germany, building our
great empire!

GUIDO
We play the mean guys, the ones who yell! Whoever’s scared
loses points!

The corporal gets tougher. He holds up three fingers.

CORPORAL (in German)
There are three very important miles. One: Never attempt escape.
Two: Obey all orders without asking questions. Three: Any
attempt at organized riot will be punished by hanging.
(LOUDLY)
Is that clear?

GUIDO
You can lose all your points for any one of three things. One: If
you cry. Two: If you ask to see your mother. Three: If you’re
hungry and ask for a snack!
(LOUDLY)
Forget it!

CORPORAL (in German)
You should be happy to work here. Follow the rules and nothing
bad will happen to you.
81

GUIDO
It’s easy to be disqualified for hunger. Just yesterday, | lost forty points because
J absolutely had to have a jelly sandwich.

CORPORAL (in German)
Obey orders!

: GUIDO
Apricot jelly!
A German soldier whispers something in the corporal’s ear. He nods.

CORPORAL (in German)
One more thing:

GUIDO
He wanted strawberry!

CORPORAL (in German)
When you hear this whistle...

He sticks his fingers in his mouth to imitate.the whistle.

CORPORAL (in German)
...everyone out of the dormitory immediately!

Guido sticks his fingers in his mouth.

GUIDO
Never ask for lollipops! You can’t have any, they’re for us only!

CORPORAL (in German)
And form two lines!

GUIDO
J ate twenty yesterday!

CORPORAL (in German)
In absolute silence!

GUIDO
What a bellyache!

CORPORAL (in German)
Every moming...

GUIDO
But they were so good!
82

CORPORAL (in German)
+--Foll call!

GUIDO
Just forget it!

CORPORAL (in German)

Every two weeks you get a day of rest, no work.

GUIDO
Okay, it’s tough, but it’s fun, too.

The prisoners look lost—they don’t get it. But Joshua is paying close attention, not missing a
single word.

CORPORAL (in German)
That's it. Anything else you want to know, ask the veteran
Prisoners.

GUIDO

Yesterday, for example, I played ring-around-a-rosy all day.
Today, I’m playing hide-and-seek. A million laughs.

As he is about to leave, the corporal tums and adds,

CORPORAL (in German)
And that’s all I have to say.

GUIDO
Sorry, gotta run.

The corporal points into the distance.
CORPORAL (in German)
The work areas are there. But you’!l figure out the layout here
soon enough.

The corporal goes toward the exit.

GUIDO
I’m playing hide-and-seek, gotta go before they find me.

The corporal leaves, followed by the soldiers, who close the door. After a moment or two, the
new prisoners rally around Guido.

A YOUNG MAN
I'm sorry, but...
83

Guido goes to Joshua.

GUIDO (to the young man)
Don’t ask me, ask Bartholomew, he knows everything! Don’t
forget to tell me what he said too.

Everyone goes toward Bartholomew, who climbs down from his bunk.

GUIDO (to Bartholomew)
Later, tell me what the guard said.

Joshua’s face has a completely new expression on it. He is absolutely convinced that all this is
one big game.

JOSHUA
A thousand points?

GUIDO
told you! We're going to have fun.

SCENE 50
THE CAMP; THE FOUNDRY—INT., DAY

It is an immense, hot, noisy foundry. The prisoners, in striped uniforms, work incessantly under
the lazy gaze of armed guards and in the midst of molten metal, sparks, heavy machinery, dust,
soot.... The place is an inferno. Guido, his tongue hanging out, is on his knees, carrying a
gigantic anvil and moving along ever so slowly. He takes a step and seems about to fall over.
Suddenly, he finds himself in front of a staircase. It takes him by surprise. He stops and blinks.
He looks up, studying the staircase. He turns to VITTORIO, one of his roommates, who isn’t far
behind, also carrying an anvil in hand.

He starts walking, swaying.

GUIDO
They’re half crazy!

They go toward the oven doors.
GUIDO
This has to weigh one hundred kilos! It must be three thousand
degrees in here. J can’t do it, Vittorio. I can’t cope anymore!
His arms pull him down farther and farther to the ground.

VITTORIO
After only the first one? ~
GUIDO
Why, are there more to move?

VITTORIO
We're here until tonight!

Slowly, Guido picks up the anvil, then goes to get another anvil. Bartholomew is also behind
him. They stop in front of.2 mountain of anvils. They are surrounded by gigantic piles of iron
objects that have been unloaded from freight cars. Guido looks at the anvils. Another prisoner is
taking a piece of iron out of one pile. A straight razor is stuck under the piece, and the prisoner,
pulling the razor free, falls backward. The blade goes flying and wounds Bartholomew in the
arm. He falls to the ground with a yell, as a spot of blood appears on the tom sleeve of his
uniform.

GUIDO
Bartholomew, what happened? Where are they taking you?

One of the German guards rushes over threateningly, shoves aside the prisoner who wounded
Bartholomew, and orders the wounded man to get up.

BARTHOLOMEW (in German)
To the hospital. I hurt my arm. .

The guard motions him to leave. And follows him.
GUIDO (to Vittorio)
We're going to die here! J can’t take it anymore! I’m putting this
down. I'll tell them I can’t do it. What can they do to me?

VITTORIO
They'll kill you.

GUIDO
Good Lord, I'll never make it. It’s got to be ten thousand degrees
in here.
The guard points to the anvils.

GUARD (in German)
Work!

SCENE 51
THE CAMP; BARRACKS—INT., DAY

Little Joshua is seated on the bed, waiting for his father to come back. The prisoners enter the
room, wobbling with fatigue. They fall onto their beds, exhausted. They are all present except
85

Bartholomew and Guido. Joshua stares at the open door. Finally Guido appears. He comes in,
swaying as if drunk, but wearing a smile.

JOSHUA
Pop!

Guido, panting, shows him his striped uniform.

GUIDO
See this? Nice, right?

He sits on the bed where Joshua was. The child is now standing.

GUIDO (panting but smiling)
I signed us up. When I got to the desk the clerk said, “No, you
and your son aren’t on the list! You'll have to go home.... You
didn’t pay your dues!” I almost fell over. I said, “Get outta here!
Joshua and I are already signed up. Give me a number!” And he
gave me one!

Guido shows Joshua the number on his uniform.

GUIDO
Just to be sure, I had them stamp the number here too.

He shows Joshua his wrist where his prisoner number is tattooed.

GUIDO
I said, “Can I have a look at the tank?” He said, “No!” Fine;
never mind. Are you happy now? So, did you play with the
other kids today?

JOSHUA
Yes, but they don’t know any of the rules. They said it’s not true
that you win a tank. They don’t know about the points and
scores.

Guido takes a piece of bread from his pocket.

GUIDO
They know, they know. They're just being tricky, don’t fall for
it. Everyone wants that tank. What, no tank? Are we kidding
here?

JOSHUA
How many points did we get today?
86

GUIDO
Fifty! Actually, forty-eight, they deducted two points because I
tripped while I was playing hopscotch. But I had a great time, I
nearly died laughing. J can’t wait until tomorrow. Hopscotch,
tug of war, and ring around the rosy. Every game, ] don’t even
remember all of them. “You guys are obsessed. Stop, I’m tired!”
I said. Listen, did you eat something?

JOSHUA
Yes, but ] didn’t ask for any snack.

GUIDO
Excellent! So you got twelve points. I got forty-eight, you got
twelve, Wow—sixty points today! Sixty points got us this bread.
No jelly, though.
Joshua bites into the bread eagerly.

JOSHUA (chewing)
Sixty points? Is that a lot?

GUIDO
You bet! It’s a lot, no kidding.

Bartholomew enters, in pain, his arm bandaged under his shirt.

GUIDO
So, Bartholomew? How’d it go?

Bartholomew’s answer is to go slowly toward his bed.

BARTHOLOMEW
Couldn’t be worse! Twenty stitches! Er, points!
Guido shakes his head.
JOSHUA (softly, to his father)
‘We got more!

GUIDO (softly)
Shhh. Don’t tell him. We’re winning! Eat.

SCENE 52
THE CAMP; DORA’S BARRACKS; STAIRS; THE GAS CHAMBER—INT.-EXT., DAY

The women, in prison uniforms, are being led down a steep, narrow stairway. They are all young
prisoners. In front of one of the rooms on the top floor, a strict German WOMAN ATTENDANT,
87

in army uniform, stops an elderly woman who is about to start downstairs with the others. The
woman is still wearing civilian clothes, however tattered.

WOMAN ATTENDANT (with a German accent)
Old women and children inside! You don’t work!

Dora goes down the stairs with GIGLIOLA, a prisoner a few years older than she, a veteran of
the camp. Her uniform is messy and torn. On the floor below, a Second Woman Attendant is
waiting. Next to her is an armed soldier.

SECOND WOMAN ATTENDANT (with a German accent)
Move it, girls! Faster! Come on—over here!

Dora and Gigliola go down the second flight of stairs.

GIGLIOLA (to Dora)
She’s new, but she learned fast. The one upstairs who was
shooing us out... she was okay when she first got here, but now
she’s the worst of all!

DORA (in a tired voice)
At least the old women and children don’t have to work.
Maybe...

GIGLIOLA (interrupting her)
Listen, the old women and children don’t work because the
Germans are going to kill them all.

Dora’s hand goes to her heart. She stops, but Gigliola doesn’t notice.
GIGLIOLA
One of these days, they'll call them for a shower: ’Children,
shower time!” But the shower room here...

Gigliola stops at a window and points to a small, sinister-looking building not far away.

GIGLIOLA
«+is the gas chamber.

Dora, next to her, looks out. There is a big, iron gate which is closed. An armed guard is outside.
In front of the door is a long walkway, lined left and right with barbed wire. The first woman
attendant comes down the stairs at the end of the line of women.

FIRST WOMAN ATTENDANT (in German)
Lotte, open the other door! Let’s go, let’s go!
88

The women ahead of her go faster down the stairs. Dora, however, isn’t moving. She stands,
profiled against a window, looking out, her eyes filled with tears. The other prisoners are pushing
her toward the landing..

SCENE 53
THE CAMP; THE FOUNDRY—INT., DAY
Staggering, his tongue hanging out of his mouth, Guido is again carrying an anvil.

GUIDO
How can J do this? Vittorio! Where did they find these anvils?

JOSHUA (softly)
Pop! Pop!

Joshua appears from out of the shadows, where he has been hiding behind some machinery, and
goes calmly toward his father. Guido is panicked. He stops, resting the anvil on his knee.

GUIDO
What are you doing? You can’t come here! Get back into hiding,
what are you doing here? Why aren’t you with the other
children?

Joshua, staying in the shadows, weaves his way alongside his father.

JOSHUA
Because they said that today all the kids have to take a shower,
and I don’t want to take a shower!

GUIDO
Go right now and take that shower!

JOSHUA
No, I won’t! What are you guys doing here, Pop?

GUIDO
‘We're making...a...a tank. But we're way behind, we're still on

the treads.

 

The child wipes his nose with his sleeve.

GUIDO
See how dirty you are?
(STERNLY)
Go take that shower!
89

JOSHUA
No!

GUIDO
You stubborn thing! I’m going to tell Mommy! You’ll lose ten
points! You wait right here for me, don’t let anyone see you, and
we'll go back together. This sure is fun.

He keeps walking, until he is back in line with the other prisoners carrying anvils.
SCENE 54
THE CAMP; GAS CHAMBER; WAITING ROOM—INT., SUNSET

Uncle, silent and with a faraway look in his eyes, is slowly getting undressed. He takes off his
jacket and hangs it on a nail. The gas chamber’s large anteroom is lit by a few wall lamps.
Attendants and SS men check that all the elderly and the children are getting undressed.

ATTENDANT’S VOICE (in German)
Everything, take everything off. Get undressed and hang your
clothes there. You'll get everything back after the shower.
Remember your number to get your clothes back.

The second attendant tums, trips on something, and falls down with a cry. Uncle, his shirt already
unbuttoned, reaches down and gives her his hand, helping her to her feet.

UNCLE
Are you hurt, ma’am?

She notices him for the first time and backs away, staring into his face with a frightened, upset
look. Then she walks away with long strides. Uncle takes off his shirt.

SCENE 55
THE CAMP; GUIDO’S BUNK--INT., NIGHT

Under the artificial ceiling light, the prisoners, in their beds, look even more ghostly.
Bartholomew has moved into the lower bunk that was Guido and Joshua’s. He is tidying up. He
has traded his upper berth with father and son, who now sleep in the upper bunk. Guido prefers
the top berth because Joshua can hide more easily from anyone coming in or out of the room.
Joshua is climbing up, pushed by Guido.

GUIDO
Thanks, Bartholomew! Joshua, from now on you have to hide all
day! If they find you, it’s all over. They’l! disqualify us.

JOSHUA
And what am I supposed to do all day?
90

GUIDO
Don’t let anyone see you, especially the bad guys who are
always yelling.

Joshua lies down on the bed and disappears from his father’s sight.

JOSHUA
T have to stay here all the time?

GUIDO
No, no! J’j] take you with me, don’t worry! I'l hide you! This is
the hardest part, because if no one finds you, we win the tank!
We'll make a hundred twenty points a day on this one! You're
not even here. No one’s ever set eyes on you! You disappeared!

Got it?
Joshua doesn’t answer.
GUIDO
Joshua?
The little boy’s smiling face appears.
GUIDO
Uh-oh. I saw you!
Joshua disappears.
GUIDO (satisfied)
Excellent!

SCENE 56
THE CAMP; ONE OF THE STRUCTURES—INT., DAY

Dora and the women from her bunk are working in the shadow of an immense, dirty hut. It is
pitiful, heart-wrenching work. Dora is standing in front of a big heap of clothing. Her job is to
separate hats, shoes, glasses, clothing, gloves—and put them on long portable tables made of
planks and sawhorses. She works with deep respect, her throat tight with pain, because she is
afraid that any minute she will come across something of Joshua's or Uncle’s. Amongst the rags,
a litle kitten is moving around, sniffing as if looking for someone or something.

SCENE 57.
THE CAMP; A NARROW LANE; AN OFFICE—EXT., DAY

On top of a very tall pole, four loudspeakers are hung at right angles..A voice is giving orders in
German to the army personnel.
91

LOUDSPEAKER VOICE (in German)
Attention, attention! The west gate will be closed for several
days. Heavy materials must be moved through the camp's north
exit.

In a jong, narrow lane, a group of prisoners are returning from work. Guido is among them,
pushing a rickety wheelbarrow filled with empty sacks and all sorts of debris. To his alarm, a
little hiccough is heard every once in a while from under the sacks. Around the corner, the group
of prisoners passes by a door that opens onto a lit room. A German soldier runs out of the room
and disappears down the street. Guido slows down abruptly; he’s got an idea. On the table inside
the empty office is a microphone. Guido doesn’t think twice. He looks around, and as the last of
the line of prisoners passes him by, he parks the wheelbarrow and goes into the office.

GUIDO
Anyone home? Am I intruding? Bitte!

There is no one. He turns and calls.

GUIDO
Joshua?

The little boy’s head pops up from under the sacks—with a hiccough.

GUIDO (in a low voice)
Come here, quick as lightning!

The boy goes into the office. Guido switches on the microphone and taps it with his finger. The
loudspeakers transmit the taps. He starts speaking, smiling broadly.

GUIDO (loudly)
Good morning, Princess!

Joshua approaches, very excited. He can’t stand still—as if he has to pee.

GUIDO
Last night...

The loudspeakers atop the pole are broadcasting Guido’s voice at full volume to every comer of
the camp.

GUIDO'S VOICE
I dreamt of you all night! We had been to the movies....

SCENE 58
92

THE CAMP; DORA'S WORK HUT—INT.-EXT., DAY

Dora is thoroughly stunned. She has no idea what is happening. The voice out of nowhere leaves
her frozen. She steps toward the door of the hut, looking around, searching the air.

GUIDO’S VOICE
You were wearing that pink suit I like so much! And now...

All of a sudden, after some brief static, the voice changes.

JOSHUA (happily)
Mommy! You should see! Pop takes me around in a
wheelbarrow, and he can’t drive! You'd die laughing! And we’re
winning. How many points did we get today, Pop?

GUIDO’S VOICE (interrupting)
Quick! Run! The bad guys, the ones who yell, they’re behind
US....

JOSHUA'S VOICE
Where?

GUIDO
Over there!

The microphone is still on; there is noise, static, the sound of running feet. Dora has been
listening apprehensively, her fists clenched tight. Her face lights up as the voices become
incomprehensible, hard, and guttural.

A SOLDIER’S VOICE (yelling in German)
Who was that? Who was the idiot who...

With a click, the transmission is over. Dora, coming out into the sunlight, looks up. A light
breeze blows her hair. Not far behind her, two other women look up into the sky.

SCENE 59
THE CAMP; BARRACKS—INT.-EXT., DAY

It is raining out. The sky is gray. Guido is leaning against the window looking out. He is very
thin, and tired. A grimy blanket covers his shoulders. Joshua’s voice startles Guido.

JOSHUA
Daddy, are they dry?

His father turns and looks up at the little boy, who is hidden in the top bed.
93

GUIDO
What? Oh—yes.

He quickly gathers up the clothes he has washed as best he can and dried in the open air and
throws them onto the bed.

GUIDO
Get dressed.

The door behind Guido opens suddenly, and several prisoners, dripping wet and looking
depressed, come in. One of them is Bartholomew, who sits down on his bed. Guido realizes that
many have not retumed.

GUIDO
Bartholomew, where’s Vittorio? And Alfonso and the others?

Bartholomew frowns as a German attendant appears at the door, followed by armed guards.
Joshua disappears into his bed; his father is watching from the comer of his eye.

ATTENDANT (in German)
Everyone else out!

The other half of the prisoners file out. Guido is last in line.
SCENE 60
THE CAMP; A LARGE; WHITEWASHED ROOM—INT., DAY

The prisoners, naked to the waist, are lined up against the wall for a medical exam. A camp
doctor, in a white coat, is standing in front of them; on one side of him is a woman attendant in a
white coat and on the other side a soldier aiming a revolver, ready to intervene at any moment.
The doctor’s back is to the camera, he is wearing white gloves. The medical selection
examination is taking place in a whitewashed room. In a distant comer, other army men are
seated at a crude table littered with coffee cups and papers. Guido watches the doctor approach
with amazement. After a quick examination of the prisoners, the physician gives his verdict to
the nurse, who writes it down in a notebook. The doctor checks eyes, hands and feet, gives his
verdict, and moves on. Now he is in front of Guido: it is him, no doubt about it. It is Dr. Lessing,
the man Guido knew years ago at the Grand Hotel. But the doctor doesn’t recognize him. He
examines him quickly, murmurs something to the nurse, and goes on to the next prisoner. Guido
screws up his nerve.

GUIDO
“Tf you say my name, I disappear.”

The doctor stops; the nurse is yelling something at Guido.

NURSE (in German)
Silence!
94

Lessing has turned to look at Guido, then turns back, motioning to the nurse. He looks at the
prisoner, the first prisoner he has looked in the eye.

GUIDO
“Silence!”

A slight smile lights up Lessing’s face. He takes a closer look.

DR. LESSING
The Grand Hotel!

Guido nods. The doctor moves on, thoughtfully, to inspect the hands of the next prisoner.

DR. LESSING (to himself)
Guido!

He continues examining the prisoners, but calls to one of the men seated at the table.

DR. LESSING (calling)
Franz?

A subaltern leaves the table and goes toward the doctor, who speaks to him rapidly, pointing to
Guido. The subaltem approaches Guido and gestures for Guido to follow him. Guido leaves the
line and goes with him.

SCENE 61
THE CAMP; GUIDO’S BARRACKS—INT., DAY

Guido comes in, dripping wet. He closes the door behind him. Bartholomew breathes a sigh of
relief.

BARTHOLOMEW
Guido, thank God! I was so worried. What happened to you?

Bartholomew, who has been standing, sits down on his bed. Less than half the original number of
prisoners is left in the barracks.

GUIDO
This is a loony bin! They're all crazy! The doctor, the captain
there—I knew him when J was a waiter. He says they’re giving a
dinner here for the officers and their wives, and he told me I
have to serve at the dinner. Maybe he wants to help me. He
might get us out of here.

(HE CALLS)

Joshua?

He gets down and looks around worriedly.
95

GUIDO (to Bartholomew)
Have you seen Joshua?

Bartholomew spreads his arms. A hiccough is heard from under one of the bottom beds.

GUIDO
Joshua!

He bends down and sees the little boy under the bed, eyes popping with fear.

GUIDO
Come out of there!

But the child won't move. His father pulls him out and helps him stand up. He dusts off his
jacket.

GUIDO
Look at this, you’re al} dirty! Now, when...

JOSHUA (unhappily)
Where were you?

GUIDO.
What? Oh—I was... I told you, I had to finish a card game.

JOSHUA
They make buttons and soap out of us.

GUIDO
Joshua, what are you talking about?

JOSHUA
They cook us in the ovens.

GUIDO
Who told you that?

JOSHUA
A man was crying and he said they make buttons and soap out
of us.

Guido bursts out laughing.

GUIDO
Joshua! You fell for it again! And here I thought you were a
sharp kid!

He smiles.
Buttons and soap. Right. And tomorrow moming I’m washing
my hands with Bartholomew and buttoning my jacket with
Francesco and my vest with Claudio...

He is laughing as he pulls a button off his jacket and lets it fall to the floor.

GUIDO
Uh-oh, Giorgio fell off!

He picks up the button and puts it in his pocket.

GUIDO
They make buttons out of people? What else?

JOSHUA
They cook us in ovens!

Guido stares at him and laughs.

GUIDO (laughing)
They cook us in ovens? I’ve heard of a wood-burning oven, but
I never heard of a people-buming oven. Oh, I’m out of wood,
pass me that lawyer over there! No, that lawyer’s no good, he’s
not dry! Come on, Joshua, get with it! Let’s get serious now.
Tomorrow morning there’s a sack race with the bad guys, and

JOSHUA (interrupting)
No, Pop, that’s enough, I want to go home,
GUIDO
Now?
JOSHUA
Right now.
GUIDO

Its raining now. You’! come down with a terrible fever!

JOSHUA
I don’t care. Let’s go.

GUIDO
Okay, you want to go home, we’ll go!

He gets onto the bed and folds the blanket.
97

JOSHUA (amazed)
Can we really go?

GUIDO
Sure! You don’t think they force people to stay here, do you?
(HE THINKS A MINUTE.)
‘We drop out, they cancel us. Too bad. We were winning, too.

He pretends to look for a suitcase.

GUIDO
Some other kid’s going to win the real tank.

JOSHUA
Which kid? There aren’t any more kids, I’m the only one left.

Guido jumps down from the bed.

GUIDO
No more kids? It’s full of kids, it’s busting with kids.

JOSHUA
‘Yeah? Where are they?

GUIDO
Hiding. They're not allowed to come out. It’s full of kids hiding.
It’s a serious game.

JOSHUA
i don’t get this game. How many points do we have?

Guido opens the barracks door. It is pouring outside.

GUIDO
Six hundred eighty-seven. I’ve told you a thousand times, we’re
first. We're winning! But never mind, we'll drop out. Let’s go!
saw the chart yesterday. We’ll go anyway, though. "Bye,
Bartholomew. Joshua and I are leaving. We're fed up here.

GUIDO (to Bartholomew)
The tank is done, it’s ready. Clean the spark plugs off before you
Start it. Open the throttle. Otherwise the cannon will get stuck
with the tracks. And the gun, did you see how nice it is? It came
out beautiful! Lift the emergency brake before you move!
Joshua and I are going. Joshua wants to quit. We could have
gone back with the tank soon, but we'll take the bus today.
Joshua and I are leaving. So long, everybody. We’ re tired of this
place. Let’s go, or we'll miss the bus.
98

JOSHUA
It’s raining, Il] come down with a terrible fever!

And he starts to move toward the door. He looks at the rain. Joshua is standing still, confused.
SCENE 62

THE CAMP; THE-YARD AND THE OFFICERS’ MESS—EXT.-INT., DAY

‘The four loudspeakers are transmitting one of Hitler’s speeches. From several windows of the
officers’ mess swastika flags and banners wave. All around the gloomy camp buildings are signs
of the recent rain, and mad everywhere. A German car stops at the entrance to the mess. Two
women and four beautifully dressed children get out. An officer and his wife greet them, smiling.
With the officer is another man in civilian clothes. They greet one another and introductions are
made. A second car is already Standing in the yard and a child, slightly muddied but also
beautifully dressed, is hiding behind it. His friend, a smaller boy, runs to hide behind a pile of
stones. Several German children who arrived earlier are playing hide-and-seek. Behind the
entrance door to the officers” mess, one little boy, eyes closed and hidden against his arm, is
counting.

LITTLE BOY (in German)
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

Guido is wearing a waiter’s uniform, several sizes 100 big for him. He is inside one of the
drawing rooms on the top floor of the officers’ mess, and is Setting the table with two male
German attendants, in uniform, and one female attendant. Hitler's voice can be heard through the
open window. The others leave the room and Guido is alone. He goes to close the window and
sees...The little boy counting, He then sees him run with another boy and hide in a doorway,
while the other children, hidden here and there and Teady to burst, peek out.

But it’s Guido who bursts out with an idea. He runs from the room.

SCENE 63
THE CAMP; GUIDO’S BARRACKS—INT., SUNSET

The room is empty. Joshua is on the bed, banging a spoon against the bucket on his head. When
he hears the door open, he quickly hides under the blanket. But it’s Guido, out of breath.

GUIDO
Joshua? It’s me, Pop! I have to tell you something important.
Come here!
SCENE 64
THE CAMP; A CORNER AND THE YARD—EXT., SUNSET

Father and son are walking very quickly down a deserted path.
99

| GUIDO
T’ve been trying to catch that little devil since this moming.

JOSHUA
Is there really a little boy?

GUIDO
- More than one—-there must be two thousand, they’re like mice,
they’re everywhere. But they know how to hide. They want that
tank, darn them!

They stop at a comer that opens onto the yard where the officers’ mess is located. Guido keeps
Joshua hidden behind him, and looks into the yard.

GUIDO
Stop! I think I saw him, he’s right near here.

A few steps away is a small hut with a metal door, about the size of a night table, which may
house the camp’s water main.

GUIDO
Look and see if he’s inside there, I'll stand guard here.

Joshua opens the door and jumps back.
A BLOND BOY hiding inside also jumps back, and signals Joshua to close the door right away.

BLOND BOY (in German)
Shhh! Close the door, close it! I’m in here!

Joshua closes the door and turns to his father triumphantly.

JOSHUA
He’s there, Pop! He’s there!

GUIDO
‘Was he blond?

JOSHUA
Yes!

GUIDO
Yep, that’s him, all right. His name is Swanz. He’s been hiding
there for three weeks. He was ranked second, and we’ve
eliminated him! Sooner or later, I'll find the others, too.

JOSHUA (softly)
How many are there?
100

GUIDO
It’s a wasps’ nest, it's full of them, I told you! All hiding!

JOSHUA
But where are they hiding?

GUIDO
Everywhere, I said!

Just then the woman attendant who was setting the table comes out of the officers’ mess. She is

chunky and efficient. She claps her hands and calls the children who have been playing hide-and-
seek.

WOMAN ATTENDANT (loudly, in German)
Children, that’s enough. Come inside now. Children?

Children come popping out. One was hiding behind a wall, two come out of the trunk of the
parked car, one comes out from behind the pile of stones, another jumps off a windowsill.
Joshua’s eyes are bugging out of his head.

JOSHUA
Pop!

GUIDO
T'll be damed, it’s a real hideout.

He points to them one by one.

GUIDO
Gottcha! Gottcha! Gottcha!

He tums and takes Joshua away fast. But the German attendant sees Joshua and thinks he is one
of the German children. She points a finger and calls out.

WOMAN ATTENDANT (in German)
Little one! You, over there! Come here! I said everyone inside!

Guido stops dead.

GUIDO
Holy smokes! She saw us.

JOSHUA
Are we out?

The attendant is walking quickly toward them.
101

GUIDO
No. Listen, she’s coming for you. This is where the silent game
begins.

WOMAN ATTENDANT (in German)

Well? What are you waiting for? Come on!

GUIDO (without moving his lips)
You have to be absolutely quiet all evening! Swear it!

Quickly he dusts Joshua’s clothes, straightens them, and buttons the boy’s jacket.

GUIDO
Swear it!

JOSHUA (happily)
I swear!

He crosses his index fingers and kisses them.
GUIDO
They talk so weird, you can’t understand a thing. But you stay
quiet! If we get through this, we win! It’s the last round, the
silent game!

The woman attendant takes Joshua by one hand, brushing him off with the other.

WOMAN ATTENDANT (in German)

The dirtiest of all! Come on!
But first she turns to Guido.

WOMAN ATTENDANT (In Italian)
Why are you here with the children?

GUIDO
I'm here to...

WOMAN ATTENDANT (in Italian)

Quiet! Never speak, understood?

GUIDO
I swear it!

He kisses his fingers. They go toward the officers’ mess. Before Guido runs off, he winks at his
son. And Joshua winks back.
102

SCENE 65
THE CAMP; OFFICERS’ MESS—INT., NIGHT

The German officers and their wives and children are having dinner. There are about a dozen
couples and a dozen children between six and twelve years old. There are two adjacent dining
rooms; a wide, open door is between the rooms. In one room, the adults sit at a long table. In the
other room, the children sit at a roundtable, some. quiet, some shouting. Guido is serving at the
adult table. Dr. Lessing doesn’t even look at him. An office, temporarily serving as a dining
room, has armchairs and sofas that don’t exactly match. Annoyed by the children’s noise, a
MAJOR, in uniform, rises and goes toward the other room.

MAJOR (shouting, in German)
That’s enough! Peter, Gretel...Be quiet while you’re eating!

The children shut up immediately. Joshua, mute, sees that the others have also stopped making
noise. He likes this game, it’s easy. And there’s food, lots and lots of food. Dr. Lessing finally
Jooks sneakily at Guido. The Italian waiter goes to his table and puts some bottled sauces down.
The two exchange glances. The doctor purposely drops a piece of silverware. Guido rushes to
pick it up. As he bends over, Lessing whispers to him.

DR. LESSING (in a whisper)
I must speak to you, it’s very important.

Guido is bending over.

GUIDO
‘Where? When?

DR. LESSING
T’'ll signal you later!
Guido picks up the silverware from the floor and takes it away. The children are eating in silence.
Guido serves the portions on plates which the GERMAN WAITER puts in front of the children.
When he serves Joshua, the little boy says,

JOSHUA (loudly)
Grazie!

The child realizes his mistake immediately. The realization is confirmed when he sees his father,
frightened, staring at him. The German waiter and several of the children look at him oddly.

GERMAN WAITER (in German to Joshua)
What did you say?

The child purses his lips.

GERMAN WAITER (in German)
What’s your name, little boy?

Joshua doesn’t answer. Guido doesn’t know what to do. The German waiter leaves the room
hurriedly, ignoring the plate that the Italian waiter is holding out to him. Guido follows him and
sees him go down the stairs. He goes back to the children. A moment later, the German waiter
comes back with a heavy-set woman soldier. They enter the room and stop at the door when they see
what is going on in the children’s dining room. Guido, his finger in the air like.a professor, is
teaching the German children how to say “thank you” in Italian. He puts a glass in front of one of
the children, who says,

FIRST CHILD
“Grazie!”

SECOND CHILD
“Grazie!”

GUIDO

No, not “crazie,” “grazie.” Grrr...
In unison the children, correcting one another, practice.

CHILDREN
“Grazie.” grr...grazie!. Crazie...crrr...No, “grazi.” Gh...gh...

With a look at the German waiter, the female soldier, dressed as a cook, spreads her arms wide.
She is in a hurry, but she goes to Guido with a stem look.

‘WOMAN SOLDIER (in Italian)
I said you are not to speak to the children!

(to the children, in German)
You children eat. No talking!

She leaves.

From an old-fashioned Victrola’s horn in the next room come the sweet notes of a delicate tango,
background to the officers’ and their wives’ evening. Dinner is almost over; people are leaving
the table and sipping drinks. Some are smoking, some laughing. Guido looks for Dr. Lessing.

The doctor is talking with a lady, who walks away when another friend calls her. Guido
approaches. He fills his German friend’s empty cognac glass.

GUIDO (very softly)
Doctor, my wife is here too.

DR. LESSING
Ah!
Just then the major, smiling, joins them.

MAJOR (in German)
Lessing, what’s going on? You seem worried these last few
days. Enjoy the evening.

Guido moves away, puts down the bottle of cognac, and goes to the children’s dining room. The
children, quiet as mice, are having dessert. Joshua's mouth is so stuffed, he can’t even swallow.
His father bends over his shoulder and says,

GUIDO (in a murmur)
Easy, Joshua. Eat slowly or you'll be sick. We’re in the lead and
the game’s almost over. We'll be going soon, Joshua! Don’t
make any mistakes now, okay?

He stands up straight and, moving away, winks at his son. Joshua winks back, hiding a smile. In
the other room, several couples are dancing. The other guests are cordially conversing. This time,
it is Dr. Lessing who moves toward Guido. Guido sees him. The doctor purposely spills his full
glass on a long table set up against the wall. He waves extravagantly at the Italian waiter.

DR. LESSING (loudly)
Here!

Guido runs up with a napkin and dries the table as the doctor turns toward him, his face
impassive and thoughtful.

DR. LESSING (softly)
Okay, Guido, listen carefully.

The doctor looks around one last time.
DR. LESSING (softly, but passionately)
“Fat and ugly as can be, and all yellow—that’s me. Ask me what
I am, I answer cheep, cheep, cheep!”
Guido is paying attention. He stops cleaning the table, paralyzed.

DR. LESSING (loudly)
“When I walk, I make poppo’, so who am I, do you know?”

Guido is astonished.

DR. LESSING (loudly)
The answer’s the Ugly Duckling, right?

He looks at Guido, nodding his head, then interrupts himself, vexed.
105

DR. LESSING
It is the Ugly Duckling—but it’s not! I haven’t slept in four
months. A veterinarian friend sent it to me from Vienna, and J
can’t send him mine until ] solve this one! “Fat and ugly as can
be”—it has to be the Ugly Duckling. But he said it isn’t! So what
is it? I thought maybe a platypus, but it doesn’t say cheep cheep!
The platypus goes frrr... frrr...

He takes a half step toward Guido.

DR. LESSING
I translated it into Italian for you last night. What do you think? Everything
points to the Ugly Duckling. Help, Guido!

Guido has stopped listening. Sadly, he feels his hopes crash. But the doctor, oblivious, keeps
mumbling.

DR. LESSING (to himself, in German)
“Fat and ugly as can be, and all yellow—that’s me. Ask me what
1am, Jack—the answer’s cheep, cheep, cheep!”

The record is finished; the phonograph needle is revolving around the empty space on the record.
Guido looks into the children’s dining room. They have finished eating and all have left the table
except Joshua, who is asleep at his place, head on his arms. Guido changes the record. He sees an
interesting one, and puts it on. It is Offenbach’s Barcarole. On the opening notes, a couple begins
to dance a slow waltz, holding one another tight. But when the song itself begins, Guido opens
the window wider and tums the Victrola horn toward the yard. Where it is night.

SCENE 66
THE CAMP; DORA'S BARRACKS—INT., NIGHT

The poignant notes of the Barcarole travel on the dense, low fog that enfolds the camp yard. This
music is Guido and Dora’s song. Now, the notes move through the moonlit haze and through the
dark streets of the immense camp, looking for Dora. In the moonlight, the iron bars over the
small windows shine brightly against the stones. Dora has gotten out of bed, drawn by the far-off
music. She approaches the window, opens it, and looks out. She sees the moon, outlined clearly
against the night, brightening the fog just over the officers’ mess, where the windows are lit up
on the top floor. The music is coming from there. She understands that it is for her—a serenade
for her.

SCENE 67
THE CAMP—EXT., NIGHT

It is as if the music is muted by the fog. Guido is in the yard, at the officers’ mess.
106

GUIDO
Okay, come on!

Joshua appears out of the fog. They rush off, but Guido, shrouded in the mist, is disoriented.

GUIDO.
Here!

They disappear. The fog lifts, they reappear. The camp’s white searchlight roams over the walls.
They disappear into the fog.

GUIDO'S VOICE
Where are we?

JOSHUA'S VOICE
Pop, I’m tired!

They reappear near a sort of workshop. But the fog is blinding. Joshua is asleep in his father’s
arms.

GUIDO
Where are we? J took a wrong tum, Joshua. Oh, good—you’re
asleep. Pleasant dreams. Maybe it’s really all a dream. Just a
dream, Joshua...

He is roaming aimlessly, the sleeping Joshua’s head resting on his shoulder.
GUIDO
Tomorrow moming Mommy’s going to wake us up with a nice
cup of warm milk and some cookies. First we'll eat, then ’ll
make love to her two or three times...
He comes out of the fog.

GUIDO’S VOICE
- lf T can!

He stops at a patch where the fog is thin—and the sight before his eyes turns him to stone. Facing
him is a mountain of corpses. Just behind the pile of bodies, the sinister arm of a crane used to
transport the dead bodies is sticking up into the air. Guido retreats and is swallowed up by the
white fog.

SCENE 68

THE CAMP; GUIDO’S BARRACKS—INT.-EXT,, NIGHT

Guido and Joshua are asleep in their miserable bed, arms around each other. But something is
happening in the camp, something amazing. The noise of trucks approaching and parking outside
107

the window wakes Guido brusquely; he looks out to see what is going on. Outside, the truck,
turning, stops; it is filled with prisoners, all standing, all terrified. Guido covers the still sleeping
Joshua with a blanket and climbs down from the bed. As soon as the truck moves off,
Bartholomew’s and others’ faces appear at the window with Guido. A rough voice, speaking
German, is heard over the loudspeakers.

GUIDO
Bartholomew...
BARTHOLOMEW
Shhh....
They listen.
VOICE OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER (in German)
Colonel Muller, report to Headquarters at once! Colonel Muller
to Headquarters! Lieutenant Grokemberger, to Headquarters
immediately!
Silence

BARTHOLOMEW
Sure. They’re probably in Australia by now!

Bartholomew’s eyes are bright with excitement and happiness. He tums to the others.
BARTHOLOMEW

They must have called those two officers to headquarters at least
twenty times. They’re long gone.

GUIDO
What else did they say?
He looks out the window.
BARTHOLOMEW

You don’t need to understand German, you can see for yourself.

Their faces are seen in the window from the outside. Against the glass, images of chaos are
reflected: men escaping, enlisted men on motorcycles, an officer giving abrupt orders to a
platoon that immediately disperses. Behind them, there is a small explosion.

BARTHOLOMEW
The war’s over. They’re running away.

GUIDO
So what about us? What happens to us?
108

BARTHOLOMEW
Who knows? They’ ve taken about fifty truckloads of prisoners
away. Either they’re going to kill us all, or... ] don’t know.

GUIDO
‘Where are the trucks going?

BARTHOLOMEW
Look, the important thing is not to get into one of the trucks.
They leave full and come back empty. Where do you think
they’re going?

GUIDO
What about the women? What's going on? We should get out of
here, split up, and take our chances. Don’t even pack, just go!

There are sounds of distant machine-gun fire and dogs barking.

BARTHOLOMEW
T’ve been hearing machine-gun fire and dogs barking for the last
six hours; they don’t want to leave any traces.

GUIDO
Good-bye, Bartholomew—see you in Viareggio. We'll start our
own business: an anvil company!

He climbs up the bunks to wake Joshua.
SCENE 69
THE CAMP; A YARD NEAR THE OFFICERS’ BARRACKS—-EXT.-NIGHT

A strong wind is blowing through the camp. Father and son are snaking their way down a dark
lane, trying to avoid the searchlight. Joshua’s shoulders are covered with a blanket. They stop at a
comer; the officers’ mess is across the street, a bonfire burning in front of the building.

GUIDO
Joshua, they’re really fighting mad this time!

JOSHUA
What? Who?

GUIDO
They’re furious at you! Everyone’s looking for you, don’t you
see? They’re tuming everything upside down to find you,
they’re even looking under rocks! You’re the last one, the only
one they haven’t found! Boy, are they mad! Get down—stop!
109

He bends over abruptly.

JOSHUA
What is it?

GUIDO
Nothing. I thought. ..Okay, tomorrow the game’s over and
they’re giving out the prizes. If you.can just stay hidden tonight,

we get sixty points!
JOSHUA
How many do we have now?
GUIDO
Nine hundred forty! Plus sixty makes...?
JOSHUA
A thousand!
GUIDO

First place! We win!
He looks around. In the wind, a soldier turns a corner.

GUIDO
‘Wow, they’re really hunting you down. See where that guard’s
looking? Boy, are they mad! No mistakes tonight, this is it! Go
hide in that box, quick.

JOSHUA
But that’s where Swanz is hiding!

GUIDO
‘Who?

JOSHUA
Swanz, Pop! The blond kid!

GUIDO
Right! Swanz! They got him yesterday. It’s the safest place now,
they won’t look there again. Take the blanket in case you get
cold, I’) be right back, I’m going 10 put them on the wrong track!
Go—one, two, three—go, Joshua!

Joshua takes off like a speeding bullet and hides in the small hut, which is about the size of a
night table.
110

GUIDO
I think I saw him over there!

He looks around and runs away.

SCENE 70

THE CAMP—EXT., NIGHT

Next to the barbed wire a mass of women is waiting to get onto the trucks. The wind is blinding.
~ Guido watches from afar; he moves in the shadows. He can’t get any closer: There are only
women and soldiers there. He turns back at a run.

SCENE 71

THE CAMP-——-EXT., NIGHT

Guido, pushed by the wind, disappears for a moment in the dark. He hides when the spotlight is
about to catch him, then moves on. He stops at a comer, where he sees the crane with its macabre
steel hand hanging in the air. Guido tums and runs...but trips on something, perhaps a body. He
keeps running, turns a corner again. At his back is the constant sound of gunfire.

SCENE 72

THE CAMP; NEAR THE OFFICERS’ MESS—EXT., NIGHT

In acloud of dust, Guido nears the box where Joshua is hiding. He opens it and sees the child.

JOSHUA
Pop, you scared me to death!

GUIDO
Give me the blanket. Are you cold?

JOSHUA
No.

GUIDO
Then let me have your jacket, too. I’ll throw it up onto a tree,
it'll throw them off track.
Joshua takes off his jacket.
GUIDO
You should see how angry they are, how they’re looking for

you!

He takes the jacket.
111

GUIDO
Okay, so long!

He turns back.

GUIDO
Joshua, if] should be a little late, don’t you move, don’t come
gut! You have to wait, don’t come out until it is absolutely quiet
and you can’t see anyone for miles. Just to be sure! Okay? Now
repeat what J just said.

JOSHUA
I can’t come out unti] there’s no one around.

GUIDO
Right! Stubborn boy!

He kisses Joshua on the forehead, closes the box, and runs off around a comer...where he stops,
pulls his trousers up over his knees, and ties the blanket around his waist. But suddenly he hears
a dog barking loudly nearby. He peers around the comer and sees...a German soldier walking a
German shepherd on a leash. The dog is barking at the metal box where Joshua is hidden; its
muzzle is practically inside the slot on the door. The soldier gives swift orders to the two soldiers
with him.
Guido panics. He doesn’t know what to do.

GUIDO (mumbling mechanically to himself, invoking

Schopenhauer)

Go away, guys; go away, dog; go, go...

Little by little, the three soldiers move away, the dog’s master pulling the animal behind him.
Guido breathes a sigh of relief.

GUIDO (smiling)
Good for you, Ferruccio—it works!

He runs off into the darkness, wrapping Joshua’s jacket around his head.

SCENE 73

THE CAMP—EXT., NIGHT

The women are climbing up onto a truck. In the background white smoke and flames, rising from
a tall smokestack, are blown through the camp by the high wind. Guido’s face appears from
behind a comer. He is wearing Joshua’s jacket on his head like a woman’s kerchief. He retreats

suddenly because the searchlight is approaching the street. When it passes, Guido comes out,
takes a few steps, and quickly climbs up onto a windowsill. He grabs an iron drainpipe against
112

the wall. The searchlight roves under his feet. He jumps down and sneaks up, in the dark, to the
women standing in line.

He moves among the women, looking at their faces.

GUIDO
Dora? Anyone by the name of Dora here? Dora?

He moves among the women.
SCENE 74
THE CAMP; THE WOMEN’S BARRACKS—INT., NIGHT

Guido appears in the open door. The women’s barracks are empty, barely lit by the lights outside
filtering through the windows.

GUIDO
Dora? Dora, are you here? It’s me, it’s Guido! 1 know someone’s
hiding here, is there anyone by the name of Dora?

A moment later.

A WOMAN’S VOICE
No!

Guido leaves.
SCENE 75
THE CAMP—EXT., NIGHT
A truck filled with women is backing up into a street where the wind is blowing clouds of
smoke.The women in the truck see Guido’s face appear among those of the women standing on
the ground.
GUIDO
Anyone by the name of Dora here? She's Italian—it’s my wife!
Dora?
A WOMAN

Yes, there’s a Dora. (she calls)
Dora!

GUIDO (excitedly)
Dora, it’s me!

He starts following the truck, which is picking up speed.

 
113

SECOND WOMAN
Who's there?

It is another Dora, a pale girl with short, light hair and blue eyes.

GUIDO
No, that’s not her, is there another Dora?

The truck goes fast; Guido is running behind it.

GUIDO
As soon as you’re out the gates, jump off the truck!

But they don’t hear him, the truck is already far away. Guido is alone, heedless of how exposed
he is. In fact, a WOMAN SOLDIER sees him and blows her whistle.

WOMAN SOLDIER (in German)
Over there! That woman!

Guido, realizing what has happened, runs off. The searchlight follows him. The light stops at the
wall Guido climbed before. The searchlight passes the window; something is hanging from the
window. The light moves back and focuses on a waving blanket hanging from the window. The
light widens and creeps up the wall. Guido is hanging from the drainpipe, blinded by the light.
The blanket has slipped to his feet. Footsteps are heard approaching. Guido lets go and falls to
the ground, but he can’t run because the blanket is around his ankles. He picks it up and ties it
around his waist as best he can under the murderous eyes of a German SOLDIER who is nearing
him, machine gun in hand. The soldier pokes under the blanket with the gun muzzle; the blanket
moves, and he sees Guido’s rolled up trousers and male legs. He takes a step back, and aims the
machine gun. Guido closes his eyes and hunches over, but a voice stops the action.

A SERGEANT (in German)
Stop! What are you doing? Not here, take him to the usual place.

SOLDIER (in German)
Yes, sir!

The soldier points the gun barrel at Guido, motioning him to go first. The soldier follows. They
move off toward the women’s area, near the yard.

SCENE 76

THE CAMP; NEAR THE OFFICERS’ MESS—EXT., DAWN

Scattered gunfire is heard here and there in the camp. A few jeeps with officers aboard leave the
camp at top speed through the main gate. Guido, dressed like a woman, is walking ahead of the

armed soldier. He knows there is no escape, and looks around him for a last-minute solution. A
motorcycle goes by. Guido starts. The soldier says,

 
114

SOLDIER (loudly, in German)
Straight ahead, move it!

They go a few more steps. Guido is stil] looking around, but he realizes that they are about a
dozen meters from the box where Joshua is hiding. He can’t risk it, he slows down and looks
toward the child. Joshua’s eyes light up in the dark box, behind the slot. He sees...Guido, in
comical woman’s dress, who winks and smiles at him. Then Guido makes a funny face and starts
goose-stepping—the military high jinks Joshua knows so.well. Still hidden in the box, the little
boy stifles a laugh. The soldier gets nervous, he doesn’t understand the kidding around.

SOLDIER (in German)
What the devil are you doing! Speed it up—tum right here.

There is a building on the right. The two disappear around a corner. Two rapid bursts of gunfire
are heard. A moment later the soldier appears, walking quickly as he shoulders his weapon. In
the meantime, the sun has appeared on the horizon. The wind is still blowing. A truck

hes, but this time it is filled with German soldiers. It slows down. Two of the soldiers
jump onto the truck, throwing their machine guns behind them. The truck leaves the yard,
followed by two motorcycles and an army car. The sun has risen even higher. The wind begins to
die down. The last hundred or so prisoners straggle out of the camp’s main gate. They are the
weakest. They help one another. And when the last prisoner has left the camp, the camera moves
x where Joshua is hidden. A few moments of silence. Ever so slowly, the door of the box
opens. Joshua comes out and takes a step or two, looking around with a half-smile. There is not a
soul in sight, not even a fly. Suddenly, from not too far off, a noise breaks the silence, the
deafening noise of an engine, a brand- /new sound that gets nearer and nearer and louder and
louder. Joshua stares straight ahead. The noise is deafening by now. Then, on a street between
two buildings, an enormous green tank appears. It bears the white American star. The creature
moves forward, raising dust and heading straight for Joshua. The treads stop a few steps from the
little boy...who is standing still as a statue, his mouth wide open. He can’t believe his eyes. He
smiles. All around, the air fills with the sounds of other American Army vehicles, jeeps, and
motorcycles. A few words of English can be heard. The tower of the tank opens and a young

ICAN SOLDIER appears. He sees the little boy and smiles. He looks around the deserted

camp, then focuses his eyes on Joshua again.

 
 

AMERICAN SOLDIER (in English)
Hi, boy!

Joshua stares at the gigantic tank, which is moving. He takes a step forward.

JOSHUA
It’s true!

He’s crazed with joy. Behind him, American soldiers are coming and going, weapons in hand.
AMERICAN SOLDIER (in English)

You alone, kid? What’s your name? Can you understand me?
‘We'll give you a ride, come on up! ~
cel.

115

Without thinking twice, Joshua climbs up happily.
SCENE 77
THE COUNTRY SIDE—EXT., DAY.

Broad fields, all in blossom, slope down sweetly toward the heavily trodden dirt road at the foot
of the hills. The camp survivors are walking toward the road, following others who are walking
in the distance. They are scattered, an odd group, walking unsteadily, too exhausted to celebrate.
American Army officers and enlisted men in vehicles—motorcycles, jeeps—make their way
through the prisoners crowding the road. The view from the tower of the tank, moving along
slowly, is panoramic. Next to the tank’s tower, alongside the American soldier, is Joshua, all
excited, enthralled. He is putting a last piece of chocolate into his mouth. The tank passes by the
prisoners, many of whom stop now and then to sit in the grass by the roadside and catch their
breath, Suddenly, the little boy turns: The tank has just passed someone he knows.

JOSHUA (yelling)
Mommy!

“The tank stops. The child jumps down and races back up the bill as fast as he can.

JOSHUA (yelling)
Mommy!

Runaing. he throws himself at his mother, who is sitting on the grass near a cherry tree. She falls
backward, Joshua on top of her, kissing her.

DORA
Joshua!

VOICE OVER (adult Joshua)
This is my story. This is the sacrifice my father made. This was
his gift to me.

She looks and looks at him, paralyzed by joy.
|

JOSHUA
We won!
DORA
Yes, we won!
JOSHUA

 

A thousand points! Couldn’t you just die laughing? We came in
first! We get to take the tank home! We won! ~
co git,

She igcalina him ap idh-hes-enees: she lifts him up in her arms. And he laughs.
