INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - MORNING

We open with QUICK DETAIL SHOTS of a young boy dressin

 

- A brown shirt buttoned.
- Badges pinned.
- Belt tightened.
- Neck kerchief tied.
= Socks pulled up.
- Hair combed.
Shoes clicked together at the heels, one foot stomps down
hard on the floor.

He is dressed. We PULL to a CLOSE-UP, coming face to face
with our HERO

 

JOHANNES BETZLER, (JOJO), a cute 10 year-old boy.

The room is covered with NAZI POSTERS and other
PARAPHERNALIA, including pictures of ADOLF HITLER. You
guessed it, he’s a little Nazi.

Jojo stares into a full-length mirror and takes a deep
breath.

gogo
Jojo Betzler. Ten years old. And today
you join the ranks of the Jungvolk in a
very special training weekend. It’s going
to be intense. But today you become a
man.

(deep breath, nervous)
I swear to devote all my energies and my
strength to the savior of our country,
Adolf Hitler. I am willing and ready to
give up my life for him, so help me God.

A STRANGE FIGURE passes behind him, an ADULT, dressed in a
NAZI UNIFORM. It feels ghostly and fantastical. We'll find
out who this guy is very soon.

VOICE (0.S.)
Yeah man, that’s right.

(beat)
Now, Jojo Betzler, what is your mind?

gogo
A snake mind.

VOICE (0.S.)
And Jojo Betzler, what is your body?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

gogo
A wolf body.

VOICE (0.S.)
And Jojo Betzler, what is your courage?

JOIO
Panther courage.

VOICE (0.S.)
And Jojo Betzler, what is your soul?

JOJO
A German soul.

VOICE (0.8.)
Yeah man, you're ready.

gogo
Adolf, I don’t think I can do this.

The stranger leans into shot, revealing it’s none other than
Jojo's IMAGINARY FRIEND, ADOLF HITLER. However, it’s not the
Hitler we're all used to, he’s imaginary and therefore can
only know what Jojo knows. He’s more of a charming buffoon
who floats through life with carefree, whimsical abandon.

ADOLF

What?! Of course you can. Sure you're a
bit scrawny, unpopular, and still can’t
tie your shoelaces without adult
supervision, but you're also the bestest,
most loyal little Nazi I've ever met. Not
to mention you're incredibly handsome.

 

Jojo smiles. Feeling better.

ADOLF (CONT'D)
Now you're gonna go out there and have a
great time, ok?

JOIO
Ok.

ADOLF
Ok, that’s the spirit! Now, Heil me man.

gogo
Heil Hitler.

ADOLF

Come on, you can do better than that.
Heil Hitler!

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

Jogo
Heil Hitler!

ADOLF
Just throw it away. Don’t even think
about it.

Jogo
Heil Hitler!

ADOLF
No, you're over thinking it. Heil Hitler.

Jogo
Heil Hitler!

ADOLF
Heil HITLER.

They start jogging on the spot.

gogo
Heil HITLER!

ADOLF
Ooh, that’s it.

gogo
HEIL HITLER!

 

ADOLF
Yay, now you've got it!

Jogo
Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Heil Hitle:
Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler! Heil Hitle

 

ADOLF
Ooh, have a great day! You're going to be
the best. You can do it!

Jojo and Adolf scream like war pigs and Jojo sprints out the
door.

JOJO / ADOLF
HEIL HITLER! HEIL HITLER! HEIL HITLER
HEIL HITLER! HEIL HITLERRRRRER! !!

MUSIC CUE: ‘KOMM GIB MIR DEINE HAND’ BY THE BEATLES
OPENING TITLES: INTERCUT SHOTS OF JOJO RUNNING THROUGH HIS
HOMETOWN WITH FOOTAGE OF HITLER’S RISE TO GOD STATUS -
SCREAMING FANS, FANATICAL SUPPORTERS, PEOPLE CRYING, WOMEN
FAINTING - BASICALLY ESTABLISHING THAT HE WAS THE BEATLES OF
1930'S GERMANY.

EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY
Jojo skips happily down the street, Heil Hitlering various

locals he passes by. He meets his best friend, YORKI, 10
chubby, gawky, clumsy, who waits for him in a doorway.

Jogo
Heil Hitler, Yorki!
YORKI
Heil Hitler, Jojo!
gogo
Are you ready for the best weekend ever?
YORKI
Yes I am!
Jogo
Let’s go!

They run off together, continuing to Heil Hitler everyone
they meet.

EXT. WOODS - HITLERJUGEND CAMP - DAY

Jojo and Yorki sit with a large group of other young kids,
all dressed in Hitler Youth uniforms, in a sprawling field

CAPTAIN KLENZENDORF, weathered, disillusioned, addresses the
crowd of kids. He has a DEAD-EYE and is accompanied by the
awkwardly enthusiastic SUB-OFFICER FINKEL, and a brutish
female instructor, FRAULEIN RAHM.

KLENZENDORF
Heil Hitler, guys.

FINKEL / FRAULEIN RAHM
Heil Hitler!

KIDS
Heil Hitler!

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

KLENZENDORF
Jungvolk, welcome to the Hitlerjugend
training weekend in which we will make
men and women of you all. My name is
Captain Klenzendorf - you may call me
Captain K.

FINKEL
Captain K! Woo!

KLENZENDORF
-and this is Sub-Officer Finkel. And
Fraulein Rahm.

(beat)
So, a little about me. Who am I and why
am I here talking to a bunch of little
titty-grabbers instead of leading my men
into battle towards glorious death? Great
question. I’ve asked it myself every day
since Operation Screw-Up, where I lost a
perfectly good eye in a totally
preventable enemy attack. And according
to my superiors, you need two eyes to be
a meaningful part of the war effort.

 

Beat. He picks up a rifle and quickly fires a shot, hitting a
target 100 yards away. The kids applaud.

KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)

Over the next two days you little
critters will get to experience some of
the things that the mighty German Army
goes through every day. And even though
it would appear our country’s on the back
foot and that there really isn’t much
hope us of winning this war, apparently
we're doing just fine.

(takes a breath, composes

himself, he’s sad)
Anyway. You boys have all been issued
with your Deutsches Jungvolk Daggers.

Jojo and Yorki inspect and admire their nice new DEUTSCHES
JUNGVOLK (DJ) KNIVES.

KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
These are very special and expensive
weapons, you should never be without
them. And don’t try to stab each other.

FINKEL
No stabbing!

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: (2)

KLENZENDORF
This is your first step towards being
men. Today you boys will be involved in
such activities as marching, bayonet
drills, grenade throwing, trench digging,
map reading, gas defense, camouflage,
trap setting, ambush techniques, war
games, firing guns and blowing stuff up.

Huge cheers from the group of boys. Jojo and Yorki smile at
each other, this is going to be awesome.

KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
The girls will practice important womanly
duties such as dressing wounds, making
beds, and learning how to get pregnant.

Groans of disappointment from the girls. Klenzendorf holds

the bridge of his nose as if preparing for the impending

headache he’s about to endure over the weekend. He sighs.

KLENZENDORF (CONT'D)
Alright, let’s get to it.

The crowd of kids salute and start screaming in excitement.
The older boys start yelling at smaller kids, rounding them
up and y'know, being Nazis. Finkel and Rahm lead them off.

FINKEL
On your feet you little Nazis! Let’s go!

FRAULEIN RAHM
Move, move, move!

More screaming from the kids.
KLENZENDORF
God help me.
MONTAGE - HITLER YOUTH TRAINING CAMP...
MUSIC CUE: ‘I DON’T WANT TO GROW UP’ BY TOM WAITS

various scenes of Jojo and Yorki training with the
Hitlerjugend.

- A bunch of kids try and climb over obstacles and under
nets. It’s mayhem.

- KNIFE THROWING. Jojo and Yorki stand around in a group of
boys throwing their DJ knives from 10 FEET into a tree.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

None of the knives stick, instead they fly off at dangerous
angles, one ricochets, lodging itself in another kid’s thigh.

- GUN RANGE. Jojo and some other kids aim their KARABINER 98K
RIFLES at a target in the distance. Jojo fires and, jumping
from the loudness of the shot, drops the rifle.

- WAR GAME. The boys are separated into 2 groups, one side
wearing RED SASHES and the other GREEN. They chase each other
round a clearing, pushing each other over and taking
prisoners etc. Jojo and Yorki are taken prisoner instantly.
An older lad, CHRISTOPH, looks at them with disappointment.

INT. HITLER YOUTH CAMP - TENT - AFTERNOON

Jojo sits in a group of boys and girls. One by one, sometimes
overlapping, the children call out.

CHILDREN
Horns / Serpent tongue / Fangs /
Green blood / Claws.

Their teacher, FRAULEIN RAHM, proudly writes the children’s
words, along with others, on a blackboard. Above them is the
heading: THE JEW. Finkel stands nearby, observing and taking
notes.

FRAULEIN RAHM
Fantastisch! Excellent work children. You
also forgot that the Jew is the offspring
of Satan and sucks the blood of Christian
children for their mitzvah.

Gasps from the children. Finkel nods - I'm afraid so.

FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT’D)
It has been scientifically proven that we
Aryans are 1000 times more advanced and
civilised than any other race.

Gasps and applause from the children. Fraulein Rahm smiles.
FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT’D)
Now, get your things together kids, it’s
time to burn some books!

CHILDREN
Yayyyy!!!
EXT. HITLER YOUTH CAMP - DUSK

A LARGE BONFIRE burns. The children hold stacks of books.
Jojo opens his bag and pulls out a small pile.

YORKI
Is that it? Only 4 books?

gogo

It’s all I could find on the list.
(reading the authors)

Kafka... Brecht... Hesse

losers.

 

Burn you

 

He throws them into the fire, Yorki follows suit. The books
land among other burning authors, FREUD, MANN, PROUST
HEMINGWAY, REMARQUE.

The children skip and dance round the bonfire, throwing books
into the inferno while Fraulein Rahm cackles maniacally.

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT

An encampment. Tents glow under the night sky

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Jojo and Yorki lie awake in sleeping bags, inspecting their
new DJ KNIVES.

gogo
Imagine being in a battle, you've just
run out of ammo, all you have is your DJ
Knife. I would take down 20 of them
before they got me. And I’d be laughing
when they did.

YORKI
I don’t like that situation. I don’t want
to die at all.

Jogo
Live Faithfully, Fight Bravely, and Die
Laughing, Yorki, that’s the motto.

YORKI

I know but I wouldn’t be laughing. I'd
probably be screaming.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

gogo
Then I’m afraid you might not be cut out
for Hitler’s personal guard. It’s really
hard to get chosen y'know. You need to
have perfect vision, perfect teeth and
you're only allowed a little bit of fat.

YORKI
(prodding his chubbiness)
Jews sound scary, huh?

gogo
Not to me. If I met one I’d kill it like
that.

(tries to snap his fingers)
that.

 

Like

 

YORKI
But how would you know if you saw one?
They can look just like us.

JosO
Oh I'd know. I’d feel it’s head for
horns. And they smell like Brussels
Sprouts.

YORKI
Oh yeah, I forgot about the Brussels
Sprouts bit.

gogo
Imagine catching one and giving it to
Hitler. That’d be a sure-fire way to get
into his personal guard.

YORKI
He'd be so impressed.

gogo
Then we would become best friends.

YORKI
I thought I was your best friend

gogo
Yorki, you're my second best friend.
First place is reserved for the Fihrer.
He, and only he can have that spot, so
unless you’re Hitler hiding in a fat
little boy’s body I'd be happy with 2nd
place.

(CONTINUED)
10.
CONTINUED: (2)

YORKI
I’m just a kid in a fat kid’s body.

gogo
Case closed.

Jojo rolls over and stares at the sky.

JOJO (CONT’D)
(whispering)

Night papa, I hope you come home soon.

Night Inga, I hope you're happy up there

EXT. WOODS - TRAINING GROUND - MORNING

Jojo sits with a bunch of other kids. Two team leaders,
CHRISTOPH and HANS, (21) smoke cigarettes and hold court.
Christoph kisses a girl before turning to the kids.

CHRISTOPH
When you stand before the enemy and have
to end his life, which of you will have
the stomach for it?

Everyone raises their hands. Jojo too, although a little
slow.

CHRISTOPH (CONT'D)
There is no room in Hitler's army for
those who lack strength. We want hardened
warriors who are prepared to kill at
will. Can you do that?

OTHER KIDS
Yes / Sure / Oh absolutely

CHRISTOPH
Johannes? Can you kill?

gogo
Pf£f, of course. I love killing.

CHRISTOPH
Good...

Hans uncovers a small cage nearby - it is filled with little
rabbits. Hans takes a bunny from the cage and holds it out
towards Jojo.

CHRISTOPH (CONT'D)
Kill it.

(CONTINUED)
ll.
CONTINUED:

Jogo
Hmm?

CHRISTOPH
Wring its neck. Kill the rabbit

gogo
Oh, I’m ok. I might do it later.

CHRISTOPH
No later, NOW. Or are you scared?

 

gogo
I’m not scared. I'm just allergic to fur
and I don’t want itchy hands all weekend.

Hans shoves the rabbit into Jojo's hands.

HANS
Place both hands around its neck and then
one hard twist. He might scream but we'll
just use the boot to finish it off.
Rill... kill...

Jojo, shaking now, holds the bunny and looks at it directly
in the eye. He gulps. The boys join the chant

OTHER KIDS
Kill, Kill, Kill, Kill...

The boys are like baying wolves; they crouch in around Jojo
as he leans over the rabbit.

Jojo DROPS the bunny, trying to shoo it away. But it doesn’t
run and Hans steps forward, grabs the rabbit, and snaps its
neck. Shocked gasps and squeaks of horror from the kids. One
of them faints. Probably Yorki.

CHRISTOPH
Coward. Just like your father.

JOIO
He's not a coward, he’s in Italy.

CHRISTOPH
No one has heard from him in two years.
He's a deserting coward just like you.

HANS
Yeah, he’s a deserter.

JOIO
No, he doesn’t do that, he fights.

(CONTINUED )
12.
CONTINUED: (2)

HANS
He’s scared and so are you. You're as
scared as a rabbit.

He kicks Jojo to the ground. Hans places a boot on his neck.

CHRISTOPH
Scared little rabbit. Maybe we should
snap your neck too.

The rest of the kids taunt Jojo. He stands and runs into the
woods, trying to escape the laughter. Hans encourages them to
chant “Jojo Rabbit” as he runs.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Jojo sits alone on a log, sobbing to himself. He looks up to
see a little BUTTERFLY flitting around by his feet... and
then a voice comes from behind.

 

VOICE (0.S.)
Poor Jojo, what’s wrong, little man’

Jojo turns around, it’s Adolf

gogo
Hi Adolf.

Adolf takes a seat.

ADOLF
Why so down in the dumps? A strong boy
like yourself shouldn't be sad, you
should be happy like a cloud! Clouds
don’t care about anything!

gogo
They called me a coward. And my papa,
they say he makes desserts instead of
fighting. But I know he’s still fighting
for you, for me, and for Germany.

ADOLF
Oh, of course he is! And he is also
making nice desserts, nothing wrong with
that. My God, his custard tarts are the
only thing keeping up morale at the
front.

(beat)
Want to tell me about the rabbit
incident? What was that all about?

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

13.

gogo
They wanted me to kill it. I’m sorry.

ADOLF
Meh, don’t worry about it. I couldn't
care less. Just like a cloud.

Jogo
But now they call me a scared rabbit.

ADOLF
Well you want to know something?

(Off Jojo's nod)
Just because they’re small and
delightfully cute doesn’t mean rabbits
are cowards. The rabbit faces a dangerous
world everyday, hunting carrots for his
family... for his country. Forget those
boys. They have their place and so do
you. My empire will be made up of all
animals, eagles, lions, elephants and
even the mighty rabbit.

Hitler offers Jojo a cigarette.

gogo
No thanks, I don't sm-~

ADOLF
Can I give you some really good advice?
Be the rabbit. The humble bunny can
outwit all his enemies and that is why he
is a hero. Be. The. Rabbit.

He winks at Jojo who tries to wink back but still can only
manage a weird double wink-blink. Adolf wanders off.

Just then,

Yorki arrives.

YORKI
Jojo! Are you alright Jojo? Who were you
talking to?

Jogo
Nobody, I was just out here doing some
push-ups for my muscles.

YORKI
Oh, I thought you were crying.

gogo
Are you a teardrop specialist?

(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED: (2)

YORKI
No.

gogo
Case closed. Now, Yorki Dorky, it’s time
for Jojo to show these pip-squeaks who is
the real cowardly rabbit.

He takes a deep breath and scurries off into the bushes.

YORKI
I’m sorry what are you talking about?

Jogo
Never mind.

YORKI
Jojo, where are you going?

gogo
To be the rabbit!

EXT. WOODS - TRAINING GROUND - DAY

Captain Klenzendorf sits in a deck chair. He pulls the pin on
a HAND-GRENADE and hurls it into an open space. It EXPLODES.

REVEAL he is holding a lesson on hand-grenades. Hans,
Christoph, and the rest of the boys watch from the safety of
a TRENCH.

KLENZENDORF
Now lads, each of you will be given the
opportunity to ignite and throw a
grenade. I will personally be supervising
each of you to make sure you don’t blow
your eyes out or something. Now, who's
first? Klaus. Come on lad.

A boy steps up and holds out his hand to take a grenade. As
Klenzendorf goes to hand it to him there’s a sudden flurry as
Jojo bursts out of the bushes and onto the scene.

Jogo
Jojo rabbit! Jojo rabbit! Hunting
carrots, Jojo rabbit!

He jumps across the trench and, snatching the grenade from

Klenzendorf’s hand, continues into the clearing beyond.
Suddenly Adolf appears, running next to Jojo.

(CONTINUED)
1s.
CONTINUED:

ADOLF
This is amazing! We're like two human
antelopes!
Jojo pulls the PIN on the grenade and screams an ungodly war-
cry as he hurls it into the air. It bounces off a tree then
ricochets backwards, landing at his feet.

Jogo
Scheisse.

ADOLF
Shiiiiiit.

BOOM. Jojo is blown up.

KLENZENDORF
Don't do that.

cur TO:

EXT. WOODS - JOJO’S POV

JoJo's POV - Jojo is being carried on a stretcher through the
woods. Klenzendorf’s face leans in to shot.

KLENZENDORF
(lying BADLY)

Don’t worry kid, you're doing fine. You

look great.

Yorki leans in, his eyes go wide, he faints.
Adolf leans in. Gives Jojo the THUMBS UP. But he looks
worried and disgusted. He also faints.
INT. AMBULANCE
Now we're in an ambulance.
Fraulein Rahm leans in, her face contorts in disgust.
FRAULEIN RAHM
Oh God, he looks like a Picasso painting.
(beat)
Cubist period.
INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - DAY

Jojo's stretcher is being wheeled down a corridor.
16.

INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY
Bright lights. The doctor hovers over us, we see INSTRUMENTS.
Klenzendorf steps into shot, addresses the DOCTOR.

KLENZENDORF
His mother’s going to kill me.

Adolf leans in, smiles and gives us the thumbs up. Jojo’s
BLOODIED THUMB comes into view.

FADE OUT.

INT. HOSPITAL - WARD - DAY

= A woman’s face comes in to focus. This is Jojo’s mother,
ROSIE BETZLER. As she reaches the bed, she stops, puts her
hand over her mouth. Her eyes well with tears.

ROSIE
Jojo... my darling cub.

= Jojo’s hand raises into shot, reaching out to her. The shot
floods with tears, de-focuses, and fades.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - BEDROOM ~ MORNING

A NEW JOJO stands before us in front of the mirror. He has
scars on one side of his face, his RIGHT ARM appears stiff,
and he now has a limp.

ROSIE (0.S.)
Hey kid.

In the mirror Jojo sees his mother standing at the door,
smiling. She hugs him tightly, making growling noises.

ROSIE (CONT'D)
My darling little cub.

gogo
Why so happy? Your son is ugly like a
monster.

ROSIE

You're no monster. You're still my
beautiful Jojo.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:

ROSIE (CONT'D)

Besides the doctors are confident those
scars will heal and you'll get most of
the movement back in your leg. But I’m
just happy to have you back home.

Jogo
I'll never be in Hitler’s SS Guard now.

ROSIE
You're fine as you are.

gogo
I need to be better.

ROSIE
You need to be you. Mama Lion worries
about her cub, that’s all. Especially
when papa Lion isn’t here.

oso
Or Inga.

ROSIE
Or Inga.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - LOUNGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jojo tries to tie his bootlaces but has trouble with only one

good hand. Rosie kneels down and helps him.

ROSIE
A few more months and you'll get it. You
grab the rabbit by the tail, wrap it
around his ear, tie it all up and then
stuff him back (on) down the hole.

(then)
Now, we better get on our way. Getting
out of the house will do wonders for your
recuperation.

Rosie helps Jojo into his jacket. He catches another glimpse

of himself in a mirror.

gogo
I don’t want to go out there.

ROSIE
Don’t be silly, of course you do:

gogo
I look stupid. People will stare.

(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:

ROSIE
Let them! Enjoy the attention, kid. Not
everyone is lucky enough to look stupid.
What I wouldn’t give.

She looks in the mirror.

ROSIE (CONT’D)
Instead I am cursed to look incredibly...
attractive...

Entranced, she moves in, almost kissing her reflection.

ROSIE (CONT’D)
Now, you're going to pluck up your
courage, walk out that door and have a
fantastic adventure. Okay?

gogo
(nodding, unsure)
Okay.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER
Rosie parts the blinds on the front door and peeks outside.

ROSIE
Field Marshall Jojo, looks like the coast
is clear. Now...

Looking over her shoulder, she produces a large, plain
biscuit. It’s all covert and over the top, but fun for Jojo.

ROSIE (CONT’D)
-many good men died to bring you this.
It’s a special potato-flour biscuit for
emergencies. Emergencies dammit! Not only
is it a biscuit, but it also doubles as
an eye-patch in case you are invited to a
pirate party. It could pass for a shield,
an earring, a spare wheel, and even a
believable discus should you find
yourself participating in a biscuit
Olympiad. And in a pinch it also acts as
a type of food to sustain you until
dinner.

(then, peeking out the door

once more)
Field Marshall Jojo, you're our top man.
Prepare to leave the house...

 

Jojo smiles and prepares himself, playing along.

(CONTINUED)
1g.
CONTINUED:

gogo
Is it dangerous?

Rosie smiles and winks.

ROSIE
Extremely

 

EXT. HITLER YOUTH OFFICE - DAY

Jojo and Rosie enter the HITLER YOUTH OFFICE.

INT. HITLER YOUTH OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

A giant room. Nazi Propaganda adorns the office and large
SWASTIKA BANNERS hang on the walls. The woman from the HJ
Camp, FRAULEIN RAHM, sits at a desk, staring intensely at a
large framed photo of HITLER on the wall.

A couple of TEENAGE YOUTH OFFICERS loiter about practicing
stabbing things with their DJ Knives while some BDM GIRLS
operate a PRINTING PRESS which spits out pages of PROPAGANDA.

FINKEL is off to the side listening to music through
HEADPHONES and dancing like Ian Curtis from Joy Division,

ROSIE
HEIL HITLER! !

Fraulein Rahm jumps.

FRAULEIN RAEM
Jesus.

Captain Klenzendorf emerges from his office.

KLENZENDORF

Jojo Betzler! Looking good, friend!
(beat, to Rosie)

Frau Betzler.

Rosie walks up to Klenzendorf and kicks him in the balls. He
drops to the ground.

KLENZENDORF (CONT‘D)
Owwww

ROSIE
Ok, that’s that. Because of you, my kid
has lost the feeling in his arm and can’t
walk properly and has a messed up face.

(CONTINUED)
20.
CONTINUED:

KLENZENDORF
But he stole the hand-grenade!

ROSIE
Yeah yeah. Now you're going to take care
of him while I go to work. You'll give
him a job and make sure he feels
included. Got it?

KLENZENDORF
Got it. I really got it.
ROSIE
Good.
KLENZENDORF
(standing)

Wow. Ok let’s start this again. Everyone,
this is Johannes Betzler. Remember he
stole a hand-grenade and blew himself up
and as a result I got kicked in the nuts
by his mother.

ROSIE
You sure did.

KLENZENDORF
I also got demoted if that makes you feel
better.

ROSIE
It does.

KLENZENDORF

So, Jojo. Great to see you. Alive. I'm
sure we can figure out something for you
to do

(beat)
Ideas guys? Come on!

FRAULEIN RAHM
Well, we need someone to walk the clones.
They haven't been outside in weeks and
some of them are malfunctioning.

REVEAL: In the corner of the room we see about a DOZEN 8 YEAR
OLD CLONES, doing various chores, typing, sweeping, painting,
playing chess. Some are just standing there dribbling

FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT’D)
Also, you could hand out some of this
propaganda and deliver these
conscriptions.

(CONTINUED)
ai.
CONTINUED: (2)

gogo
I don’t suppose I could be conscripted
could 1?
ROSIE
(shaking her head
throughout )

Great idea! I give you full permission to
send this ten year old child off to war
Someone give this guy a gun!

gogo
Actually mother I’m feeling quite fit and
would be more than happy to fight at the
front.

KLENZENDORF
Get in line kid. Besides, you’re still on
the mend. For now you can start small.
Conscripts and propaganda.

gogo
As you wish. I will execute my orders
with precision and strength, like a
precise... boulder.

Beat.

FRAULEIN RAHM
Just deliver the stuff , kid.

JOJO
Jawohl!

He turns on his heels and is OUT.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

Jojo pins up some posters of HITLER in a stoic pose, looking
off into the distance. Below him is the propaganda slogan:

ONE PEOPLE, ONE EMPIRE, ONE LEADER
Jojo turns and joins his mother who is staring at a make-
shift GALLOWS. FIVE BODIES, men and women hang from the cross—
beam

gogo
Yuck.

He tries to turn away but Rosie takes his head and turns it

EXT. STREET - DAY

Jojo pastes more propaganda and public announcements around
town, A truck drives past and we see one of the forest
bullies, HANS, on the back with a bunch of other young
soldiers.

HANS
Hey, Jojo Rabbit! Oh my God, look at your
face! Ewwww!

Look at me, I ama soldier now and you

Jojo arrives home.

Mama! I'm home.

He drops his satchel and heads for the kitchen.

JOJO (CONT'D)
Mama, Field Marshall Jojo is home.

Suddenly, a noise from upstairs. A small THUD. Jojo looks up.

JOJO (CONT’D)
Mama Lion?

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - LATER

Jojo slowly makes his way down the upstairs hall, looking in
rooms. He moves towards his sister’s room. He takes a moment.
before stepping into the room and wandering around. He looks
at a photo of INGA, smiles and puts it back. Then...

Jojo notices something on the other side of the room. On the
ground sits a picture in a frame. He picks it up and then he
Sees: A THIN CUT IN THE WALLPAPER in the shape of a door.

Jojo takes his trusty DJ KNIFE and pries the door OPEN. As
Jojo's eyes adjust he begins making out objects. At first
it’s only BOOKS.

Jogo
The bad books. It’s not allowed.

Then he sees a candle, bedding, a plate, a fork, AND...

.+.a SKINNY, PALE CREATURE hunched in the corner, its face
partially hidden beneath her hair, dark eyes staring back.

Screaming with fright, Jojo drops his knife and stumbles back
out into the room.

Frozen in fear, Jojo stares into the darkness beyond the
secret door. Slowly, a pale hand wraps around the corner, and
then a skinny GIRL emerges. This is ELSA KORR (17)

ELSA
Hi

Jojo bolts as fast as he can, out the door and downstairs
where he trips and lands on the bottom landing.

ELSA (0.S.) (CONT’D)
Little boy...

STOMP. STOMP. STOMP. Footsteps on the stairs get louder.
Eventually Elsa rounds the corner halfway up the stairs.

Jogo
What do you want? Are you a ghost?

ELSA
(smiling spookily)
Sure. A ghost.

ELSA
Johannes, that’s no way to treat a ghost.

Jogo
Why do you live in the wall?!

ELSA
Where else should a ghost live?

Beat. Jojo leaps up and tries to make a run for it, but
before he can reach the door she grabs him by the scruff of
the neck and slams him into a wall.

ELSA (CONT’D)
Don’t make me run kid, I’m far too hungry
and you know how much we love the taste
of blood.

Jojo checks his sheath for his DJ KNIFE but it’s empty. Elsa
reveals the knife in her hand

ELSA (CONT’D)
Lose something?
(beat)
I'm not a ghost Johannes, I’m something
worse. But I think you already know that
don’t you? You know what I am.

No.

She presses the knife to his throat,

ELSA
Yes. Say it.

Of course. Go on then, tell them. But you
know what happens if you do? I'll say you
helped me. And your mother too. Then
we'll all be kaput. and if you tell her

you know about me... just one word...
(raising the knife to his
neck)

I’ll do the world a great big favour and
cut your Nazi head off. Got it?

She releases him and backs away, still holding the knife.

ELSA (CONT’D)
I think I‘11 hold onto this. It’s pretty.

She wanders back up the stairs leaving Jojo in shock.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jojo enters Inga/Elsa's room. He's wearing household objects
as ARMOUR; A POT sits on his head, he holds a KITCHEN KNIFE,
and he has a TRASH-CAN LID for a shield. He goes to the
CLOSED secret door and knocks twice.

KNOCK-KNOCK.

Adolf taps his watch. Jojo nods.

JOJO (CONT’D)
ok?

From behind, in his ear, where Adolf was just standing

 

ELSA
Not okay.

Jojo spins, she’s right behind him, holding his knife
smiling. She kicks him hard against his trash-can lid shield.
He flies back, hitting the wall and collapsing in a heap.
Elsa picks up the KITCHEN KNIFE, flips it in her hand.

Okay, let’s talk like turkeys. I guess

around that right now. But y’know,
there’s no reason this thing in the attic
needs to ruin your life. You could
actually use it to your advantage.

gogo
How?

ADOLF
Well, when someone tries to use mind-
powers on me, you know what I do? Use
mind powers back on them. Remember last
year when that one-armed pirate, Von
Stauffenberg, tried to blow me up with a
table bomb?

JOO
Yeah, you survived.

ADOLF
Correct-a-mundo. But the only reason I
survived, apart from having bomb-proof

Oh come on, ghosts?? We have rats in the

They continue this hopeless exchange a few more times. She
eventually keeps one of his eyes open with her finger and
“winks” his other eye for him.

There you go! You got it!

She kisses him good-night and turns out the light.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A match is struck and a candle lit. As our eyes adjust to the
flickering light we can make out Elsa sitting in the
darkness. We then follow the match to find Rosie. She
produces bread, some pickle and a slice of cheese. Elsa
begins gobbling it down.

Jojo emerges at the surface where we see other WOUNDED MEN -
amputees, burn victims, etc.

Adolf emerges from the pool and paddles around the wounded
soldiers, doing a very bad job of hiding his disgust.

Jojo looks over to see his mother talking to Klenzendorf by
the side of the pool.

Well, if it isn’t Herr Handgrenade
himself. How's the leg?

gogo
Pretty much healed. It only eighty
percent hurts. What are you guys doing
here?

KLENZENDORF
I’m also being made to teach the HJ boys
water warfare training. In case they ever
need to go to battle in a swimming pool.

can I ask you about Jews?

KLENZENDORF
Oh God, why?

Jogo
What should I do if I see one?

KLENZENDORF
If you see a Jew then we tell the Gestapo
and they tell the SS and then they go and
kill the Jew. And anyone who helped the
Jew. And, because these are very paranoid
times, probably some other people just in
case. It’s a pretty drawn out process.

Jojo gulps.

gogo
Even if the Jew hypnotised someone to
make them hide the Jew in the first
place?

KLENZENDORF
I'd be amazed if that could happen.

FRAULEIN RAHM
It can. It happened to my uncle. This Jew
hypnotised him into drunk fishing and he
drowned.

(to Jojo, suddenly probing)
Did you see one? A Jew?

gogo
Nope. I’m not sure I'd be able to tell if
I did.

KLENZENDORF

Me neither. Without their funny hats it’s
damn near impossible. Someone should
write a book on the subject. It’d make
everything a lot easier.

This sparks an idea in Jojo’s head.

A WHISTLE is heard and we cut to see a group of HITLER JUGEND
KIDS, fully dressed and wearing boots and BACKPACKS sit on
the side of the pool. They all JUMP IN and immediately start
sinking.

KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)

KNOCK-KNOCK.

The door opens and Elsa sits in the doorway. She still has
the two knives from earlier.

Ok, here’s the situation. If I tell on
you, you'll be in big trouble and I don’t
think you want that. But then you’ll tell
on me and my mother and we'll be in
trouble which I don’t want. And if you
tell my mother I know, then she'll kick
you out, which you don’t want. And if I
tell my mother I know, then you'll cut
off my head, which I also don’t want.

So it’s a Mexican stalemate.

ELSA
It’s just a normal stalemate.

Obviously. Everyone knows that.

Cheese, bread, meat. Those things will

probably leave them to it.

As he exits he winks at Jojo. Rosie winks at Jojo too.

Rosie holds her son close, squeezing him tightly, kissing
him, not letting go.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - MORNING
A PEN skids across the floor. Elsa stops it and picks it up
gogo
So, I'd like you to draw a picture of
where Jews live. A typical hive; where

you all sleep, eat, and where the Queen
Jew lays the eggs.

(CONTINUED)
45.
CONTINUED:

ELSA
You really are an idiot.

gogo
Come on. We have a lot of work to do.

Elsa takes his pen and paper and starts drawing

ELSA
Where Jews live. Ok.

Jogo
And tell me about your family.

ELSA
I'll tell you about Jews but you are not
privileged to know about my family.

Jogo
I need background.

ELSA
Let me ask you something. Why are you
hanging around with me? Don’t you have
any friends?

JOIO
Of course. Yorki.
ELSA
Yorki.
JOIO
Amongst others.
ELSA
Pit...
Jogo

You don’t have anyone.

ELSA
I have Nathan.

Jogo
Who the hell is that?

ELSA
My fiancée. I have him.

gogo
Where is he?

CONTINUED: (2)

ELSA
Fighting in the resistance.

She holds out a LOCKET with TWO PHOTOS inside. One is a
pretty picture of Elsa, the other of a handsome man, NATHAN.

ELSA (CONT'D)
He proposed to me on the banks of the
Fluss. He knelt down like a proper
gentleman, recited a poem by Rilke, and
when I said ‘yes’ we danced into the
night.

Jogo
Snore. Who's Rilke?

ELSA
A great Poet. Nathan’s favourite.

gogo
Oooh, Nathan's favourite, yayyy

ELSA
He's coming to rescue me and then we’1l
go live in Paris.

gogo
You would turn your back on Germany
forever.

ELSA

It turned on me first.

Jogo
Yeah well we don’t need you. You and your
stupid boyfriend can shut up and go live

in dumb... Cheese - Snail - Baguette -
Land.

ELSA
Now, now, just because you don’t have a
girlfriend.

Jogo

Pah! I'm too busy for girlfriends.

ELSA
One day you'll make time.

He rolls his eyes.

(CONTINUED)
a7.
CONTINUED: (3)

ELSA (CONT'D)
You'll think of nothing else. You'll meet
someone and spend your days dreaming of
the moment you can hold her in your arms
again. That’s love.

Jojo takes a moment, under her spell. He breaks out of it.

Jogo
Ridiculous.

ELSA
Finished.

Elsa places her finished drawing next to Jojo. It’s of him.
Underneath she has written the word DUMMKOPF.

gogo
I said to draw where Jews live. This is
just a stupid picture of my head.

She pushes her finger into his forehead.

ELSA
That’s where we live.

She slinks back into her hideout, closes the wall behind her.
Jojo stares at his drawing.

INT. TOWN - LIBRARY - DAY

Jojo walks down an aisle of the local library. He scans the
scant shelves and finds what he was looking for; RILKE: POEMS
AND ESSAYS. He pulls it out and secretly stuffs it into his
jacket. He turns around and sees Hitler stuffing his own
Jacket with about 20 books. They spill out onto the floor.

HITLER
Great thinking, Rabbit. We’ll use these
books to make a fake floor that she can
fall through, straight into a nest of
piranhas or hot lava. Or BOTH

(cackling sinisterly)
She won't know what hit her!

Oso
shh.

ADOLF
Shh? You shush. Let’s get a book and go
Libraries are dumb.
4g.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S ROOM - DAY

Jojo writes a letter at his desk, the Rilke poetry book lies
next to him. Hitler lays on the bed reading a book.

ADOLF
Yeah, this is a really good idea, what
we're doing right now. If she had a
heart, this would break it clean in two.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
Elsa sits in an armchair. Jojo walks in

gogo
I have something to tell you. I came
across an old letter from Nathan - your
fiancée — addressed to you. It’s quite
lucky I found it.

ELSA (0.S.)
What the hell are you talking about?

JOIO
A letter from Nathan. I'll read it.

Pause. Jojo reads his letter.

JOsO (CONT'D)
Dear Elsa, this is hard for me to say but
I don’t want to marry you anymore. I
found another woman and we laugh a lot
and do the tongue kiss. It’s like my
favourite poet Rilke says:

“We need, in love, to practice only this:
letting each other go.”

So goodbye and sorry about letting you
go. From Nathan, your ex-fiancée.

PS. I am not really in the resistance T
was lying. I am unemployed and quite fat
now.

Tears well in her eyes and she retreats into her hiding
space, upset. She closes the secret door, leaving Jojo alone

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

Jojo is back at his desk, writing another letter
49.

INT. JOJO'S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON
Jojo's back. He knocks lightly on Elsa’s wall.
KNOCK-KNOCK. The door remains closed.

Jogo
Hi. Um, don’t open the door but I
actually forgot there was a second
letter. I forgot I had it. I’1] just read
it.

(reading)
Dear Elsa. I just wanted to say that I
don’t want to break up with you now. I
changed my mind because I don’t want you
to kill yourself over me which a couple
of girls have done in the past and it’s
pretty stressful.

(beat)
I need you to stay alive. Thank God you
are being taken care of by that kid, who
I must say is a remarkable young man.
Beyond his years. And brave too.

(beat)
And let's still get married sometime -
even though I truly am unemployed and
have nothing much going for me. I don’t
even know how to tie a knot or read a
map. Yours, Nathan.

Beat. The door opens, revealing Elsa looking back.

CLOSE UP on Jojo, mid-discussion with Elsa.

JOJO

Moses and the king of them all, Jesus

She does a MAGEN DAVID POWER MOVE with her hands.

gogo
You're just saying any old name now. I've
never heard of these people and now I’m
fed up.

He goes to leave.

ELSA
Hey.

If you find any more of those letters,
will you let me know?

gogo
Sure. Ok.

Bye.
We stay with Elsa.
ELSA

Bye.

EXT. RIVER - DAY
Jojo and Rosie lie around on the banks of the river.
ROSIE

These banks used to be full of lovers.
There'd be singing, dancing, romance

JOJO
There’s no time for romance, we're at
war.

ROSIE

There’s always time for romance, babe
One day you’ll meet someone special.

gogo
Why does everyone keep telling me that?

ROSIE
Who else tells you?

Jogo
Everyone. Anyway, it’s a stupid idea

ROSIE
You're stupid. Love is the strongest
thing in the world.

gogo

I think you'll find that metal is the

strongest thing in the world, followed

closely by dynamite and then muscles.
(beat)

Besides, I wouldn’t even know it if I saw

it.

ROSIE
Surprise, surprise, your shoelaces are
undone. Again.

(she ties his laces)
You'll know it when it happens. You'll
feel it. A pain.

JOIO
In my arse I bet.

ROSIE
Nope, in your tummy. And your heart. Like
butterflies. It’s like you're full of
butterflies.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
gogo
Yuck.
ROSIE
Yeah, yuck. Come on Shitler, let’s get a
move on

She stands. Jojo gets to his feet but trips. His shoelaces
are tied together.

Jogo
Hey!

ROSIE
Haha! Oh kid, what’s wrong?

She helps him to his feet and pushes him along, he falls
again, laughing.

Jogo
Stop it!

ROSIE
Get it together, man. I’m worried about
you, are you drunk?

(to a passer-by)
Excuse me, can you help? My child is
drunk.

Jogo
(laughing)
Don't believe her!

ROSIE
“I'm Jojo and I shouldn't trust pretty
ladies to tie my shoelaces...”

He gets up and tries to chase her. They play like this, him
tripping over, trying to catch his mother, as locals watch

EXT. RIVER - LATER

His shoelaces now properly tied, Jojo and his mother walk
along the banks of the river. She walks next to Jojo but on
an elevated retaining wall so her feet are next to his head

ROSIE
You're growing up too fast. A ten year
old shouldn't be celebrating war or
talking politics. You should be having
fun, climbing trees, and then falling out
of those trees.

(CONTINUED)
53.
CONTINUED:

gogo
But the Fiihrer says that when we win, it
is us young boys who will rule the world.

ROSIE
Pah! The Reich is dying. We’re going to
lose this war and then what will you do?
All I'm saying is that life is a gift and
therefore we must celebrate it, hold on
to it. We have to dance to show God we
are grateful to be alive.

She does a small twirl next to him, her shoes spinning near
his head.

gogo
Well I won’t dance. Dancing’s for people
who don’t have a job.
ROSIE
Dancing’s for people who are free. It’s
escape from all of this.
gogo
Well then you're free to dance your way
home. I’1l ride!
He jumps on his bicycle and pedals away. She gives chase

ROSIE
Oh no you don’t! No one can stop me!

She jumps on her bike and pedals after him.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
Jojo and Rosie ride through the countryside.

A truck of wounded and battle weary soldiers pass by, their
young faces sunken and devoid of hope. Rosie waves.

ROSIE
Welcome back, boys! Now go home and kiss
your mothers!

This makes the boys smile and they wave back, cheering

No news from Nathan today I’m afraid.
He's probably doing something amazing
like reading a book or growing a beard.

Jojo sighs.

ELSA
What's wrong?

After a beat.

ELSA (CONT'D)

You want me to tell you about the Jews?
(Off his look)

Get comfortable.
(beat)

Okay, in the beginning we used to live in

caves, deep, deep in the centre of the
Earth.

JOIO
Wait.

Jojo takes a pen and starts writing in his book.

ELSA

Scary places full of strange and
wonderful creatures all with one thing in
common...

gogo
(nodding, knowingly)
Stealing the ends of penises.

ELSA
(laughing)
No you idiot. A love of art.

gogo
No cutting penises off?

ELSA
You want the story or not?

gogo

You may continue. But I know it’s true,
the penis thing. Rabbis use them for
earplugs.

She takes

ELSA
Aaaand moving on. So, after many years of
developing magic and spells, we slowly
moved out of the caves and into the
towns. Some of us stayed in the caves, in
our normal bodies.

gogo
Which are... blobs or something?

ELSA
Well, I'll draw them for you.

Jojo's book and starts drawing. Jojo watches her
nds as they create the picture. She hands the book
jo; it is a beautiful sketch of a WEIRD creature

that is more like an ELF or FAIRY. Definitely not Jewish or a

monster.

He writes

ELSA (CONT’D)
It would be better with colour.

Jogo
Where’s the horns?
ELSA
Um, they’re under the hair.
gogo
Where are yours?
ELSA
I'm too young. They grow when you turn
21.
gogo
Ahhh...

that down too.

ELSA
Anyway, these days we live among normal
humans but often we will take over a
house and hang from the ceiling when we
sleep, like bats. Oh, one interesting
thing is that we can read each other's

minds.
Jogo

Everyone's minds? What about German

minds?

ELSA
No, their heads are too thick for us to
penetrate. Like birds, our true language
sounds like singing. Crystals, glass and
gold.

Attracted to shiny things... but also

ugly things, Jews love ugliness. That's

another thing we learned in school.
(beat)

Ugly things yes? You love them?

Elsa regards this 10 year-old kid writing as fast as he can,
a manic look on his face. A small smile creeps across hers.

JOJO (CONT'D)
Hmm yes, ugly things.

He pauses, catches a glimpse of himself in a mirror on the
other side of the room. We see his scarred face. He registers
his “ugliness” and goes back to writing.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - JOJO’S BEDROOM - LATER

Jojo enters his room with a pep in his step. He sees Adolf
sitting in his bed.

ADOLF

You two seem to be getting on well.
gogo

No, I just... I was making sure she was

still alive.

ADOLF
What do you care?

gogo
I don’t, But I also don’t want a dead
person in my house. How would you like
it?

ADOLF.

I wouldn’t care. I’m tough. All the time

you guys are spending together... I have

to admit, it makes me uncomfortable.

Okay, sorry. You're right. Oh no, I've

made it weird between us, haven’t I? Is

it weird? Oh god, it’s weird now.

A beat as we process Adolf Hitler in Jojo’s bed. It’s weird.

gogo
I'm just tired. I’m going to bed.

ADOLF
sure, I was just keeping it warm for you.
Friends do that.

He gets out of bed, dressed in full regalia, including those
PUFFY-HIPPED PANTS that Generals wear.

ADOLF (CONT'D)
Hey do you think this uniform is
slimming? I’m not sure about the hips on
the pants.

gogo
You look great.

ADOLF,
Thank you. Now Jojo let me give you some
really good advice. Once you see what's
in her mind and where she's trying to get
you to go - in your own head, you must go
the other way. Don’t let her put you ina
brain prison! That, dear Jojo, is one
thing that cannot happen to a German! Do
not let her boss your German brain
around!

 

Jojo stares at him with admiration.

Jogo
I won't let my brain be bossed around by
her, mein Fihrer.

ADOLF
Try not to. It looks like you've got a
lot of good information in your book, so
I think it’s time to share it with the
world, yes?

Jojo nods.

Hitler goes to leave.

gogo
Um Adolf, do you think I’m... ugly?

ADOLF
Is that a trick question?

(he ponders, then)
Is there another word for ugly but not as
offensive?

gogo
I don’t think so.

ADOLF
Well if there was, that’d be you to a
tee. Anyway, ugly isn’t a bad thing.
Field Marshal Rommel was absolutely
hideous but he made up for it with great
joke telling abilities.

Jojo walks in to see FIVE MEN dressed in GERMAN MOUNTAIN GARB
- Lederhosen etc. One or two are holding CROOKS. Klenzendorf

is at his

desk, explaining something to Finkel.

KLENZENDORF
Finkel. I meant we'd need dogs for when

Hello. How can we help you today, Mr

Betzler? What’s up? Walk with me.

Jojo walks with Klenzendorf.

If someone turned in a Jew would they get
a medal or something?

KLENZENDORF
You still going on about those people?
You know we're preparing the city for
imminent invasion, right? I’m trying to
plan a defense strategy here. We've got
American's to the West, Russians to the
East.

FRAULEIN RAHM
My friend once met some Russians and they
ate him.

I’m really learning a lot about Jews. Did
you know they can read each others minds?
And when they sleep, they hang from the
ceiling like bats.

KLENZENDORF

And where did you come by this

information?
Jogo

Research. I’m writing a book.
KLENZENDORF

What‘s it called?
JOIO

“Yoohoo Jew”. It’s an exposé on Jews.

What about “Jews News”?

KLENZENDORF
Oh Jojo, you do have a wonderful
imagination!

gogo

But it’s real, not imagi--

KLENZENDORF
Oh, of course it’s real! When I was your
age I had a “friend” called Conny who
used to wet my bed when I was asleep. He
got me in so much trouble. Hey, you might
like to check out what I’m working on.

He holds up a sketch of a man wearing a tasseled uniform,
cape, and a helmet adorned with feathers. The drawings are in
coloured pencil, some of the pencils still lay about the desk
and as Klenzendorf talks, Jojo secretly pockets a couple.

KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
As part of our preparations for the
invasion I’m re-designing my uniform.
Note, the feathers for aerodynamics, the
sparkly colour to dazzle the enemy, the
boots are purely decorative.

(then)
And this is a Gatling gun mounted with a
radio which emits annoying music to
dishearten the enemy.

(suddenly covering the

picture with his hand)
This is all copyrighted by the way.

FINKEL
That means you can’t copy it.

KLENZENDORF
Don’t get any ideas kid. The kids tell me
that your father’s away fighting. So it
appears you are now the man of the house.
How's the going?

Klenzendorf chuckles.

EXT. TOWN - HOUSE - DAY
SFX: DOOR KNOCKING. A door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals a strange ROBOT CHARACTER made from
cardboard and silver paint, standing before her

Written in paint along its front we see:

HELFT UNS DEUTSCHLAND! (Help us Germany!)
WIR BRAUCHEN METALL! (We need Metal!)

A little door opens on the robot and we see Jojo's face
within.

gogo
Good morning Frau. Our brave troops and
wonderful Fiihrer need your help. I am
collecting much needed metal for the war
effort which will provide our troops with
bullets and airplanes. And guns, tanks,
ships, U-boats, bombs. And Iron Crosses.

OLD WOMAN
What?

Do you have anything metal? Nuts, bolts
pans, toothpaste tubes...

She stares at him a while.

OLD WOMAN
What?

EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY

Jojo wanders past torn propaganda posters of Hitler. In his
barrow are various items; a piece of RUSTED STEEL, a LEAD
PIPE, a few NUTS & BOLTS. Jojo chants as he moves through the

Hidden from sight within his Robot costume, he watches as she
secretly places flyers around the street - in doorways, on
tables, in letterboxes. She slips away around a corner

Jojo walks to a little table and picks up one of the flyers

Jojo unloads his barrow of metal into a large pile of other
donated things.

Jojo?

He turns to see, Yorki.

Yorki!

The two embrace. Jojo steps back to take in his old friend
who is now dressed in a soldier’s uniform. A cigarette hangs
from his mouth but it’s still the same old dorky Yorki.

JOJO (CONT'D)
You're a soldier now?

YORKI
At your service! I even drink schnapps

and smoke cigarettes now. Except I don’t
light them because they taste like arse.

He theatrically “smokes” with his cigarette which isn’t lit.

It's pretty thin. Is that

 

« paper?

YORKI
Hmm, that’s what I thought at first too.
But it’s “paper-like”. It’s the latest

material invented by our top scientists.

He holds up his arm, the sleeve is way too long.
Jogo
Well, I’m impressed. You finally made it.
Next stop, Hitler’s guard.
Jojo shuffles on the spot.

JOJO (CONT'D)
. I caught a Jew. A real one.

 

Hey York.

YORKI
Wow, good for you! I saw some that they
caught hiding in the forest last month.
Personally I didn’t see what all the fuss
was about. They weren’t at all scary and
seemed kind of normal. But don’t tell
anyone I said that.

Hey what's all that metal stuff? Are you
collecting metal stuff? This gun’s metal
stuff. Argh, I’m getting distracted, I
gotta go!

 

He runs off.

Jojo lightly taps on Elsa’s wall, opens the door and holds
something out for her: the coloured pencils.

And I’m not fishing for anything by the
way. I feel quite strongly about this

ELSA

You will be kissed, Jojo.

Do you want me to kiss you?

gogo
Ok, two things. Thing number one: it’s
illegal for Nazis and Jews to hang out
like we do, let alone kiss, so already
it’s out of the question. And thing
number two: it would just be a sympathy
kiss which doesn’t count.

ELSA
You're not a Nazi.

She's home. You better hide

Lost your key, Mama?

INT/EXT. JOJO'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR ~ CONTINUOUS

Jojo reaches the door and opens it, revealing FIVE MEN in
trench-coats - GESTAPO AGENTS - led by an intense fellow
named CAPTAIN DEERTZ.

DEERTZ

Heil Hitler. Allow me to introduce

myself. I am Captain Herman Deertz of the

Falkenheim Gestapo. This is Herr Mueller,

Herr Junker, Herr Klum, and Herr Frosch.
(then)

Heil Hitler.

gogo
Heil Hitler.

(to Mueller)
Heil Hitler.

MUELLER

Heil Hitler.

JUNKER
Heil Hitler.

Heil Hitler.

FROSCH
Heil Hitler.

JOIO

Heil Hitler.

KLUM
Heil Hitler.

DEERTZ
Now, we--

CONTINUED:

KLENZENDORF (0.S.)
Sorry I’m late, my bicycle got a flat
tire. I carried it.

They are interrupted by Captain Klenzendorf entering,
carrying a bicycle, trailed by Finkel.

DEERTZ
Captain Klenzendorf? Heil Hitler.

KLENZENDORF
Heil Hitler. This is Freddy Finkel.

Finkel joins in and the two men Heil Hitler everyone in the
room all over again. Finally...

KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
So, did I miss anything?

DEERTZ
No, we were just Heil Hitlering each
other and were about to conduct a routine
inspection.

He nods to the other agents who start snooping around the
house, inspecting drawers, cupboards, shelves.

DEERTZ (CONT'D)
And what brings you here, Captain?

KLENZENDORF
We were passing by and wanted to drop off
some pamphlets for the boy. He works for
us.

DEERTZ
I see.

KLENZENDORF
And yourself?

DEERTZ
Oh you know how it is. Routine
inspections. We're following up on a few
leads that will probably lead to nothing,
but it’s all part of the job, isn’t it?

Deertz smiles and moves into Jojo’s bedroom.
DEERTZ (CONT’D)

So, young Johannes, you're helping out at
the Hitlerjugend office.

(CONTINUED)
69.
CONTINUED: (2)

Jogo
Yes.

DEERTZ
Good for you. I wish more of our citizens
had your commitment.

KLENZENDORF
Johannes is a fantastic volunteer. He's
very imaginative.

There is a loud bang upstairs, something being overturned.
Jojo and the Officer look up.

DEERTZ
What on earth are those oafs up to? Why
don’t we go upstairs and see. Yes?

He puts an arm around Jojo and they head upstairs.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS

They stop at Jojo's mother’s room. The officers are looking
through her dresser and wardrobe, under the mattress.

DEERTZ
Do you know where your mother is?

gogo
No. I think she’s in town.

DEERTZ
And tell me, what has she been up to of
late? Does she get to spend much time at
home?

gogo
Well, she is quite busy.

Klenzendorf accidentally knocks over a chair. He exhales
heavily, clearly uncomfortable.

DEERTZ
Is she? Hm. Well it’s good to see you are
still wearing your Jugend uniform.

(beat)
But... where is your DJ knife?

Jojo looks down to his little sheath, it is still empty.
From behind them.

(CONTINUED)
70.
CONTINUED:

ELSA (0.S.)
It's here.

They turn to see Elsa standing at the door to Inga’s room.

She holds the knife in her hand and wears a dress and shirt
of Inga’s. She looks beautiful and... quite German. Jojo is
wide-eyed, panicked.

DEERTZ
And who might you be?

ELSA
Who might YOU be? And what are you doing
in my house?

DEERTZ
You live here too?

Jogo
This... is...

ELSA
(mocking Jojo)
Thisss... isssss...
(to Deertz)
Speak properly idiot. I’m Inga. His
sister.

There is an awkward pause. Klenzendorf COUGHS. Jojo tries to
stall.

gogo
Heil Hitler.

ELSA
Heil. Hitler.

DEERTZ
Heil Hitler.

The others agents join in and we go through another long
round of Heil Hitler salutes, this time with Elsa.

DEERTZ (CONT'D)
I didn’t know you had a sister, Johannes.

ELSA
Well sometimes he'd prefer I was dead.
Wouldn't you, little Frankenstein?

Klenzendorf looks back and forth between everyone, confused

(CONTINUED)
nm.
CONTINUED: (2)

DEERTZ
Now, now, no need to attack his
physicality. It’s a war wound. And why do
you have his knife?

ELSA
I’m guarding my room because he refuses
to stay out of it.

DEERTZ
What do you have hidden in there?

ELSA
(smiling)
Oh you know, girl’s stuff.

Deertz goes to enter Inga’s room.

DEERTZ
May I?

ELSA
Naturally.

He wanders in, inspecting the room. He walks past Elsa’s
secret door. Klenzendorf enters, walks past Jojo, eyeing him

DEERTZ
You see we deal with an overwhelming
number of reports, denunciations, and
general investigations which means we are
severely understaffed and overworked

Deertz opens the curtains and looks out the window

DEERTZ (CONT’D)
Now, of course we are indeed interested
in problems of crime and anti-party
sentiment, but we still have one greater
concern; that of the Goldilocksies,
running amok, taking advantage of other
people in this city. Sneaking around
eating people’s food, sleeping in their
beds... It’s quite rude

(beat, to Elsa)
I don’t suppose I could see your papers
could 1?

Elsa freezes.

DEERTZ (CONT'D)
Hmm?

(CONTINUED)
72.
CONTINUED: (3)

KLENZENDORF
Papers, Ms Betzler. Quickly please, we
don't have all day.

ELSA
Yes, of course.

Elsa goes to a drawer in Inga’s dresser and opens it. She
then tries another drawer and another. Eventually she pulls
out INGA’S PAPERS. Her hand is beginning to shake,
Klenzendorf takes the papers from her and looks at them, now
and then flicking a look to Elsa.

POV of the papers shows Inga when she was sick, GAUNT and
PALE; the two girls share a vague resemblance.

KLENZENDORF
How old are you in this photo?

ELSA
They're 3 years old, I was 14.

KLENZENDORF
Date of birth?

A tense moment as Elsa pauses. Pin drop stuff.

ELSA
May 1, 1929.

Another long pause. Elsa wipes her sweaty hand on her dress.

KLENZENDORF
correct.

(beat)
Thank you Inga. Get a new photo. You look
a bit like a ghost in this one.

Klenzendorf goes to hand the papers to Deertz who waves them
away.

DEERTZ,

Wait. What is this... Yoohoo...Jew?

 

Jojo gulps. Deertz spies Jojo’s BOOK sitting on the dresser.
He opens the book and starts flicking through the pages. The
atmosphere is palpable. Slowly Deertz begins to smile, and
then... he giggles.

DEERTZ (CONT’D)
(stifling laughter)

Oh my... Oh my! Tell me, who did this?

Was it you, Inga?

(CONTINUED)
73.
CONTINUED: (4)

ELSA
Yes, it’s an exposé on Jews, how they
look, behave, think. It’ll be a gift to

the Fuhrer.

DEERTZ
This is amazing. Guys, look at this.

Klenzendorf and the others gather round Deertz as he shows
them Jojo's fantastical drawings and writings. There are
pictures of crazy animals and fairies and magical worlds.

DEERTZ (CONT’D)
Where did you get all of these ideas?

gogo
It's an... exposé. For the Fuhrer.

ELSA
I just said that, Johannes.

DEERTZ
An exposé. Oh, I think he would
absolutely adore this. Oh my, this guy is
riding a dragon. “Mode of Transport”.

(turning a page)

Ooh, this is a drawing of their anatomy.
Look, this one here shows the inside of
their heads. How wonderful.

The officers are all giggling now.

KLENZENDORF
I too am quite an accomplished drawer. I
actually have slightly better perspective
and cross-hatching.

Ignoring him, Deertz points at a drawing of David killing
Goliath.

DEERTZ
Oh look, this guy is killing a giant. oh
boy.
(beat)
And what is this? "Die, Nathan, Die. Ways

of killing Nathan.” Oh this is hilarious.
Look at this guy Nathan, look at all the
ways he’s dying!

(beat)
Tell me, who is this Nathan?

Jojo looks at Elsa sheepishly. She stares at him for a
moment, then looks away.

(CONTINUED)
14.
CONTINUED: (5)

ELSA
No one. Just a stupid boy.

Deertz chuckles. The other officers join in.

DEERTZ
Well, I must thank you for this. You have
really made my day. I do hope you
continue with it. And, of course, if you
see anything suspicious, give us a ring.
Good day.

More Heil Hitlers as they leave. Jojo just stands there
watching.

KLENZENDORF
We're scaling down our operations at the
Youth Office, Jojo, so your participation
is no longer required. Stay home, kid.
Look after your family. Look after this
knife.

Jojo nods. Klenzendorf leaves.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - ELSA’S HIDEOUT - MOMENTS LATER

Jojo finds Elsa huddled in the corner clutching Inga’s
papers.

gogo
Elsa, you fooled them.
ELSA
May 7.
gogo
What?
ELSA

She was born May 7, not the first.

Jojo takes the papers and reads. The DOB read

 

: May 7, 1928.

Jogo
He was helping us.

ELSA

They’1l be back. They’1l find out she’s
dead. Then I’1l be dead.

(CONTINUED)
18.
CONTINUED:

gogo
Nobody really knows Inga died. You can be
her Elsa. It’s okay, 1/11 tell mama
everything when she gets home. I’1l tell
her I know you, that we're friends.

Elsa retreats away from Jojo.

ELSA
Jew and Nazi are not friends.

This hits Jojo. Elsa buries her head into her hands and
begins to cry. She goes into her hideout. Jojo leaves.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jojo sits at the kitchen table twiddling his thumbs while
Adolf, wearing oven gloves, stirs a pot on the stove.

ADOLF
So that was pretty much a bust. I can’t
believe they fell for her disguise. Mind
explaining that?

gogo
She doesn’t seem like a bad person.

ADOLF
(immature)

Poor Jojo, he’s a widdle bit tired and

confused and the only thing he can cook

is invisible soup.

He is suddenly serious, elements of the real Hitler start
building as he gives an impassioned speech.

ADOLF (CONT'D)
I am beginning to question your loyalty
to myself and the party. You say you are
a patriot but where is the evidence? The
German soldier was born out of necessity,
Germany depends on the passion of these
young men, passion and a readiness to
fall for the fatherland.
Their resurrection will be seen in the
rise of the German folk, despite the
futile efforts of Allied war profiteers
who send their ill-prepared armies
clumsily into the lair of the wolf.
(MORE)

(CONTINUED)
16.
CONTINUED:

ADOLF (CONT'D)
And only those zealous men who stand
steadfast in the face of the enemy will
be remembered, their names etched into
German memory forever.
But it is up to you to decide if you want
to be remembered, or forgotten like a
grain of sand, disappearing without trace
into the desert of insignificance

(beat)
To put it plainly - get your shit
together and sort out your priorities.
You're ten, Jojo. Start acting like it

He walks out, dramatically knocking over a cup.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - TOWN SQUARE - AFTERNOON

Jojo wheels his barrow down an alley which opens up into the
town square. He rests a moment and sees a BUTTERFLY moving
past him along a row of flowers.

Jojo smiles at this, takes interest and follows the
butterfly, crouching low to the ground, he follows the
butterfly deeper into the square. Low to the ground, he
admires the butterfly which has now come to a stop upon
another flower.

The butterfly flutters away. Jojo notices the light on the
ground is disturbed by shadows moving back and forth.

He stands.

Right in front of him are a pair of shoes, dangling. He is in
the middle of bodies hanging from the GALLOWS. He backs away
from the body and into another pair of feet. We recognize
these shoes. They are his mother’s

He stumbles back, shaking, tears welling.
After a moment he moves back towards his mother. He tries to
reach her hand. It is too high. He looks back down towards
her shoes and notices her lace is untied. He tries to tie
them but can’t.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - TOWN SQUARE - DUSK

As the sun sets Jojo remains in the park, sitting beneath the
bodies. Quiet. still.
7.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - ELSA’S HIDEOUT - NIGHT

Elsa sits in Inga’s room, reading by candlelight. Jojo enters
the room. Elsa looks down to see he’s holding his DJ knife,
tears streaming down his face.

He walks up to Elsa and stabs her just below the collarbone.
He's too weak to drive it all the way in but she does little
to stop him.

Slowly she raises her hand, places it over his and pulls out
the bloody blade. Blood seeps down her chest. She nods at
him. Jojo struggles against her until he collapses to the
floor. He lies on his back. Elsa kneels next to him. They
look at each other.

EXT. JOJO’S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Jojo and Elsa sit on the ROOF while distant bombing lights up
the horizon.

gogo
Did you know?

ELSA
She didn’t tell me much, only that she
worked with friends and that your father
was somehow involved from afar.

gogo
No, he’s fighting in the war.

ELSA
She said he’ll return as soon as the war
is over. She didn’t want to tell you
anything for obvious reasons.

gogo
(nodding, tearing up)

Because I’m a Nazi. Because she hated me.

I’m the enemy.

ELSA
She didn’t want you to know anything that
could get you in trouble. She wanted to
protect you - more than anything, more
than me. You were the most important
thing to her.

gogo

But they found out what she was doing in
the end. They got her.

(CONTINUED)
78.
CONTINUED:

ELSA
I'm sorry. She died trying to save lives.
That is the greatest honor any person can
achieve.

gogo
But now I have nothing. No one.

Elsa puts an arm around his shoulder. More bombs.

ELSA
The last time I saw my parents was at the
station. They were put on a train. I ran.
Slowly found my way back to the city. A
friend of my father’s hid me. Then
another friend, then friends of
friends... till your mother took me in.
(then)
So far I am still here. But my parents
went to a place you don’t come back from.

Jogo
What is the first thing you'll do when
you're free?

ELSA
Dance.

MUSIC CUE: ‘EVERYBODY'S GOTTA LIVE’ BY LOVE

MONTAGE - JOJO AND ELSA

= Jojo walks past a group of women and other locals as they
clear rubble and debris from their houses.

- Jojo barters with a local PEASANT for some OLD VEGETABLES.

- Elsa draws pictures of her surroundings; the view, the
objects in the room, Jojo.

- Jojo reads Elsa a “Nathan letter”.

- Various shots of the kids living together. Dinners.
Reading. Talking. Being.

= Jojo is out in the snow collecting sticks. He sees a
RABBIT.

= Jojo is eating a water soup while Adolf eats a roast
UNICORN HEAD.

= Jojo's bedroom; Jojo pins another one of Elsa's drawings on
the wall. There are now as many of them as his pictures of
Hitler.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Jojo heads down a street and finds a group of civilian locals
being given weapons and instructions on how to use them.
There are a couple of women and young boys among them, all
looking very out of their element and bewildered.

We hear an explosion a few blocks away. Civilians run the
opposite way towards safety. Jojo moves towards the chaos.

He rounds a corner and sees Yorki, his uniform in tatters,
running on the other side of the street with another kid.
They're carrying a ROCKET LAUNCHER.

Jogo
Yorki!

Yorki sees Jojo, waves, trips and falls. The Rocket Launcher
hits the ground and fires -— sending a missile across the road
where it blows up a shop. GLASS and DEBRIS shower the street.

YORKI
Scheisse! I’m so clumsy.

(beat)
Jojo! I've missed you. I’m sorry about
your mama. I cried for ages when I heard
what happened.

They hug.

Jogo
Yorki, what's going on out there?

YORKI
The Russians Jojo, they’re coming. And
the Americans from the other way. And
England and China and Africa and India
and Australia. The whole world is coming!

Jogo
How are we doing?

YORKI
Terribly! Our only friends are the
Japanese and just between you and me,
they don’t look very Aryan. Germany's
completely run out of money.

(CONTINUED)
80.
CONTINUED:

YORKI (CONT'D)
I mean look at this uniform, it really Is
made of paper. They just glued cotton on
top of it.

He turns around and we see the back of his jacket has been
completely burned off.

YORKI (CONT’D)
I gotta get this ammo to the gunners. You
can help.

Yorki puts the ammo in Jojo’s barrow and they head off.

EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY

The kids make their way down a street, the fire-fight in the
distance getting closer. It’s loud and chaotic. Other
soldiers run around, old people and kids mainly

gogo
Hey, remember that Jew I told you about?

YORKI
Oh yeah. You caught one.

gogo
I still have her. She’s basically my
girlfriend now.

YORKI

Good for you Jojo! A girlfriend!
gogo

But she’s, y'know... Jewish.
YORKI

There are bigger things to worry about
than Jews, Jojo. There’s Russians
somewhere out there. They’re worse than
anyone. I heard they eat babies and have
sex with dogs. I mean, that’s bad, right?

Jogo
Sex with dogs?

YORKI
Yeah, the Englishmen do it too. We have
to stop them before they eat us and screw
all our dogs. It’s crazy. And now
Hitler’s gone we're really on our own.

(CONTINUED)
81.
CONTINUED:

Jogo
What?

YORKI
You didn’t hear? He’s dead. He gave up
and blew his brains out.

gogo
No. That's impossibl

 

YORKI
Blew them out. His brains. Turns out he
was hiding a lot of stuff from us. Doing
some really bad things behind everyone's
backs. I’m not sure we chose the right
side.

Jojo and Yorki round a corner. As they approach another
MACHINE GUN POST we see an ENEMY TANK in the distance trained
on the fortification.

It fires and there’s a huge explosion. The boys drop
everything and RUN OFF.

EXT. BATTLE GROUND - CONTINUOUS

The fighting is more intense and we see more KIDS and OLD
PEOPLE, dressed in stupid paper uniforms, huddled in corners,
trying to figure out what to do. Some are crying.

The boys round a corner and find Fraulein Rahm preparing for
battle. She’s sticking a GRENADE into the back pocket of a
CLONE.

FRAULEIN RAHM
Ok, little clone! Go find a Russian or an
American and give them a big hug!

She pulls the PIN on the grenade and sends the kid out into
the battle.

YORKI
Y'know, I’m not sure we chose the right
side. I’m beginning to wonder if we might
be the bad guys.

FRAULEIN RAHM
Yorki! Here, you've been promoted. Take a
gun and go kill anyone who looks
different to us! Go! Go! Go!

She shoves Yorki out into battle.

(CONTINUED)
82.
CONTINUED:

FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT’D)
Jojo! Here, put on a jacket so you know
what side you’re on!

She hands Jojo a jacket.

FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT'D)
The Russians are over there! The
Americans are that way! We must kill
everything we see! For HITLER!

   

She grabs a massive MACHINE GUN and runs out into the fray.

FRAULEIN RABM (CONT’D)
Die, DEVIL SCUM!!!

Suddenly there’s a huge explosion and the street is engulfed
in smoke and dust - Jojo and Yorki are separated.

YORKI (0.S.)

gogo
Where are you?

 

But Yorki has disappeared. More shots and yelling.

Dazed and disoriented, Jojo makes his way through the haze of
smoke and debris, passing the last defenders of the town —
women, children, the elderly - all desperately trying to fend
off a much stronger enemy, and failing.

KLENZENDORF runs past. We see that he is wearing his uniform
but it has been altered according to his earlier drawing. It
has SPARKLY SEQUINS on the collar, TASSELS down the sleeves.

FINKEL is with him, dressed in a similar outfit. There is an
electric energy between them. Klenzendorf sees Jojo, gives a
triumphant smile, and runs off.

Jojo follow suit and finds shelter behind a wall. He watches
as German soldiers retreat from the enemy. Some are gunned
down, others hide behind vehicles and continue to engage.
There are fires burning throughout and the scene echoes the
crazed frenzy of the book burning bonfire from earlier. Only
this time everyone is confused, freaked out and crying.

Jojo ducks into a doorway and hides in a hole.

FADE OUT.
83.

EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY

Jojo walks through the ruins of his town. He sees a soldier
playing A PIANO in a bombed out house.

German POWs are being led away at gunpoint by AMERICAN
SOLDIERS.

Just then Jojo hears a whimper and looks down to see a dusty
hand reaching out from some rubble.

Jojo lifts an old door up and finds Fraulein Rahm. She's
dying.

FRAULEIN RAHM
Oh, Heil Hitler, Jojo. Can you lift this
building up so I can get out?

She does indeed have a building on top of her.
FRAULEIN RAHM (CONT’D)
fell Hitler 1/11 be waiting for him in
Heaven where everyone is perfect.

She dies.

EXT. TOWN - STREET - DAY

Music blares, it’s an anthem of some sort. Jojo stares wide
eyed as AMERICAN TROOPS officially enter the city in a
convoy. Some people are waving, happy. Others are crying.
Officer Deertz is also there, along with and a couple of his
Gestapo agents being taken away.

A WOMAN holding her child waves at the passing ALLIED CONVOY.
WOMAN
The war is over! America is here!
Everyone is free! We’re all going to get
Levi jeans! America! Americaaaaa!
Tanks pass by. Adolf sits perched on a local STATUE. He's
disheveled and looks frightened.
EXT. BACK STREET - LATER

Jojo walks down a small street. We see more discarded photos
of Hitler and burned Nazi banners.

VOICE (0.S.)
German! Wehrmacht!

(CONTINUED)
84.
CONTINUED:

Just then a Russian Soldier grabs Jojo by the scruff of the
neck and shoves him into a group of German POW’s being
marched at gun point down the street.

Among the group we see Christoph, one the arsehole kids from
the Hitler Youth Camp. He’s crying. We also find CAPTAIN
KLENZENDORF, his revamped uniform in tatters.

Jojo makes his way to Klenzendorf.

Jogo
Captain K! What’s happening?

KLENZENDORF
Hysteria my friend. We’ve come to the
end.

Jogo
Fraulein Rahm is dead. A building fell on
her.

KLENZENDORF

(wiping away a tear)
And my dear Finkel is gone too. I was
very fond of him.

They're led into a private COURTYARD.

EXT. COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS
They're jostled about, pushed and shoved into groups.

RUSSIAN SOLDIER
Move! You, move there!

KLENZENDORF
Hey Jojo. I'm sorry about Rosie. She was
a good person. An actual good person
And I’ve been meaning to tell you, I
think your book is really great. I’m
sorry for laughing at it. There’s some
very important stuff in there. I wish it
was around when all this started.

(beat)
You're a good kid. Now go home and look
after that sister of yours.

He clocks a RUSSIAN SOLDIER approaching. Klenzendorf smiles

at him for a moment before ripping off Jojo’s jacket and
shoving him to the ground.

(CONTINUED)
85.
CONTINUED:

KLENZENDORF (CONT’D)
Get away Jew!

The soldier levels his gun at them.

RUSSIAN SOLDIER
What's going on? You are a Jew?

KLENZENDORF
Yes. He’s scum.

RUSSIAN SOLDIER
Shut up, Nazi.

(to Jojo)
You know this Nazi?

gogo
(pointing at Klenzendorf)
He helped us

 

RUSSIAN SOLDIER
He is Nazi.

(to Klenzendor£)
You know the boy?

A brief moment as Klenzendorf stares at Jojo.

KLENZENDORF
I don’t know this dirty Jew.
Jogo
What?
KLENZ ENDORF

Ugly Jew brat!

The soldier smashes Klenzendorf square in the face with the
butt of his rifle.

RUSSIAN SOLDIER
Shut your mouth Nazi.

(to Jojo)
Jew, get out of here. Go home.

gogo
No!

He and Klenzendorf exchange one more look before the soldier

grabs Jojo and pushes him out onto the street. The large

gates close behind him.

Jojo gets to his feet and dusts himself off.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)
MACHINE GUN FIRE rings out from inside the courtyard.

Jojo runs and, turning a corner...

EXT. TOWN - STREET - MOMENTS LATER

+.bumps straight into Yorki. He’s covered in dirt and ash
and has lost his uniform. He now wears only underpants and an
undershirt.

YORKI
Jojo!

gogo
Yorki! I thought you were dead.

YORKI
No, it seems I can never die.

Jogo

I don’t understand what's happening.
YORKI
Me neither. Nothing makes sense. It’s
definitely not a good time to be a Nazi.
(beat)

I’m gonna go home and see my mother. I
need a cuddle. Hey. So now the war's over
at least your girlfriend will be free.
She can leave now.

Jojo steps back realizing Elsa may leave.

JOIO
I have to go.

He wonders off pondering and confused.

EXT. JOJO’s HOUSE - DAY

Jojo slowly wanders up to his house, pauses a moment outside
the front door, and walks inside.

INT. JOJO’S HOUSE - INGA’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Jojo runs into Inga’s room. It’s empty.

He stands next to the door of her hideout.

INTERCUT between Inge’s room and Elsa’s hideout.

Jojo thinks for a moment. Conflicted, he makes his decision.

JOIO
No. You can’t leave.
ELSA
Who won?
(silence)

Jojo. Who won the war?
She shuffles nervously.
gogo
Germany.
(beat)
Germany won the war.
Elsa looks around at her prison.

ELSA
I thought I could leave.

Jojo stands in the room. Alone.

He moves to the dresser and looks at a family photo, then at
the picture of his sister.

His book - Yoohoo Jew - lies on the dresser nearby. He opens
it and starts leafing through the pages, taking in everything
he and Elsa discussed and worked on together.

He stops at a picture of he and his mother riding their
bicycles.

He turns the page and sees another picture, this time it’s of
a RABBIT IN A CAGE. Outside the cage is a little boy.

Jojo takes a moment, then rips out a blank piece of paper.

gogo
Hi. I have another letter.

Dear Elsa, I know it’s hard for you at
the moment. I know you feel like giving
up. But you have to carry on. Your friend
Jojo and I have devised a plan to help
you escape. So please listen to him. He
will help you get out of there. Then you
can come to Paris and live with me and we
can eat snails and frogs and other
disgusting things that humans aren’t
supposed to eat.

And don’t worry about Jojo, he’ll be ok
when you leave.

(beat)
See you in Paris.

(then)
Nathan.

Elsa’s door opens.

ELSA
He's dead.
Jogo
What?
ELSA

Nathan. He died last year. Tuberculosis.

Jojo holds up his fake letter.

She smiles.

gogo
Oh, that’s weird. But then who wrote
this?

ELSA

Thank you, Jojo. You've been so good to
me.

gogo

Elsa, me and fake Nathan have found a way
for you to escape Nazi Germany.

ELSA
How do I know I can trust you?

gogo
Well, the thing is... I love you. I know

you think of me as a younger brother and
you're too old anyway but-—

(beat)
Man, it’s hot in here.

ELSA
I love you too, Jojo.

gogo
As a younger brother.

ELSA
As a younger brother.

gogo
Well then, maybe you could trust a
younger brother?

She smiles. Maybe.
JOJO (CONT'D)
Okay. Get your things together. We're
leaving.

INT. JOJO HOUSE - JOJO’S ROOM - DAY

Jojo puts on his jacket and looks at himself in the mirror. A
different boy than we met at the beginning of the movie

JOJO (CONT'D)
Jojo Betzler. 10 and a half years old.
Today... just do what you can

 

He turns to walk out of his room, BUT

ADOLF steps into the doorway, blocking his path. He has a
gaping wound on the side of his head where he shot himself.

ADOLF,
Where in the shit do you think you’re
going?

gogo

ADOLF
Oh no you're not. You’re staying right
here and you're going to tell me what the
hell's going on. Be honest.

gogo
I can’t hang around with you anymore. I’m
sorry.

ADOLF
I said be honest.

(beat)
You betrayed me, traitor.

gogo
You betrayed everyone! I believed in you!

ADOLF
But you stopped believing! And now you're
best friends with that thing in the

 

attic.
gogo
That thing is a girl.
ADOLF
You're in love with her aren't you?
gogo
Yes.
ADOLF
Admit it
gogo
I just said yes!
ADOLF
I knew it! Well she’s too old for you and
you're ugly.

Jojo stares at Adolf.

ADOLF (CONT'D)
Fine. I’m sad things didn’t work out with
us, however I’m still kind of proud of
you. Massively disappointed, but also
proud. I like to think of you as my
strange, wayward, disappointing, ugly
son.

Adolf hand:

gogo
I already have a dad and now the war is
finished he’s coming home.

ADOLF
But you need me! I’m all you've got!
You'll never make it out there. You're a
scared little ugly rabbit. You'll die
without me!

s Jojo a SWASTIKA ARMBAND.

ADOLF (CONT'D)
Now you listen to me. I’m going to give
you one last chance to make things right.
You're going to put this on and forget
about that disgusting Jewy cow up there,
and you're going to come back to me where
you belong. Got it?

Jojo screws up the armband and throws it on the ground. Adolf
buckles in pain.

ADOLF (CONT'D)

Heyyy... hey, how about you Heil me,

yeah? Come on, for old times sake?
(beat)

Heil me, little man.

Jogo
No...

ADOLF
Come on, you know you want to. Just a
little Heil. Just a little bittle Heil
for your old friend?

gogo
No. Fuck off Hitler.

And with that, Jojo kicks Adolf as hard as he can in the
balls. Adolf screams as he goes FLYING THROUGH THE WINDOW and
out into OBLIVION.

Hitler is

no more.

S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Elsa by the hand down the hall. They reach the

front door and Jojo notices something.

(CONTINUED )
92.
CONTINUED:

JOO

Wait.
He bends down and ties Elsa’s shoelaces. She watches as he
does this, a small smile creeping across her face. Jojo
finishes and stands.

JOJO (CONT'D)
(smiling)
You ready?

ELSA
Yeah.

Jojo unlocks the door.

ELSA (CONT'D)
Jojo. Is it dangerous out there?

Jojo winks a PERFECT WINK.

Jogo
Extremely.

He opens the door. Light fills the entrance to the house.
They step outside.
EXT. JOJO’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jojo and Elsa stand on the front steps of the house. Elsa
looks at Jojo and then back out to the street.

A car full of celebrating soldiers drives past - an American
flag sticking out the back.

They take in the view and Jojo does a small fist pump.

gogo
Yes... we made it.

Elsa turns to Jojo and stares at him.
She slaps Jojo.
JOJO (CONT'D)
(nodding)
Yep. Probably deserved that.
(then)
So what do we do now?

Elsa shrugs and stands there. And then, ever so subtly, and
very slowly, she begins to sway... rhythmically.

(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Jojo follows suit and moves his shoulders back and forth.
MUSIC CUE: ‘HELDEN’ BY DAVID BOWIE

Jojo and Elsa slowly begin to DANCE - not for anyone else,
just for themselves and each other.
