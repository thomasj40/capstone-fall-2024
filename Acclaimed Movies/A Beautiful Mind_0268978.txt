FADE IN ON:
EXT.-NORTH AMERICA-1947-DAY

The way the world looks to God. The odd puzzle geometry of sea and
land pieced together as if by unseen design. CLOSER. .

VAN NEUMANN (OVER)
Mathematicians won the war...

EXT.-NEW JERSEY-1947-DAY

Alternating squares of lawn and lot, criss-crossing highways, a
game board of cement and grass. CLOSER STILL...

VAN NEUMANN (OVER)
Mathematicians broke the Japanese
codes and built the A-bomb...

EXT.-PRINCETON UNIVERSITY-DAY

Rows of heads. PUSH IN on a single FACE looking skyward, as if he
can see us. Uncommoenly handsome. Piercing blue eyes. JOHN NASH.

VAN NEUMANN (OVER)
Mathematicians like you...

TRACK over the all male students to the head of the common. JOHN
VAN NEUMANN, is delivering the matriculation speech.

VAN NEUMANN
But peace’s flame burns all too
briefly. Atomic weapons are within
Stalin’s reach. You are the vanguard
of democracy and freedom. Today, we
bequeath America’s future into your
able hands. Welcome to Princeton.

The crowd erupts in APPLAUSE.
EXT. - PRINCETON- PRESIDENT’ S RECEPTION

Sunlight dapples the flickering autumn leaves. Students in formal
dress mill. FIND two STUDENTS standing at a bar, sipping martinis.

ZWEIFEL is tall and wiry, like a scarecrow made of skin. SHAPELY is
older, maybe 26, and handsome. Both watch someone in the crowd.

SHAPELY
Milnor’s gonna get the brass ring if
it kills him.
 

 

ZWEIFEL
He’s used to pretty metal.
(taps his teeth)
Silver spoon.

REVERSE on the subject of their musings. A student with shaggy hair
and fiercely intelligent eyes is pumping hands. MARTIN MILNOR.

ZWEIFEL
It’s not enough he won the Carnegie
scholarship.

SHAPELY

Has to have it all for himself.

CAMERA DRIFTS to a third figure standing near them at the bar. John
Nash can’t help but overhear their conversation. Zweifel notices.

ZWEIFEL
First time the Carnegie prize has
been split. Now Milnor’s all bent.

Nash nods, looks again at the young man working the crowd.

SHAPELY
He’s set his sights on the new
military think tank at RAND.

ZWEIFEL
They only recruit the best brain
from each class.

SHAPELY
Milnor’s used to being picked first. -
(extends his hand)
Shapely. Symbol Cryptography.

ZWEIFEL
Shapes broke a Jap code. Helped rid
the world of Fascism. Least that’s
what he tells the girls.
(extends his hand)
Zweifel. Atomic physics. And you
are...

Just then a third FELLOW runs up. Breathless, clever face that
resembles his name. FOX.

FOX
Am I late?

Zweifel and Shapely exchange a look. He’s always late.
 

 

at SHAPELY & ZWEIFEL
Yes.

FOX
(to Nash)
Hi. I’m Fox.

That's when Milnor emerges from the crowd to join his friends.
MILNOR
Ah the burden of genius. So many
supplicants, so little time.

Milnor’s eyes light on Nash. The beat of recognition is so slight
it’s almost imperceptible. Then he smiles.

MILNOR
I‘1l take a white wine.

NASH
Excuse me.

MILNOR

A thousand pardons. I simply assumed
you were the waiter.

 

FOX
Play nice, Milnor.

SHAPELY
Nice is not Milnor’s strong suit.

MILNOR
An honest mistake. What with those
war ration shoes...

Nash's outfit does look off the rack compared to Milnor’s couture.

NASH
It’s not your first mistake. I read
your brief on Nazi ciphers.

With that, Nash offers a slight nod, turns and walks off.

FOX
Who was that masked man?

MILNOR
Gentlemen meet John Nash. The
mysterious West Virginia genius. The
other winner of the distinguished
\ Carnegie scholarship.
Off Milnor. He’s still watching Nash go.
EXT.-PRINCETON-FRESHMAN DORM-SUNSET

The sun is low in the sky. Nash heads into the tall dormitory.
INT.-FRESHMAN DORM ROOM-SUNSET

Nash ENTERS. Small but well furnished. His clothes are still packed
in trunks. Nash pulls off his tie, goes to the window.

Couples and LAUGHING groups move across the sun-drenched field.
Nash rests his forehead against the glass. Alone.

The door swings open behind him. Unruly hair and a tuxedo that
looks slept in whirl into the room. Meet CHARLES HERMAN.

CHARLES
The prodigal roommate arrives.

Charles begins stripping as he speaks. Nash stares in wonder as off
come his jacket and bow-tie.

NASE
Roommate?

CHARLES
Did you know that a hangover is not
having enough water in your body to
run your krebs cycle?
Charles pulls off his pants, and hopping, both shoes.

CHARLES
Which is exactly what happens when
you die of thirst.
Now finally his shirt, which he throws on the couch.
CHARLES
So dying of thirst would feel like
the hangover that finally kills you.
He grabs a towel and heads for the door.

CHARLES
Nash, right? Happy to meet you.

NASH-CLOSE. Speechless.

A TOUCH FOOTBALL GAME-CLOSE. A HAND moves into FRAME, outlining the
players with wax boxes and vectors. WIDER...

INT.-NASH’S DORM ROOM-NIGHT

Nash has moved his desk in front of the picture window, sits now
marking the players positions on the pane.

CHARLES
Officially almost human again.

Charles has ENTERED from the hall, hair wet, towel around his neck.

CHARLES
Officer, I saw the driver who hit
me. His name was Johnny Walker.

Nash continues working as Charles opens the closet, pulls out bags
which he apparently stowed before Nash's arrival. Begins unpacking.

CHARLES
I got in last night. Right in time
for English Department cocktails.
The cock was mine. The tail belonged
to a lovely young thing with a
passion for D.H. Lawrence.

Nash nods, still doesn’t look up from his work.

CHARLES
Not easily distracted, are you?

NASH
I’m here to work.

CHARLES
I see.

Charlies spots a bowl of wrapped amaretto cookies on Nash's desk.
Nash covers the bowl before Charles can grab one, never once
looking up from his pad.

That's when Charles actually climbs up on Nash’s desk, sitting
right in front of him.

NASH
Hey-.

CHARLES
Is my roommate a dick?

Charles reaches into his pocket and pulls out something. A silver
flask. Waves it in Nash's face.

CHARLES
If we can't break the ice, how about
we drown it? .

EXT.-DORM ROOFTOP-SUNSET

Charles and Nash stand under the crimson sky on the roof of the
dorm, passing the flask.

CHARLES
So how’s it go? You the poor boy who
didn't go to Harvard or Yale...

NASH
(brushes his shoulder)
That’s me. Big chip.

CHARLES
Or the nerdy kid the other kids only
liked for his brains?

Nash just shrugs.
“

NASH
My first grade teacher wrote, John
has a beautiful mind. I was five.

CHARLES
Lots of smart people around here.

NASH
But that’s all I am. Smart. I’m not
warm. I don’t do people well.

A couple of guys race, LAUGHING, past, tossing a moonrise football.

NASH
Half these guys already published. I
can’t waste time with books or
classes. I have to come up with a
truly original idea. It’s the only
way I'll distinguish myself. It’s
the only way I‘ll...

CHARLES
Matter.

' Nash glances over to Charles, startled, then just nods.
LD

q

Nash reaches into his pocket, pulls out two wrapped amaretto
cookies. Hands one to Charles.

CHARLES
The cookies help.

Finally, Nash smiles back.
INT. -CLASSROOM-DAY

A MAN towers before the class. Wire-rimmed glasses. The oldest eyes
in the world. PROFESSOR LEW HORNER.

HORNER
The Russians stated goal is
worldwide communism...

Horner moves to the blackboard. Covered with arcane symbols, the
hieroglyphics of high level math.

HORNER
It is on us to stop them. What we
are looking for here is math with
practical application. Morse’s dot
and dash. Einstein’s torn atom.
Numbers that can change the world.

A group of students stare up at him. Zweifel, Milnor, Shapely, Fox
and several others. Only one chair is empty.

HORNER
Results, gentleman. Publishable.
Applicable. Results...

TAPS the board.

HORNER
This is an actual Russian Air Force
code. Can you break it? Mr. Shapely
you're disqualified.

Shapley nods slightly, leans back, lights a cigarette. Horner
scrawls a final set of symbols on the board.

HORNER
All right complete the sequence! Go!

MILNOR
Seven.
 

 

EORNER
{scrawls more symbols)
Good. Again. Hurry, their MIG 15's
are heading our way.

ZWEIFEL °
Seventeen.

HORNER
{scrawls more)
Again. They're closing in on the
Capitol.

MILNOR
Six-

HORNER
(scrawls more)
Again. You can hear the roar of
their Tupolevs-

MILNOR
Seven-

HORNER
(scrawls more)
The warheads are armed-

MILNOR
Seven, seven, one.

Horner sets down the chalk. Wipes the chalk dust from his hands

with a series of CLAPS.

HORNER
Washington owes you a debt of
gratitude Mr. Milnor. Good work.

Horner looks around the room.
. HORNER
From now on, this is how you will
think of numbers. Not as theory. Not
as abstraction. As weapons.

Horner sits back on the desk.

HORNER
My name is Lew Horner and I will be
your teacher. Welcome to Mathematics
in Thought and Action.
q

 

He glances at the empty chair. Then at his roster.

HORNER
Where the hell is...Nash?

Milnor looks out the window. FOLLOW Milnor’s gaze into...
EXT.-PRINCETON COURTYARD-DAY

MILNOR (OVER)
He’s looking for his original idea.

Nash is on his bicycle riding around the courtyard in figure
eights, eyes half-closed, students scattering as he goes.

EXT.-PRINCETON GAMES QUAD-DAY

Stone gaming tables built into the wide cement courtyard. The last
brown leaves whip like dervishes across the expanse.

Van Neumann stands with Milnor, Zweifel, Shapely and a few others
over a GO board set with marbles.

VAN NEUMANN
We study games to study strategic
behavior in conflict...

Fox pushes into the group.

VAN NEUMANN
Thank you for stopping by Mr. Fox.
Put simply, the study of games is
the study of war...

(OVER) a WHISTLING rises, crystal clear. BEETHOVEN’S MOONLIGHT
SONATA. All turn to reveal Nash, walking backwards past them.

VAN NEUMANN
Good day, Mr Nash. Care to join?

Nash looks ‘up, apparently startled by their presence.

NASH
Classes dull the mind and destroy
authentic creativity. No offense.

VAN NEUMANN
None taken.

MILNOR
John’s going to stun us all with his
original idea.
 

 

10
ZWEIFEL

(mouthing)
Psy-cho.

MILNOR
Which is another way of saying he
doesn’t have the nerve to compete.
Milnor RAPS the game table with his knuckles.

MILNOR
Scared?

A beat. Then Nash smiles.
EXT.-PRINCETON GAMES QUAD-MINUTES LATER

Nash faces Milnor across the GO board. The play is incredibly fast.
As they speak, they never take their eyes off the game board.

MILNOR
Let me ask you something, John.

NASH
Be my guest, Martin.

MILNOR
Fox and Zweif correctly predicted
stress fractures on Yeager’s X-1l.

NASH
Adequate work without innovation.
FOX
I’m flattered. Are you flattered?
ZWEIFEL
Flattered.
MILNOR

I’ve got two weapons briefs under
security review by the DOD.

NASH
Derivative drivel.

The pace of play has increased to an amazing speed, less and less
marbles on the board.

MILNOR
But Nash achievements: zero.
 

 

11

NASH
Is there an actual question coming?

MILNOR
What if you never come up with your
original idea? How will it feel when
I‘m chosen for RAND and you're not?

Nash doesn’t answer, concentrates on his play.

MILNOR
What if you lose?

And with that Milnor makes a deft move and takes the game. Nash
sits there. Stunned.

NASH
You shouldn’t have won. The game is
flawed.

MILNOR

Ah, the hubris of the defeated.

Nash is furious, sweeps the board with his hand, rises and walks
away. Milnor smiles, shakes his head.

MILNOR
Gentlemen, the great John Nash.

EXT.-PRINCETON DORM QUAD-SUNSET

Nash stands staring down at a GO board at his feet. His face lined
with deep frustration.

NASH-POV. Different sections of the board suddenly go dark,
patterns of squares rising and falling, forming different shapes
with ever increasing speed.

PULL BACK AND UP TO...

EXT.-PRINCETON DORM QUAD-ACCELERATED TIME

HIGH ANGLE of Nash standing alone in the courtyard, head bowed. The
sun sinks behind the horizon; the moon moves across the starry sky;
and the sun rises again.

NASH-CLOSE. Eyes red in the early morning light. Still staring at
the board. Finally, he blinks, as if for the first. time.

 
12

 

EXT.-PRINCETON GAMES QUAD-MORNING

Fox watches on as Shapely and Zweifel play GO. Nash walks up and
grabs the board in mid-game, marbles CLATTERING to the courtyard.

ZWEIFEL
What the hell-.

Nash pulls something from his back pocket. It’s a knife. The others
jump up. Nash has a maniacal gleam in his eyes.

SHAPELY
John, take it easy-

Nash lifts the board and in two deft strokes, slices away both
sides, leaving a triangle. He drops the cut board on the table.

Nash turns and walks away. The others stare after him.

ZWEIFEL
He’s totally lost it.
FOX
What a whacko, huh, Shapes?
ae But Shapely’s not listening, he’s staring at the new game board.
SHAPELY

Will you look at this....
EXT.-PRINCETON GAMES QUAD-AFTERNOON

TRACK down a row of two-player tables. All sitting over cut-down,
triangular boards. FIND Van Neumann and Milnor walking the quad.

VAN NEUMANN
Your work on hydrogen fusion is
impressive.
MILNOR

I know the boys at RAND are doing H-
bomb research, sir. I’m hopeful-

But Van Neumann has become distracted by two students playing GO on
the triangular board. He moves to them. Milnor follows.

VAN NEUMANN
What have we here?
q

STUDENT
It‘s derived from GO. But variant
outcomes are made impossible by the
shape of the board. Quite simply,
it's perfect, sir.

VAN NEUMANN
Where did it come from?

STUDENT
I don't know. But it’s called Nash.

INT.-LIBRARY-LATE NIGHT

13

TRACK PAST the Librarian, PAST oak tables and green reading lamps,
FIND Nash drawing on the large circular window over the campus.

CHARLES (OVER)
You've been here two days.

Nash turns to find Charles behind him. Jchn looks exhausted.

NASH
Milnor just published another brief.
And I’ve come up with nothing...

Charlies walks to the glass, appraises Nash's work.

CHARLES
Hell, no. You invented window art.

Nash gestures to the first pattern.

NASH
This group represents a game of
touch football...
(off the second pattern)
This was a cluster of pigeons
fighting for bread crumbs....
(off the third)
- And this is a woman chasing a man
who stole her purse....

CHARLES
You watched a mugging?

NASH
In competitive behavior, someone
always loses...

CHARLES
My niece knows that. She’s nine.
 

TN 14
NASH
If I could devise a stratagem where
nobody loses, the effect on arms
negotiations...
Nash‘s jacket hits him in the chest. Nash looks up, startled.

| CHARLES"
When was the last time you ate?

Nash stares at him blankly.

CHARLES
You know, food?

Charlies grabs Nash’s wax pencil from his hand, shoves it in his
pocket, begins walking away.

NASH

You have no respect for the peril of
the free world, do you know that?

CHARLES
Pizza. I have respect for pizza. And
maybe beer...
A beat. Then Nash follows.
EXT.-OLD HOME BAR-PRINCETON-NIGHT

Warm amber light shines through the window of the bar as students
push inside, out of the deepening cold.

INT.-OLD HOME BAR-NIGHT

(OVER) LES BROWN on the jukebox. Students party with co-eds from
neighboring schools. Shapely charms a few girls at the bar.

Nash is at the pool table. Makes a bank shot. Chalks up again.

- ZWEIFEL (OVER)
Who’s winning, you or you?

Zweifel stands with Milnor, who is holding two beers. Hands one to
Nash. John takes the bottle, puzzled.

MILNOR
That new game board is impressive.
Lousy name. But impressive.

That’s when Fox arrives. Gestures the Waitress for a beer.
 

 

15

FOX
Hey. Oh, hey Nash. Wilson tanked.
ZWEIFEL
What?
FOX

Bell Labs new transistor blew his
schematics out of the water.

MILNOR
Those calculations took hima year.

FOX
Packed up in the middle of the
night. Just gone.

Milnor looks at his beer, raises it in silent salute. Drinks.

ZWEIFEL
Hey, Nash, somebody's trying to get
your attention.

Shapely, arm now securely around a luscious brunette, is gesturing
Nash over. The blond GIGGLES, averts her eyes.

Nash puts down his cue warily, heads towards the bar.

MILNOR
This is gonna be good.

INT.-OLD HOME BAR-MOMENTS LATER

Nash is at the bar with BECKY, the blond co-ed. The two stand there
in awkward silence. The moment stretches on. Finally...

Maybe you want to buy me a drink.

Nash appraises her clinically. When he speaks now, his words have
a deliberate quality that belies their speed.

NASH

Look, I don’t know exactly what
things I am required to say in order
for you to have intercourse with me.
But could we assume I’ve said them?
I mean essentially we're talking
about fluid exchange, right? So,
could we go right to the sex?
 

(}

16

BECKY
That was sweet.

She SLAPS him across the face.

BECKY
Have a nice night, asshole.

She walks off. John turns to face the bar.

VOICE (OVER)
Want a piece of friendly advice?

WIDER. Charles has sidled up beside him.

NASH
Is ‘ne’ an actual option?

CHARLES
You may be a genius, but when it
comes to the calculus of human
emotions, you don’t have a clue. So
buy them drinks. Smile. Nod a lot.
And maybe keep your mouth shut.

NASH
What’s unfriendly advice sound like?

Charles CLAPS him on the shoulder and grins.
CHARLES
I especially like the fluid exchange
part.

With that, Charles ruffles his hair and heads for the door. Nash
turns back to the bar. Alone.

EXT.-PRINCETON-FINE HALL-DAY

The commons are pristine fields of snow. The stony facade of Fine
Hall glistens, icicles hanging like sparkling whiskers.

VAN NEUMANN (OVER)
Perhaps your academic progress has
suffered from too much isolation...
INT.-FINE HALL-MATH DEPARTMENT HALLWAY-WALKING

Nash and Van Neumann are walking the long hall, squares of winter
sun and shadow gliding across their faces.
 

 

17

VAN NEUMANN
Human connection gives us
perspective. Friends...

NASH
I don't make friends.
VAN NEUMANN
Why not?
NASH

Apparently I’m an asshole.
Van Neumann would laugh if John wasn’t dead serious.

VAN NEUMANN
The faculty is completing mid year
reviews. We’re making preliminary
placement recommendations.

NASH
RAND would be my first choice, sir.

Van Neumann stares at him incredulously. Finally, shakes his head.

VAN NEUMANN
The game is clever, John. But your
fellows have attended classes,
written briefs, published papers-

NASH
I’m still searching for-
VAN NEUMANN
Your original idea. I know.
(softening)

We had such high hopes for you.

They have come to the door of the math faculty lounge. Professors
sit over small tables being served tea by tuxedo-clad waiters.

NASH
What are they doing?

A professor has risen and crossed. Now he does something peculiar.
Takes his pen from his pocket, lays it in front of a seated man.

VAN NEUMANN
The pens is one of the oldest
tributes at Princeton.
 

18

More and more faculty are rising, lying their pens down in front of
the smiling man.

VAN NEUMANN
Reserved for a member of the
department who makes the
achievement of a lifetime.

Van Neumann takes his own pen from his pocket. Then he pauses,
notices the hunger in John’s eyes.

VAN NEUMANN
What do you see, John?

NASH
Recognition.

VAN NEUMANN
Try seeing appreciation.

NASH
What's the difference?

VAN NEUMANN
(taps his head)
The difference isn’t here.
(taps his chest)
It’s here.

John just stares at him blankly.
VAN NEUMANN
John, I asked to see you because
your record doesn’t warrant any
placement at all.

NASH
Sir, I can still-.

- VAN-NEUMANN
No, som. You can’t. I’m sorry.

John stares at him. Van Neumann smiles sadly. Then he walks inside,
leaving John alone, looking in.

INT.-NASH'S DORM ROOM-LATE AFTERNOON

Nash stands, forehead against the picture window, staring out. The
glass is covered with elaborate wax patterns.

NASH
I can see it, come on, come on...
 

 

 

19
Nash CRACKS his head, hard, on the glass, spiderwebbing the window.

CHARLES (OVER)
Jesus.

WIDER. Charles is sitting up on his bed, looking sleepy, sheet
around his shoulders. He puts his feet on the floor. Smiles grimly.

CHARLES
What did that window ever do to you?

John turns to him now, the despair on his face palpable.

NASH
I can’t fail. Do you understand?

John turns back to look back out the window. When his VOICE comes
again there is a defeat that is chilling.

. NASE
This is all I am.

John SLAMS his head into the glass again, hard.

CHARLES
John, stop-

John spins, pleading eyes full of rage and anguish.
NASE
I can’t fail. There’s no reason for
me then. Do you understand? Do you?!
Charles stares at him a long beat. Finally...

CHARLES
...Yes.

This seems to give Nash some small comfort. A long beat. Then he
walks to the desk, begins to pull it backwards from the window.

: NASE
No more staring out. Face the wall.
Read their books, attend their
classes...

Charles stares at him a beat. He nods slowly.

CHARLES
You’re bleeding.
 

 

20

Charles rises, hands him a towel. As John begins to tamp his
forehead, Charles puts his hands or. the edge of the desk.

CHARLES
You know, friend Nash; if you want
to win your own way...

Charles pulls the desk back from the window, but doesn’t let go.
Instead he bends, as if for traction.

CHARLES
You can’t play by their rules....

Charles begins shoving the desk towards the window...

NASH
What are you-

The desk HITS and SMASHES through the glass.
EXT.-DORM ROOM-LATE AFTERNOON

The desk blows through the window, tumbling two stories to the
ground in an EXPLOSION of wood and floating sheets of paper.

EXT.-DORM ROOM-CONTINUOUS

Nash stands with Charles looking down, out of the broken picture
window at the still settiing debris.

CHARLES
Heavy.

Nash nods, can’t help a shocked grin.

NASH
No witch’s slipper. Good thing.

CHARLES
- Your answer isn't, face the wall.
It’s not in their books and in their
classes. It’s out there, right where
you've been looking. When they tell
you to look away, you’ve just got to
look closer. Do you understand?

Nash stares at him a beat.

NASH
You're kind of strange, aren’t you?
 

21

CHARLES
Coming from you, do you have any
idea how much that scares me?

INT.-OLD HOME BAR-NIGHT

(OVER) Sinatra on the juke. Our boys are playing pool. John sits
alone, staring at the floor.

MILNOR
The Soviets just barred the UN from
entering North Korea.

SHAPELY
Germany’s next. They’11 build a wall
right down the middle. Watch.

ZWEIFEL
Russians were cold once. Thousands
died. They will not be cold again.

MILNOR
Incoming.

Milnor is gesturing to the door. About six women have entered the
bar. Well, five and one. The BLOND in the lead is simply, perfect.

PAN ACROSS the guys’ stunned faces.
INT.-OLD HOME BAR-LATER

The group sits talking, casting furtive glances at the Blond and
her girlfriends a couple of tables away.

MILNOR
I’m going to buy her a drink.

NASH
That’s creative.

ZWEIFEL
Will she want a large wedding?

SHAPELY
One beauty, too many suitors.

FOX
Swords, gentlemen? Pistols at dawn?

MILNOR
We apply Adam Smith’s benevolent
hand.
 

22

FOX
In competition, individual ambition
serves the common good.

SHAPELY
Every man for himself.

ZWEIFEL
Those who strike out end up with her
friends.

John nods. Then his gaze fixes on the girls.

ZWEIFEL
She‘s looking over. I think she’s
looking at Nash.

MILNOR
He may have the advantage now. But
wait until he opens his mouth.

But John doesn’t respond to the taunt. Instead he continues to
stare intently at the girls.

MILNOR
Nash? Hey, Earth to Nash.

But Nash doesn’t take his eyes off the girls’ table.

NASH
Adam Smith was wrong.

MILNOR
What are you talking about?

NASH-POV. The girls’ table grows dark, only the blond girl
highlighted, moving into the foreground.

NASH (OVER)
- If everyone competes for the
blond...

NASH-POV. Images of all the boys surround the blond, then blow
apart like fragments of glass, leaving the blond standing alone.

NASH (OVER)
.«..we block each other and no one
gets her.

NASH-POV. The other girls rise into the foreground, images of our
boys pairing off with them.
 

ae

23

NASH (OVER)
...S0 then we go for her friends...

NASH-POV. All the other girls suddenly go dark, leaving our group
standing alone.

NASH (OVER)
»--But they give us the cold
shoulder, because no one likes to be
second choice. Again, no winners.

NASH-POV. The blond girl goes dark.

NASH (OVER)
...But what if none of us go for the
blond...

NASH-POV. Now images of the boys pair up with the remaining girls.

NASH
...We don’t get in each other’s way,
we don’t insult the other girls.

NASH-POV. The world goes dark except for the couples which twirl
like a mobile of arabesques in a victorious swirl.

NASH (OVER)
That’s the only way we win. That’s
the only way we all get laid.

All are staring at him.

NASH
Adam Smith said the best outcome for
the group comes from everyone trying
to do what’s best for himself.

. MILNOR
Yes, Nash, it’s the basis for all of
modern economic theory.

NASH
He was wrong. The best outcome comes
from everyone trying to do what‘s
best for himself and the group.

MILNOR
Nash, if this is some plan for you
to get the blond alone...

But Nash isn’t listening. He’s already pulling on his coat.
 

 

 

24
NASH
Don’t you see? Adam Smith was wrong.
The father of economics was wrong.

And with that he’s grabbed his coat, heading out the door, his
puzzled friends watching on.

FOX
Could he be weirder?

HOLD on Milnor. Face darkening with concern.
EXT.-NASH’S DORM ROOM WINDOW-NIGHT

Nash sits bent over his pad, working. Within the window frame Nash
continues to work, time passing normally. PULL BACK AND OUT...

EXT.-NASH’S DORM-ACCELERATED TIME

Outside, snow covers the building, then melts, and tendrils of ivy
snake up the concrete facade and bloom, all while Nash works on.

INT.-VAN NEUMANN'S OFFICE-DAY

Van Neumann sits across the desk from Nash, holding Nash’s
handwritten paper in his hand.

VAN NEUMANN
You came up with this on a dating
excursion?
Nash simply nods.
VAN NEUMANN

You realize this refutes one hundred
and fifty years of economic theory?

NASH
I do, sir.
. VAN NEUMANN
That's rather presumptuous, don’t
you think?
NASH
Yes, sir.

Van Neumann stares at the young man. Drops the paper on his desk.
 

Lit map-boards of the cold war globe.
early IBM computers. A young CAPTAIN stands on a grillwork landing.

VAN NEUMANN
Well, Mr. Nash, this document may be
the single most important work on
competitive bargaining I have seen.

Thank you, sir.

VAN NEUMANN
It has immediate applications to
current peace and arms negotiations.
You‘ll get any placement you want.
Most of the top programs will let
you bring two support people.

NASH
I’1ll take Fox and Zweifel sir.

Van Neumann raises an eyebrow. Leans back in his chair.

NASH
I did it, didn’t I sir?

VAN NEUMANN
Yes, John. You did.

General, the team from RAND is here.

REVERSE. Two uniformed TECHNICIANS, a senior ANALYST and a GENERAL
stand before a wall papered with sheets of numbers.

The Captain hits a button. A red wall light goes green. Three MEN
in raincoats ENTER, faces obscured by the shadows of their hats.

CAPTAIN
General Wilson, this is RAND team
leader...
The lead man removes his hat to reveal...

CAPTAIN
...Dr. John Nash.

Close cropped hair. Four years since we have last seen him.

GENERAL
Glad you could come, Doctor.

Nash nods. Hands his overcoat and gloves to one of his Aides. He is
wearing a slim black suit and tie. The General nods to the Analyst.

ANALYST
We have been interceptin radio
transmissicns from Moscow.

GENERAL
The computer can’t detect a pattern.
But I’m sure it’s code.

NASH
Why is that, General?

GENERAL
Ever just know something, Dr. Nash?

Nash actually smiles.

NASH
Constantly.

Nash moves to the wall papered with code.

GENERAL
We have developed several ciphers-

But Nash raises his hand, silencing the officer. He stands still,
just staring at the numbers. Then Nash begins to WHISTLE.

PUSH IN ON Nash’s eyes. In the black ocean of his pupils, the
reflected rows of code begin to move, forming shifting patterns.

PULL BACK ON Nash, still staring at the wall. Hours have passed,
folks sitting, jackets hanging on chair backs, coffee cups empty.

NASH-POV. Series of numbers darken as others rise, a cascade of
rapidly changing patterns, endless permutations until...
 

 

27

NASH
There.

Nash opens his hand to a pencil from one of his rising Aides. He
walks to the wall, begins circling various numbers. All stare.

NASH
I need a map. North America I think.

The General and the Analyst exchange a look. The General nods and
the Captain illuminates a map Board of North America.

NASH
These are longitudes and latitudes.

Nash is already marking the map board.
NASH
They appear to be routing orders.
Ways across the border into the US.

Nash glances upwards. From a glass booth overlooking the room, a
MAN is watching him. Fine dark suit. Thin tie.

NASH
Who’s Big Brother?

GENERAL
Excuse me?

But when Nash looks up again, the booth is empty. The Man has gone.
NASH
What are the Russians moving,
General?
But the General just claps him on the shoulder.
GENERAL
You've done your country a great
service, son.

The General turns, Nash watching as the men begin tearing down the
sheets of code from the wall.

INT.-MIT RAND HEADQUARTERS -WALKING

Bustling. And hot. Nash is walking down a long, sun-lit corridor.
A fellow falls into step with him. It’s Fox.

FOX
Home run at the Pentagon.

NASH
Have they actually taken the word
classified out of the dictionary?

FOX
Please. This is the military. The
only place information travels
faster is high school.

4 Fox, how about you call me chief or
boss or something?

FOX
How about you blow me?

NASH
That’s what I figured.

Nash strips off his jacket. Another figure falls into step with
them, a file folder in his hand. Zweifel.

ZWEIFEL

NASH
Exactly how are we supposed to keep
the world safe for democracy if
we’re stewing to death?

FOX

That’s two more than we‘ve had.

ZWEIFEL

Moscow has the H-bomb...

Zweifel and Fox exchange a look. They know what's coming.

NASH
Stalin’s practically loading vV2's
with biological payloads by hand...

And we’re doing stress tests for a
new dam.

Nash begins rifling his mail. A letter to Charles Herman at U
Texas. Stamped: Return To Sender-Address Unknown.

ZWEIFEL
You made the cover of Forbes. Again.

FOX
Please note the use of you not we.

FORBES-CLOSE. Nash lifts the magazine from his mail pile. The cover
reads, America’s geniuses. Four portraits. John looks pissed.

NASH
It was supposed to be just me.

ZWEIFEL
John, exactly what’s the difference
between genius and most genius?

NASH
Everything.

FOX
{rolling his eyes)
He’s your son.

ZWEIFEL
Anyway, you’ve got ten minutes-

NASH
I've always got ten minutes.

FOX
Before your first class.

NASH-CLOSE. Actually pales.

NASH
Can’t I get a note from a doctor?

ZWEIFEL
You are a Doctor. And no. You know
the drill. We get facilities...
FOX
MIT gets America’s great minds of

Fox thrusts a briefcase into Nash's arms.

Screw you both. Really.
And with that, he’s gone.

ZWEIFEL

INT.-MIT CLASSROOM-AFTERNOON

(OVER) The CONSTRUCTION RACKET. Maybe two dozen grad students sit
restlessly at their desks, sweating, fanning themselves, windows
open to the meager breeze.

Nash ENTERS in his t-shirt. He deposits his briefcase on the desk,
stares out at the class like a soldier eying the enemy.

NASH
What the hell is that racket?

Nash begins closing windows, shutting out the CONSTRUCTION NOISE.
 

 

31

STUDENT
Can we leave one open Professor?
It's really hot, sir...

Nash has returned to the board. Turns to face the boy who spoke.

NASH
Your comfort comes second to my
ability to hear my own voice.
Personally, I am certain this class
will be a deadly waste of both your,
and worse, my time. But, here we
are. Attend or not. Complete the
assignments at your whim. We begin.

PAN across the stunned faces. A beat. Nash returns to the board.
NASH
This non-linear equation should take
you several months to solve....

Nash trails off. A GIRL, maybe 20, has risen. Exquisite. Powerfully
intelligent eyes. A dancer’s body. This is ALICIA LARDE.

NASE
Miss...

She crosses the room, turns now and holds Nash’s gaze a beat. Then
she pushes open a window.

Folks just stare, stunned, as she pokes her head outside, begins
TALKING. We hear only random WORDS, then LAUGHTER.

THROUGH THE WINDOW. The Construction Workers move off.

See the look she gives him, as stunning as it is impassable. A
beat. Then Nash offers the barest nod. Turns back to the board.

NASH
As I was saying, this equation..

PULL BACK over Nash as Alicia continues around the room, opening
every window to the breeze.

Nash inspects the Department of Defense photo ID and badge,
embossed with a government seal. Meeti WILLIAM PARCHER.

NASH
So, what can I do for the DOD?

EXT.-MIT-RAND COMPOUND-WALKING

Parcher is leading Nash away from the main RAND building, deeper
into the fenced off military compound.

PARCHER
Impressive work at the Pentagon.

John just nods.

PARCHER
Oppenheimer used to say genius sees
the answer before the question.

NASH
You knew Oppenheimer?

PARCHER
His project was under my command.

NASH
Which project?
(eyes widening)
That project?

Nash stops, terribly impressed. William just shakes his head.

PARCHER
It’s not that simple, you know.

- NASH
You ended the war.

PARCHER
We burned up two hundred thousand
people in a heartbeat.

NASH
Great deeds come at great cost.

William’s smile, coming now, is very old.
 

 

33

PARCHER
Conviction is a luxury of the those
on the sidelines.

William resumes walking. John falls into step.

PARCHER
No close friends. No family. Why is
that, John?

NASH
Get to know me.

Parcher’s LAUGH catches Nash by surprise.

They have come
All abandoned,

PARCHER
There are endeavors where your lack

paint chipping, windows boarded up.

PARCHER
Ever been here?

NASH
We were told during orientation
these warehouses were abandoned...

PARCHER
That’s cover. Military speak for a
lie.

They have arrived at a warehouse at the end of the row. New
windows, a fresh coat of paint. A soldier standing guard salutes.

 

PARCHER
Your life exists on the surface of a
mighty ocean. What lies underneath,
forces colliding, ready to break the
surface at any moment and shatter
the calm, that’s my world.

NASH
Good speech.

PARCHER
It should be.
(sad smile)
I’ve made it enough times.

William walks to the door, pulls it open.
INT.-MIT RAND COMPOUND-PARCHER’S WAREHOUSE

Sprawling. White suited Technicians scurry back and forth amidst
hi-tech computing machines and giant illuminated globes.

NASH
This isn’t possible. Half this
technology is a good ten years off.

PARCHER
We have labs like this all over the
nation. We use them to exploit our
best minds.

William leads the ogling Nash through the maze of equipment towards
a large glass office.

PARCHER
Minds like yours.

INT.-MIT RAND-PARCHER'S OFFICE

Nash sits across the desk. Photos of William with Roosevelt; with
Einstein; in a Colonel’s uniform with an allied liberation force at
the gates of a concentration camp.

PARCHER
(noticing his gaze)
Dachau. Man is capable of as much
- atrocity as he has imagination.

William looks off a beat. Eyes that have seen too much. Then...
PARCHER
By telling you what I am about to
tell you I am increasing your
security clearance to Top Secret.

William slides a form with a government watermark across the desk.
 

 

35

PARCHER
Whether or not you agree to assist
in this operation, disclosure of
secure information can result in
imprisonment. Get it?

NASH
What operation?

PARCHER
Please sign.

John signs the form, slides it back. William nods. Then he lifts a
small remote control, points it at a blank TV screen in the wali.

NASH
(off the remote)
Those are a good idea.

ON SCREEN-A placard reading Eyes Only is replaced by black and
whites of a giant factory, US soldiers scattered in every frame.

PARCHER (OVER)
This factory is in Berlin. We
seized it at the end of the war.

ON SCREEN-Closer shots of large, complex production equipment.

PARCHER
Nazi engineers were attempting to
build a portable atomic bomb.

NASE
What?

William looks up at John a beat, then back to the screen which now
shows a device no larger than a television.

PARCHER
The Soviets reached this facility
before we did. The technology evaded
our capture. We lost the damn thing.

NASH
You're telling me the Russians have
a handy atomic bomb?

PARCHER
Yes.

William just stares at him, letting this sink in.

 
 

 

 

Simple as that.

NASH
The routing orders at the Pentagon.
They were for this...

PARCHER
A splinter group of the Soviet Army
calling itself New Freedom intends
to detonate the bomb on U.S. soil.

NASH
Where? When?

PARCHER
All we know is that their target is
not military. They hope to incur
maximal civilian casualties in order
to initiate a nuclear conflict.

NASH
Why?

PARCHER
Because they can win.

NASH
...What‘s the payload?

PARCHER
Two kilotons. The ground burst wili
kill 30,000. Another 100,000 will
die from radiation spill.

NASH
God help us.

PARCHER
Take a number. Intel suggests New
Freedom's sleeper agents here-

NASH
In the U.S.?

PARCHER
Mccarthy is an idiot. Unfortunately,
that doesn’t make him wrong.

PARCHER
New Freedom is communicating to its
agents through codes embedded in i
periodicals and newspapers. That's :

unique abilities.

Nash stares at him.

NASH
Tell me what you want me to do.

INT.-PARCHER’S WAREHOUSE-MOMENTS LATER

Nash and William stand over a monitor manned by a Technician.

John looks at the list. Nods.

William stands with John at another work-station. A Technician has
lowered what appears to be large x-ray machine over his arm.

TECHNICIAN
This may be uncomfortable.

The machine makes contact with John’s arm and HISSES.

NASH
- What the-?

The Technician lifts the machine, shines a black light over John’s
wrist. In a fresh welt above his wrist we see a series of numbers.

He implanted a radium diode under

Nash looks up to see a figure standing in his doorway. Alicia, a
soldier-escort behind her.

ALICIA
Boy, you must really be important.

Nash stares a beat. Then he shakes his head.

NASH
It’s all right, Mike.

The Soldier tips his hat to Alicia and is gone.

NASH

Alicia throws her hair and GIGGLES, the very picture of a sex
kitten. Then she brings the intelligence back into her eyes.

Nash simply stares at her.

ALICIA
Class. You missed class today.

NASH
Oh.

He resumes working. Alicia slides a single page atop his magazine.

ALICIA
The equation you left on the board.
I solved it.

Nash barely glances at her paper as he hands it back.

NASH
No. You didn’t.

ALICIA
You didn’t even look.

NASH
There’s an error in the second to
last sub-valuation.

Alicia stares at him. Then looks back at her equation. Frowns.

Alicia beams.

NASH
On occasion.

He sizes her up. A long beat, then...

NASH
Leave your address with my office.
I'll pick you up Friday at eight.

Nash goes back to work.

ALICIA
I’m dismissed now?

NASH
You're dismissed now.

Alicia smiles a wry smile, starts for the door. Nash calls after...

NASH
One more thing.

Alicia turns back to him, sunlight through the window striking her
face so perfectly it steals your breath.

NASH
What's your name?

Alicia and Nash inspect a Rothko on the wall. Alicia is rivetted.
ALICIA
I think God must be a painter. Why

else would we have so many colors?

Nash nods. But he’s not listening, looking instead at two non-
descript MEN at the bar. They notice his gaze, look away.

NASH
(distracted)
So, you’re a painter?

ALICIA
That's not actually what I said.

She raises her hand. Faint paint-stains color her skin.

ALICIA
But, yes.

The two Men at the bar are watching Nash again. This time, when
they catch his eyes, they move off.

ALICIA
I’m also a burlesque dancer...

Nash nods, following the Men with his eyes.

ALICIA
I started stripping for the infantry
in France, then moved up to fly
boys. They call me Cha-Cha physics.

Um-hmm.

He's still staring across the room. That's when she kicks him,
hard, in the shin. He starts. That got his attention.

WIDER. Standing behind the man is Nash, two beading flutes of
champagne in his hands.

YOUNG MAN

The fellow heads off. John hands her a glass, comes to stand next
to her. They stare out across Beacon Hill at the glittering city.

ALICIA
Nothing like a little gab about

process into high gear.

Nash nods, glances inside the door. The same two Men.

ALICIA

Why don’t you just talk to them?
NASH

Who?
ALICIA

The two men who keep staring at you?

Nash looks startled. Alicia begins backing towards the door.

ALICIA
I used to stare before I met you
too. You're famous, remember?

NASH
Alicia, wait-

Alicia opens the balcony door, face to face now with the Men.

ALICIA
Hi, there.

The Men stare at her, startled. Then emerge onto the balcony.

NASH
I'm close to something here.
FOX

You skip work. You miss briefings.
Me and Zweif, we’re worried about
you.

Nash is now taping magazine pages to the wall. Fox lifts a file of
articles off a cabinet. All on Hiroshima.

FOX
We're not doing anything on the
Hiroshima bomb...

Nash retrieves the file without speaking, deposits it out of Fox's
reach on his desk.

FOX
That was polite.

NASH
- Did you know the initial blast was
so bright it left only shadows?

Nash looks at Fox for the first time. His eyes aren’t just tired.
They're haunted.

NASH

benches, on schoolyards, on

sidewalks. They’re still there.

Fox starts to speak. But Nash just raises his hand.

Nash gathers up several pages and the map, puts them in a gray RAND
envelope. He takes a stick of sealing wax, lights the wick...

EXT.-CAMBRIDGE STREET-NIGHT

(OVER) CRICKETS. Nash is walking, alone, past large houses set
apart on larger lots, his sealed, grey RAND envelope in his hand.

He stops before a giant wrought iron gate, behind which sits a
resplendent white colonial mansion, lights burning in every room.

On the gate, a small keypad is illuminated by the purple glow of a
tiny buib. Nash stares at the keypad, reaches forward.

NASH'S WRIST-CLOSE. In the purple light, a new set of numbers
appear beneath the surface of his skin.

He rubs his wrist in wonder. Then enters the numbers into the
keypad. The lock CLICKS open. Nash pushes the gate wide.

Beyond the gate is a free standing mailbox. Freshly painted wrought

EXT.-WALDEN POND-WATER‘S SURFACE-MOVING

CAMERA rushes over the water's surface towards two figures swimming
the breast stroke, coming head on in a dead heat across the pond.

Nash is in the lead, Alicia maybe three strokes behind him. Both
are swimming fast. But the race is John’s.

He pulls himself up onto the shore. A few seconds later Alicia
hoists herself onto land beside him.

Both are beautiful, fit and trim. Their breathlessness is as much
a function of their glistening proximity as their exercise.

And she begins pulling off the top of her bathing suit, stripping
it down to her waist. .

ALICIA
I couldn't.

And he goes to her.
INT.-NASH’S APARTMENT

Nash and Alicia make love on the desk under the siatted light
spilling in from the street. PAN DOWN...

On the floor are several of John’s newspapers, marked up with his
code-breaking scrawl. Fallen to the floor. Forgotten.

EXT.-BEACON HILL-DAY

Nash stands atop the hill, looking out at the city beyond.

Suddenly downtown Boston erupts with a low nuclear cloud. Next
comes the white light, then the blast wave, leveling buildings,
whipping toward Nash in a colossal wave of ruin.
INT.-NASH'S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT

Nash bolts up in his bed, sweating and breathless from the
nightmare. He looks down at Alicia, asleep peacefully beside him.

EXT.-MIT COMMONS-DAY

Nash sits under a tree, marking up another magazine. A little girl
(MARCEE, 9) walks up to him.

MARCEE
What ya doin?
Nash looks up at her.
NASH
I am attempting to isolate patterned
recurrences across periodicals

across time. And you?

MARCEE
Chasin’ pigeons. You talk funny, Mr.
Nash.
NASH
(frowning)

Do I know you?

MARCES
My uncle says you're very smart but
not very nice so I shouldn’t pay you
no mind if you're mean to me.

NASH
And who might that uncle be?

VOICE (OVER)
The prodigal roommate returns.

Nash looks up and standing over him is Charles. Nash grins.
EXT.-MIT CAMPUS-WALKING

Nash and Charles stroll together. Marcee runs a few yards ahead,
chasing pigeons, eyes wide with a child’s fascination.

CHARLES
My sister got herself killed in a
car crash. Husband was too drunk to
know he was too drunk to drive. I
took Marcee in.

NASH
She‘s so small.

CHARLES
She’s young. That's how they come.

the pigeons. To her dismay, they don’t react.

CHARLES
I‘m doing the great. authors workshop
at Harvard. D.H. Lawrence.

NASH
Very fitting. Very fancy.

CHARLES
Well, I have been reading about you.
How are you, John?

NASH
At first it was all bureaucratic.
Nothing I did mattered. Then

something came up. ...I can’t talk
about it.
CHARLES
Top Secret, Black Bag, Black Ops?
NASH
Something like that. And....
CHARLES
Yes.
NASH

I’ve met a girl.

CHARLES
You buried the lead.

NASH
She's beautiful and brilliant...

in silence. Then...

NASH
Should I marry her?

CHARLES
Hell, you buried the whole story.

/ NASH
I mean, it all seems to add up. But
how do you know for sure?

CHARLES
Nothing’s ever for sure. That’s the
only sure thing I know.

That’s when Marcee runs up, her expression grave.

MARCEE
I can’t make the pigeons fly.

NASH
Put your arms up and roar like a
monster.

MARCEE
Are you being mean and I shouldn’t
pay you no mind?
A beat. Then Nash smiles.
EXT.-MIT COMMONS-DAY

Two men and a little girl, arms high, ROARING like monsters,
through the pigeons, the birds soaring away, taking flight.

EXT.-APARTMENT ROOF
Nash and Alicia drink beers, watch the last of the sunset.

NASH
Charles used to say, if you want
- divine inspiration, give God an
unobstructed view.

ALICIA
And what quandary requires the help
of the All Mighty herself?

NASH
Io am trying to determine if our
relationship warrants commitment.

Alicia LAUGHS, looks away.

ALICIA
Give me a moment to redefine my

Okay. So, how goes the task?

NASH
I require a proof. Some kind of
verifiable empirical data.

ALICIA
You say the sweetest things.

at her blankly. She smiles.

ALICIA
How big is the universe?
NASH
Infinite.
ALICIA

How do you know?

NASH
I know because all the data
indicates that it’s infinite.

ALICIA
But have you seen it?

NASH
No.

ALICIA

Then how do you know for sure?

NASH
I just believe it.

ALICIA
It’s the same with love, I imagine.

Nash stares out at the sunset.

ALICIA
The part you don’t know. Is if I
want to marry you.

HOLD on Nash. That really hadn't occurred:to him. He blanches.

NASH
Alicia...

ALICIA
Oh no. Don’t even think it. You’re
looking at a really big ring...
EXT.-WALDEN POND-SPRING

Shapely, Fox and a few of Alicia’s friends hurl rice. John and
Alicia pose as folks snap pictures.

John notices a figure standing at the edge of the trees. William.

A flash catches John’s attention. When he turns back to the woods,
William is gone. :

EXT.-CAMBRIDGE STREET-NIGHT

NASH'S WRIST-CLOSE. In the glow of the purple light, a new set of
numbers shine through the skin. WIDER.

Nash punches in the codes, pushes open the gate, a new sealed crey
RAND envelope in his hand. He drops the envelope into the slot.

LF (OVER) a SCREECHING of tires. CAR HEADLIGETS turn onto the street.
Nash stands frozen, the car bearing down on him.

Suddenly the car SCREECHES to a halt. A figure is SHOUTING from the
driver’s seat.

PARCHER
In! Fast!

INT.-CAR-CAMBRIDGE STREET-NIGHT
William GUNS the engine before Nash’s door is even closed.

NASH
What the hell-

PARCHER
Are they following?

NASH
Who?
(looking over his shoulder)
Shit!

OUT THE BACK WINDSCREEN. Another set of headlights SCREECHES around
the corner, in close pursuit.

 
 

55

PARCHER
The drop has been compromised.

(OVER) a sharp CRACK. The back window shatters.
PARCHER
(shouting)
Down.

John ducks. William cuts around the corner, SLAMMING John, hard,
into the car door.

PARCHER
Take this.

William, still steering with one hand, tosses something onto the
seat. A revolver. Nash just stares at him blankly.

PARCHER
Return fire.

NASH
I don’t know how-

PARCHER
Out the window! Shoot, goddamnit.

EXT.-BOSTON STREETS-NIGHT

The pursuit car is gaining. A shadowy figure leans out of the
passenger side window, gun in hand. He FIRES.

INT.-PARCHER’S CAR-BOSTON STREETS-MOVING

(OVER) Another CRACK. A bullet lodges in the windshield between
Nash and William, spider-webbing the glass.

PARCHER
Shoot the fucking gun.

Nash just stares at the weapon. William grabs the revolver, tries
steering with one hand and SHOOTING out the window with the other.

EXT.-BOSTON STREETS-SHORE OF THE CHARLES-NIGHT
William’s car turns onto the riverfront, the chase car in close

pursuit. William and the shadowy gunman exchange FIRE as the two
cars race along the moonlit edge of the Charles.

INT.-PARCHER’S CAR-MOVING
PARCHER
Hang on. I’m going to try and get a
better shot.
* NASH
(frantic)
Can’t we just get away?
William spins the wheel, hitting the brakes, wheels SCREECHING...
EXT.-BOSTON STREETS-SHORE OF THE CHARLES-NIGHT

William’s car spins broadside. The pursuit car is bearing down on
them. William aims out the window and FIRES, SHOT after SHOT.

The pursuit car keeps coming. William let's off a final VOLLEY, the
pursuit car now virtually on top of them.

At the last instant, the villains’ windshield SHATTERS, the pursuit
car skidding off the road and flying, hard, into the water.

INT.-PARCHER'S CAR-MOVING
CLOSE on John’s eyes. Wide with disbelieZ.
EXT.-SHORE OF THE CHARLES-NIGHT

William and Nash emerge from their car, watching as the last signs
ef the sedan are swallowed by the black water.

NASH
You just-

PARCHER
(adrenalized)
Don’t think about it. It never
happened. Do you understand me?

Nash nods dumbly.
PARCHER
We have a leak. They know our

operative is at RAND. They just
don’t know who.

John manages to nod again.

PARCHER
Keep working. We'll contact you.
 

 

 

57
(OVER) a distant SIREN. William hands him the gun.

PARCHER
Keep it. You may need it.

John looks down at the gun in his hand. A beat. Then he tosses it
away onto the seat of William's car.

EXT.-SHORE OF THE CHARLES-NIGHT

John watches as William’s car pulls away. Then he turns and stares
into the dark waters. Terrified and alone.

INT.-NASH’S APARTMENT-LATE

Nash ENTERS. The apartment has changed. A woman’s touch. Alicia is
sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket.

ALICIA
Baby, I was worried.

She rises, the blanket falling away to reveal a belly three months
pregnant. She rushes to her husband, wrapping her arms around him.
But he stands there, still, like a ghost.
ALICIA
Fox said you left the office hours
ago. When you didn’t call...
{pulling back)
gohn...?

He just shakes his head. Kisses her on the cheek distantly. Then he
goes into the study and closes the door.

Alicia tries the knob. Locked.

ALICIA
Baby, what is it?

No answer. She bows her forehead against the door.

ALICIA
John, please answer me. John?

But from beyond the shut portal, only silence.
INT.-NASH’S SUN PORCH-NIGHT

Alicia’s paintings rest on easels. Nash sits at his desk. A beat.
Then he buries his head in his hands and begins to cry.
 

 

58
INT. -MIT-CLASSROOM-DAY

John stands at the window, staring out at the parking row. A black
sedan pulls up. Two suspicious men in trench coats and hats emerge.

NASH-CLOSE. Really nervous.

Then two women emerge from the car, followed by their kids. Not hit
men, just two families. WIDER

John turns to face a classroom full of students, all staring at him
with confusion. His eyes are hollow as he moves to his desk.

NASH
(off booklets on his desk)
Here is the final exam I will be
giving in ten weeks. Class
participation is neither expected
nor desired. Have a nice day.

Nash walks out, leaving the group of stunned students behind.
INT.-MIT HALLWAY-AFTERNOON

Nash is walking down a corridor. (OVER) FOOTSTEPS behind him. He
turns over his shoulder. No one. Resumes walking.

Again FOOTSTEPS. He picks up his pace. So do the FOOTSTEPS.

Nash breaks into a run, down the corridor, ducking just inside an
alcove, back pressed against the wall, BREATHLESS.

The FOOTSTEPS grow LOUDER, closing until...Alicia and Zweifel turn
the corner, stop and stare at Nash.

ALICIA
What are you doing? Didn’t you hear
me calling you?

John rubs his eyes, shakes his head. He didn’t.

ALICIA
I wanted to surprise you for lunch.
Zweif said you'd be here. John...?

NASH
I’m just tired is all. Thanks,
zZweif.

Nash leads Alicia off. He doesn’t notice the look she throws over
her shoulder at Zweifel who just stands there, watching them go.
 

59
EXT.-MIT-PARCHER’S WAREHOUSE-AFTERNOON

Nash approaches the warehouse which houses William’s lab. The same
armed soldier stands at the door.

NASH
I need to see William.

GUARD
He's not on site today, sir.

NASH
When will he be back?

GUARD
I'm sorry, Professor.

A beat. Nash heads off.
INT.-MIT RAND HEADQUARTERS -HALLWAY-DUSK

The setting sun draws long shadows out the windows. Nash pulis his
office door closed. He turns, practically colliding with William.

NASH
(jumping back)
Christ.

PARCHER
You were looking for me.

Nash takes a second to gather himself.
NASH
I can't keep doing this. I’m getting
paranoid. Any time a car backfires-
PARCHER
I understand. Better than you can
- possibly imagine.
William looks away. His eyes are terribly sad.
PARCHER
Great deeds come at great cost. Your
words, John.

William puts his hands on Nash’s shoulders.
 

 

 

60

PARCHER
We're closing in on the bomb, in
large part due to your work. Isn’t
your fear a small price to pay?

NASH
You have to guarantee you can
protect me. Protect my family.

William’s tone is steely when he speaks.

PARCHER
I told you attachments were
dangerous. You chose to marry the
girl. I did nothing to prevent it.
Don't make me regret that.

NASH
What do you mean, prevent it?

William’s answer is only silence.
PARCHER

The best way to insure everyone’s
safety is to continue your work.

NASH
That’s bullshit. I'll just quit-
PARCHER
No. You won’t.
NASH

Why the hell not-
PARCHER

Because I keep the New Freedom from
becoming aware that you work for us.

Finally, John realizes William's eyes are dead.
PARCHER

If you quit working for me, I quit

working for you.
In the dying light, William turns, heads for the front door.

NASH
(shouting)
Parcher! PARCHER!

Fox emerges from his door, stares at Nash, obviously concerned.
 

ae

61

/ FOX
You okay? Who are you shouting at?

But Nash doesn’t answer, just stares after William as the door
kisses closed behind him.

INT.-NASH’S APARTMENT-SUN PORCH-LATE NIGHT
Nash sits, his back to us, in the dark, staring into space.

ALICIA (OVER)
dohn.

She flicks on the light, standing now in the doorway, a three month
eid infant swaddled in her arms.

NASH
(spinning)
Turn it off.
We see his face now, unshaven, cheeks hollow, eyes wide.
NASH
(shouting)
Turn off the light.

He is up fast, SLAMMING his hand on the wall, extinguishing the
light. His fast moves have scared the baby who has begin to WAIL.

Nash moves to the window, knocking over Alicia’s easel and half
finished painting. He hurls the canvas out the door.

NASH
I want this stuff out of here.

John raises the drawn blind a bit and peeks out.

QUT THE WINDOW. A black sedan. An identical car pulls up beside it.
A shadow inside the first car points towards John’s apartment.

A beat. John lets the shade fall again. He turns now to face his
wife and WAILING child.

NASH
_ They’re out there.

ALICIA
Who's out there?

John just stares at her. When his VOICE comes, it’s soft.
 

 

 

q

62

NASH
Go to your sister’s.

ALICZ
John, what’s going ,on? Please,
you've got to talk to me-

NASH
(exploding)
Go. Now. GET OUT!

John rises and SLAMS the door. He sits back at his desk, peer
again out the window, then hugs himself, rocking slightly.

INT.-NASH'S APARTMENT-HALLWAY-CONTINUOUS

Alicia rocks her baby in her arms, her ruined canvas at her feet.
She pauses over the phone. A beat. Then she lifts the receiver.

EXT.-HARVARD UNIVERSITY-DAY

Nash climbs the steps of the Mathematics building. His suit lcoks
slept in, his hair a wild garden. He keeps looking behind him.

Nash pauses by a sign that reads: GUEST LECTURER-COHN NASH. A beat.
He checks over his shoulder again, then heads inside.

INT.-HARVARD UNIVERSITY-MATHEMATICS BUILDING-DAY

Jchn is walking skittishly through the lobby when a small, familiar
figure runs up to greet him. Marcee.

MARCEE
Mean Uncle John, Mean Uncle John.

She raises her hands high over her head, bares her teeth and looses
a savage GROWL.

MARCEE
See, I remembered.

NASH
You sure did.

He lifts her up in his arms and hugs her, tight, eyes closing
against the smell of her small girl’s hair. Sets her down.

CHARLES
Someone really needed a hug.
(clasps John's hand)
Saw you on the slate. Couldn't miss
hearing the inimitable John Nash.
 

 

 

63
Nash’s smile is weak.

CHARLES
What is it? What’s wrong?

NASH
I’m into something. ...I need help.

CHARLES
(darkening)
What? Teli me...

John looks like he’s about to speak. Then...

VOICE (OVER)
Professor Nash...

A GRADUATE STUDENT stands at the open door to the lecture hall.
Beckoning John. Apparently his lecture is about to begin.

NASE
We’ll talk after. Okay?

Before Charles can stop him, Nash heads inside.
INT.-HARVARD-LECTURE HALL

John stands on stage, a blackboard scrawled with numbers behind
him. He is speaking, staring out into the audience.

NASH
...And so we see that conventional
number theory breaks down in the
face of relativistic exploration...

Nash's voice trails off. A couple of MEN have ENTERED at the top of
a stairway, wearing overcoats and hats.

NASH
Sometimes, our expectations are
betrayed by the numbers...

Nash's voice trails off again. Another MAN has emerged at the top
of the other stairway, also in overcoat and top hat.

NASH
Excuse me.

Nash is staring at the young Graduate Student in the front row.

NASH
Is there another way out of here?
64

 

Folks look puzzled. The Student, confused, points to a side door.

NASH
I’m sorry.

Nash turns and rushes off stage, out the side door. The audience
stares in befuddled wonder.

EXT.-HARVARD MATHEMATICS BUILDING-DAY

Nash emerges from a side door, moving fast towards the street. A
figure blocks his way. It's the lone Man from one of the stairways.

MAN
Professor Nash.

Nash stops cold in his tracks. Spins. The other two Men are
standing right behind him. Nowhere to run.

MAN
Let’s avoid a scene, shall we?

NASH
What do you want?

a rast

“ My mame is Dr. Rosen. I'm a
psychiatrist.
NASH
Right.
ROSEN

I'd like you to come with me, John.
Just for a chat.

NASH
And if I say no?

- ROSEN
I have a court order signed by a
judge. I hope we can proceed without
any unpleasantness.

John offers a charming smile.
NASH
Well I suppose I don’t have much
choice.

: He begins towards the Man, then hauls off and DECKS him, hard,
Ne across the face. Bolts towards the street.

a
 

 

 

65
The two Men are on him in a second, grabbing him, restraining him.

NASH
Get away from me. Don’t you think I
know who you are?

Rosen approaches, pulling a hypo from a case in his coat.

NASH
(shouting)
Help! Somebody, please.

Folks are watching. At the top of the steps, Charles and Marcee
have emerged. John spots them.

NASH
Charles. Help. They’re Russian
spies.

That’s when Rosen sinks the needle into his arm.
ROSEN
(gentle)
There now. All better.
Nash’s struggling begins to slow as the medication takes effect.
ROSEN
(to the crowd)
Everything's all right here.

The two Men stuff John into the back of the car as Rosen climbs in
next to the driver.

INT. -SEDAN-MOVING

Nash stares out the window at Charles coming fast down the steps,
Marcee behind him.

Nash raises his hand towards his friend, finding only window glass
between them as the car pulls away, leaving the university behind.

CUT TO:

NASH-POV. DARKNESS. Then light through the blinks of slowly opening
eyes reveal Rosen's peering face.

ROSEN
John...
 

 

66
INT. -OFFICE

Nash lays on a couch, Rosen sitting over him. Leather chairs, an
oak desk, degrees on the walls. Picture perfect.

ROSEN
John, can you hear me?

Nash blinks. Takes in Rosen. Tries to sit up. No luck. He looks
down. His hands are bound.

ROSEN
Go easy. The Thorazine takes a
little while to wear off.
(off John’s hands)

I'm sorry about the restraints.
But...

(rubs his chin)
You have a hell of a right hook.

NASH
Where am I?

ROSEN
Mclean Psychiatric Hospital.

NASH
You can cut the shrink act, okay?

ROSEN
Who do you think I am, John?

NASH
I know who you are. You work for a
group called the New Freedom.

ROSEN
I see.

NASH
- I don‘t know anything else, okay?
I’m just a code breaker. That's all.
(a beat)
What are you going to do with me?
Are you going to kill me?

ROSEN
No. I’m going to try and help you.

John nods, then he shoves Rosen onto the floor. Jumps up, tries for
the door. But he goes down, hard. His ankles have restraints around
them too.
 

 

67
John looks up from the floor. What he sees chills his bones.
Sitting on a window seat in the corner are two figures. Charles and
Marcee, staring at him expressionlessly.

NASH
Charles?

But his old friend says nothing, just sits there impassively.

NASH
Say something. Why won't you answer
me? ...What are you doing?

Rosen has stood, gone to the desk and pressed a buzzer. The door
swings open and two burly orderlies ENTER.

NASH
Oh, Charles, not you. You can’t be
one of them. Not you.
But Charles and Marcee show no expression, just sit, watching on.
NASH
(small)
Marcee?
The Orderlies pull John standing. Rage rises in him like a tide.

NASH
Answer me, Charles. Say something.

Rosen has moved in front of Nash. Stares at him a beat.

ROSEN
Who are you talking to? Tell me who
you see.
NASH
(flaring)
- You know damn well. It’s Charles.
ROSEN
Where?
NASH

(virtually hysterical)
He’s right there. With Marcee. He's
sitting right there.

Rosen stares at him a beat.
 

 

 

68

ROSEN
There's no one there, John.

Rosen nods and the Orderlies begin dragging him out.
NASH
What are you talking about? They're
right there. They’re right there.
John is growing hysterical.
NASH
What are you doing? Say something,
Damn it Charles please just say
something.

The Orderlies drag Nash into the hallway, Charles and Marcee
staring after him like the dead, unmoving, perfectly still.

EXT.-MCLEAN HOSPITAL-DAY

Lovely steepled brick buildings situated on resplendent browning
lawns. Folks wonder like ghosts. A sprawling palace of the mad.

INT.-MCLEAN HOSPITAL-DAY
John Nash sits on a cot in a cell, rocking, mumbling. PULL BACK...
INT.-MCLEAN HOSPITAL-HALLWAY

Alicia stands watching John through the window of his cell. She
turns now, eyes red, to face Rosen.

: ALICIA
What’s wrong with him?
ROSEN
John has a disease called

schizophrenia.

Alicia can’t even ask what he means, only shakes her head.

ROSEN
He's lost his ability to tell the
difference between what is real and
what is imagined.

ALICIA
The men? The ones he thinks are
following him?
 

 

 

ROSEN
Schizophrenics are often paranoid.
They see conspiracies everywhere.

ALICIA
But John’s work...I think he deals
with conspiracies.

ROSEN

Seeing conspiracies, finding hidden
codes, these are the hallmarks of
schizophrenia. But in John’s world,
these behaviors are accepted, even
encouraged. As such, his illness may
have gone untreated far longer than
is typical.

ALICIA
What do you mean? How long?

Rosen takes a minute before he speaks. Then...

ROSEN
Possibly since graduate school. At
least that's when his hallucinations
seem to have begun.

ALICIA
What are you talking about? What
hallucinations?

ROSEN
Two, so far, that I am sure of. An
imaginary roommate named Charles
Herman. Also a girl named Marcee.

Alicia looks at Rosen like he’s the crazy one.

ALICIA
Marcee is Charles’ niece. Charles
isn’t imaginary. He and John have
been best friends since Princeton.

ROSEN
Have you ever met Charles?

ROSEN
Has he ever come to dinner?

69

Rosen holds her gaze, watches her glimpse then discard the panic.
 

 

ALICIA
He’s always in town for so little
time. Lecturing.

ROSEN
Was he at your wedding?

ALICIA
He had to teach.

ROSEN
Have you ever seen a picture of him?
Have you ever spoken with him on the
phone?

ALICIA
...-This is ridiculous.

But her words carry more conviction than her eyes.

ROSEN
I contacted Princeton. According to
housing records John lived in a
single. There was no Charles Herman
in attendance when John was there.

EXT.-MCLEAN HOSPITAL-GARDENS -NIGHT-WALKING

70

Rosen and Alicia walk the tree lined paths. Over the horizon hangs

a low harvest moon, plump and yellow.

ROSEN
Charles and Marcee are fantasies.
But to John they appear as real as
you or I.

ALICIA
Doctor, there’s probably just a
records error at Princeton.

ROSEN
I was with John when he saw them.
There was no one there.

She hugs her coat tighter.

ROSEN
I believe John's world is laced with
delusions. Like dreams walking

through his waking life.
 

 

 

ALICIA
This is absurd.

ROSEN
Which is more likely, that your
husband, a mathematician with no
military training, is a government
spy fleeing renegade Russians...

ALICIA

You’re making him sound crazy-
ROSEN

...Or that he has lost his grip on

reality?

71

Alicia starts to speak. Then purses her lips, not sure what to say.

ROSEN
The only way I can help John is to
snow him the difference between what
is real and what is in his mind.

ALICIA
What John does is classified.

ROSEN
He mentioned a supervisor at RAND.
William Parcher. Maybe he can
clarify things for us. But I can’t
get to him without clearances.

Alicia stops, eyes narrowing.

ALICIA
You want me to help you get the
details of my husband’s work?

Rosen's sudden smile seems forced.
. ROSEN
John thinks I’m a russian spy. Is
that what you think?

Alicia is silent. Holds Rosen’s eyes.
ROSEN

You called me, Alicia. You knew
something was wrong.
 

 

72

ALICIA
He wasn’t sleeping. I wanted someone
to talk with him. Zweifel recommend-

ROSEN
So your Mr. Zweifel, is he part of
this conspiracy as well?

Alicia stares at him a beat. Unsure. Then...

ALICIA
This was all a mistake. He’s just
over-tired. I’ll take him home now.

ROSEN
Alicia, no one wants someone they
love to be sick.

ALICIA
What I want is my husband released.

She’s growing agitated. Rosen's smile is full of compassion.

ROSEN
John’s been given something to
sleep. Come back in the morning.
Nine AM-.

ALICIA
I’m not leaving him here.

ROSEN
He attacked me. I've committed him
Alicia. It's not up to you anymore.

She stares at him, fighting back the fear.

ROSEN
After you’ve had a good night’s
rest, if we still can't agree on
what’s best for John I’l1ll release
him into your custody.
Alicia stares at him. Nowhere to go. Finally...

ALICIA
Nine. And I want him ready to leave.

And with that she walks off. HOLD on Rosen as he watches her go.

ALICIA
I need to know what John’s been
working on.

ZWEIFEL
Alicia, you know we can’t talk-

What she does now is extraordinary. She SLAPS him across the face.

ZWEIFEL
(stunned)
it's classified-

And she SLAPS him again. Harder.

ZWEIFEL
Alicia-.

And a third swing. But this one he catches by the wrist. Looks at
Fox. Back to Alicia.

FOX
You better come inside.

INT.-MIT RAND-NASH’S OFFICE

Fox pushes open the door. The walls, ceiling and windows are
covered with scrawled magazine and newspaper clippings. The work
is, without question, bizarre, perhaps even mad.

ALICIA
Oh my God.

INT.-MIT RAND-NASH’S OFFICE-MINUTES LATER

Alicia sits with Fox and Zweifel. She is trying to hang on, her
eyes fierce, determined.

ALICIA
. Why didn’t you say something? I
mean, all this...

She gestures to the magazine papered ceiling.

ZWEIFEL
Alicia, John’s always been, well,
you know, weird.

FOX
I mean he used to ride his bicycle
in figure eights for days straight.
 

 

 

75

ZWEIFEL
But he’s a genius and in our
business, geniuses get way with it.

FOX
Especially here.

ZWEIFEL
He said he was doing code breaking.
That it was eyes only. Top secret.
Part of the military effort.

ALICIA
Was he?

Fox opens his hands before him.

FOX
It’s possible. Directives come down
all the time that some of us aren't
cleared for. It was possible.

ZWEIFEL
But not likely. Lately he seemed
more and more agitated. Then, when
you called...

ALICIA
So this is all he’s been doing every
day? Cutting up magazines.
Fox and Zweifel exchange a look.

FOX
Not exactly all.

EXT.-MIT RAND COMPOUND-WALKING-DAY
Nash, Alicia and Fox are walking the row of abandoned warehouses.

- FOX
He keeps coming down here.

ZWEIFEL
We figured he was thinking.

FOX
He used to do that a lot at school.
Just thinking.
 

76

ZWEIFEL
He'd go inside. You’d hear him sort
of...talking to himself.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

The threé of them face the warehouse that housed William’s secret
lab. No fresh coat of paint. No new windows. No guard at the gate.

Alicia climbs the steps, pushes open the door.

INT. -WAREHOUSE-DAY

«

No secret lab. No personnel. Just sunlight painting the columns of
dust through the windows. No one has been here in a very long time.
PULL BACK as Alicia stands alone in the giant, empty space.

ALICIA

(turning)
I need John’s supervisor. I need to
talk to William Parcher.

FOX-CLOSE. His frown is inscrutable.
EXT. -MCLEAN-GARDENS -MORNING-WALKING

Crisp. Sunny. John and Rosen walk, John’s hands bound before him.
A burly ORDERLY paces them, a few feet behind. Patients mill.

ROSEN
You seem calmer this morning, John.

NASH
Well it seems obvious by now that
you're not going to kill me. You can
imagine that’s a load off my mind.

Rosen can’t help but smile.

ROSEN
° You still think I'm a Russian spy?
NASH
You still want to pretend you're
not?
ROSEN

You are a rational man. Let me
appeal to your rationality. Why do
you think I didn’t see Charles and
Marcee in my office?
 

 

77

NASH
I think you did see them. I think
this is all some kind of attempt to
brainwash me.

, ROSEN
And why would I want to do that?
NASH
To break me. To find out what I

know.
Rosen nods. He doesn’t seem surprised.

ROSEN
So Charles and Marcee, they are part
of this conspiracy too?

NASH
You must have recruited him. Maybe
you threatened Marcee.

ROSEN
And your wife. She phoned me. Is she
part of this as well?

John stumbles a beat. Then recovers.

NASH
My behavior must have seemed erratic
to her. She’s confused.

ROSEN
Is she, John? Or is it possible that
you're confused?

Rosen motions across the courtyard. A white haired man stands in a
corner, gesturing angrily, TALKING to thin air.

- ROSEN (OVER)
For years people have referred to
madness as being without reason. But
that isn’t true. That fellow is as
reasonable as you or I.

The white haired man begins to plead and SHOUT.

ROSEN (OVER)
We simply cannot see his reason. We
cannot see the invisible adversary
who makes him so angry. But he can,
as clear as he sees you or I.
 

78

 

Rosen stops, puts his hand on John’s arm.

ROSEN
Look back on the times with Charles
and Marcee.

NASH
I won't play this game with you.

ROSEN
Is it possible that, like him, you
were really alone?

NASH
I won't indulge this.

ROSEN
John, insulin shock has been known
to reduce schizophrenic delusions.

John stops, anger flashing in his eyes.

NASH
The other shoe falls. What do you
want to give me? Sodium pentothal?

— ROSEN
Just insula-

John knocks Rosen’s hand away with his bound wrists. Despite his
spiking temper, John seems almost relieved.

NASH
Spacebo, Comrade Rosen. I told you,
I don’t know anything. I’m just a
code breaker.
(voice rising)

But if this means an end to this
goddamned charade, then come on.
Drug me.

The Orderly has moved in. John spins to face the man.

NASH
Come on!

But Rosen stops the Orderly with a gesture. Turns to face Nash.

ROSEN
John, treatment only works if you
fi want to get well. I won’t give you
‘ the medication until you ask for it.
 

 

 

79
This turn seems to throw John. His expression darkens.

NASH
This is insane.

Rosen’s expression is sad.

ROSEN
Yes, John. I’m afraid it is.

EXT.-CAMBRIDGE STREET-DAY

Alicia is walking up a familiar street. She stops, looks up.
REVERSE ANGLE...

EXT.-CAMBRIDGE STREET-MANSION-DAY

The same house we’ve seen before. And terribly different. Broken
windows. Dilapidated side boards. Long ago deserted.

Alicia walks to the front gate. The remains of an aging lock pad
hangs by wires. Broken. She pushes the gate, CREAKING, open.

EXT.-CAMBRIDGE MANSION-DAY
An old mailbox sits ahead. A rusting pad lock hangs at its base.

Alicia looks up at the empty house. Then she lifts a large rock and
begins HAMMERING away at the lock, face set with determination.

INT.-MCLEAN-NASH’S CELL-DAY

Nash sits alone in his cell. Spread out before him are documents
from Princeton. His housing form. A class list.

HOLD on John as he stares at the documentation. A beat. Is that a
crack in his resolve?

Then he wipes the materials onto the floor, angry. Draws his knees
up to his chin and sits, face fixed once again with determination.

INT.-MCLEAN-COMMON ROOM-EVENING

Alicia sits alone, uncomfortable. Other patients occupy other
tables. Many wear the vacant stares of the damned. Alicia’s eyes go
to an opening door.

John ENTERS, escorted by two Orderlies. He sits at the long table
across from her. The Orderlies retire to a table not far off.

Alicia reaches across and takes his hands, holds them in hers. The
pain on her face is palpable.
 

a

 

Folks in the room stare. Nash sits back,
herself. Takes a breath.

ALICIA
John, I’m so sorry.

NASH
(nodding)
At first, I thought you were one of
them. But I’ve been thinking about
it. They used you, Alicia. Of course
I must have looked mad to you.

ALICIA
I was so worried.

NASH
It’s going to be all right. But we
have to speak quietly. They may be
listening. There may be microphones.

Alicia bites her lip, tries not to react.

NASE
I’m going to tell you everything,
now. I’m breaking protocol. But
you've got to know. You’ve got to
help me get out of here.

John rubs his wrist.

NASH
Damn implant.
(a beat)

I've been doing top secret work for
the government. There’s a threat of
catastrophic proportions. I think
the Reds must think I’m too high
profile to simply do away with. So
they’re trying to keep me here. So I
can’t do my work.

Alicia is staring at him, fighting back the tears.

NASH
Go to RAND. You’ve got to get in
touch with William Parcher. He can-

ALICIA
(too loud)
Stop! Just stop!

B80

stunned. Alicia gathers
 

81

ALICIA
John, I've been to RAND. There is no
William Parcher.

NASH .
Of course there is. I’ve been
working for him. I‘ve been-

ALICIA
What, John? Breaking codes? Dropping
them in a secret mailbox for the
government to pick up.

NASH
How could you...?

ALICIA
Fox followed you one night. He
thought it was harmless. Loyal Fox.

Rlicia has reached into her bag. Lifts something onto the table.

ALICIA
None of its been real, John.

And with that, she deposits on the table a stack of gray RAND
envelopes. All still sealed with John’s seal.

ALICIA
They’ve never been opened.

John tears one open. Inside, his pages of code. His marked maps.
Never picked up. Never seen by anyone.

ALICIA
There is no William. There is no
conspiracy. It’s all in your mind.
You're sick, John. Don’t you
understand, you’re sick.

Alicia begins to cry, the tears coming now, streaming down her
cheeks. Finally she bows to John’s hand on the table, pressing her
cheek to the back of his palm, body racked with trembling SOBS.

HOLD on John as he looks from his weeping wife to his work. He
lifts a torn magazine page, marked and scrawled.

HOLD on John. On his face, for the first time, fear.
INT.-MCLEAN-ROSEN’S OFFICE-NIGHT

Rosen sits over his desk. The door opens and a NURSE ENTERS.
 

82

NURSE
Doctor. It’s Nash. Code red.

Rosen is up fast.
INT.-MCLEAN-NASH’S CELL-NIGHT

Rosen UNLOCKS Nash’s cell and ENTERS to find Nash, his back to the
door, standing in a pool of blood.

ROSEN
John?

Nash turns, holding his wrist in his hand. Blood is spilling
through his fingers.

As Rosen gently takes John’s hand he notices a brad from under the
mattress frame, torn free and bloody on the floor.

NASH
There's nothing there.

The flesh on top of John’s wrist has been gouged away, almost to
the bone. The Nurse hands Rosen a wad of gauze. Rosen begins to
dress the wound. John is crying.

NASH
There’s no implant. There’s nothing
there.

INT. -MCLEAN-TREATMENT ROOM-DAY

Small. A single gurney sits in the middle of the floor. A NURSE
stands by a silver medical table.

The door opens. Nash shuffles in wearing hospital clothes and paper
slippers. He sits on the gurney. Draws up his legs and arms.

INT. -MCLEAN-OBSERVATION ROOM-DAY
Rosen and Alicia watch through a plexi window.

ROSEN
This, right now, is the final
nightmare of schizophrenia. The
horror of not knowing what is true,
what is real and what isn’t.

Leather restraints are pulled tight around his wrists and ankles,
his forehead.
 

83
ROSEN
Imagine if you suddenly learned that
the people, the places, the moments

most important to you were not gone,
not dead, no, worse, had never been.

The Nurse places a plastic bit in his mouth. Lifts the hypo.

ROSEN
What kind of hell would that be?

Alicia touches the divide as the Nurse swabs John’s arm, locks to
Rosen for the nod. She puts needle to flesh. Alicia turns away.

INT, -TREATMENT ROOM

See Nash as his body arches into the agony of insulin shock, eyes
rolling up, SCREAMING through the bit as we PULL BACK AND UP...

EXT.-MCLEAN-HIGH ANGLE
(OVER) Nash’s GROWLED SCREAM. We continue up, higher and higher,
Mclean disappearing in the first falling storm of snow until the
world is a wash of white...

DISSOLVE TO:
WHITE CHERRY BLOSSOMS-CLOSE. PULL BACK TO REVEAL...
EXT. - LAWN- PRINCETON-SPRING

Rows and rows of cherry trees, blowing in the breeze. Alicia and
Fox walk away from us along the bank of a brook.

ALICIA
Two a week. For six months. The
treatments were...difficult.

REVERSE ANGLE. Alicia seems older. It’s her eyes.

FOX
But he’s better?

ALICIA
He’s in remission.

Fox's eyes ask the question.

ALICIA
(reciting)
Schizophrenia has no cure. But with
medication and a low stress
environment the patient can hope to
approximate a normal life.

Fox just nods. They continue on. A lovely white colonial is visible
in the distance.

ALICIA
The doctor thought a change of
scenery. Somewhere peaceful. After
RAND terminated his contract-

FOX
zZweifel and I tried to-

Alicia stills him with a casual wave of her hand. She has about her
the odd self-possession that comes with close proximity to madness.

She looks off,

ALICIA
You can’t very well have a madman
keeping government secrets, can you?

gaze going well past the visible horizon.
ALICIA

You'd be surprised how many people
don’t want crazy in their lives.

Fox wants to speak, he just doesn’t know what to say.

ALICIA
John always spoke so fondly of
Princeton. I thought, maybe being
here, near familiar surroundings...

FOX
Alicia, how are you?

ALICIA

The delusions have passed.’ I see
pictures of the Jews from Europe.
They have this look in their eyes.
Hard and stunned at the same time.
Like they’re trying to find an
entire world that’s been stolen out
from under them. That’s John too, I
think. Lost.
 

E

There is definitely about her an odd feeling, both strong and
fragile, like giant plates of shifting ice.

 

FOX
No, Alicia. How are you?

For a moment she seems not to be able to even understand the
question. Then...

ALICIA
You know Heisenberg’s uncertainty
principle?
FOX
(puzzled)

The properties of the object are
influenced by the observer.

ALICIA

(nodding)
Often what I feel is obligation, or
guilt over wanting to leave, or
rage, against John, against God. But
then I look at him and I force
myself to see the man I married. And
he becomes that man. He's
ae, transformed into someone I love. And
then I'm transformed into someone
who loves him. It’s not all the

time. But it’s enough.

Fox walks on, amazed at this woman.

FOX
John is a lucky man.

ALICIA
And so unlucky.

EXT.-NASH HOUSE-PRINCETON-DAY

Nash sits on the porch swing, staring at a pad of equations, pen in
hand. Fox climbs the porch steps.

FOX
Hey, Chief.

Nash looks up. He seems pale, drawn, as if part of him has gone
missing, been replaced by shadow.

NASH
Finally. A little respect.

86

Nash gestures to an empty porch swing.

NASH

Have you said hello to Harvey?
FOX

John, I-
NASH

Relax. What good's being nuts if you
can‘t have a little fun?

FOX
Jesus, John.

Alicia appears and hands John two red pills and a glass of water.
She kisses him on the head and leaves them again.

NASH
Well, I must say it’s nice to know
you were real.

He swallows the pills, takes a long drink.

FOX
Zweifel wanted to come but...

NASH
Squeamish?
(off Fox’s shrug)
I suppose I would be too. But alas,
I'm stuck with me.

FOX
Ah, I know that feeling.

Nash actuaily smiles.
FOX
- Have you been to. campus? Milnor’s
running the math department.
NASH
God, don’t tell him what happened to
me. He‘ll have finally won.
Fox gives a sad smile.

FOX
I’ve missed you, John.

Nash seems sincerely puzzled.
 

 

 

87

NASH
Why?

Fox finds his answer blocked by a lump in his throat, looks away.

NASH
I've been working on solving the
Riemann Hypothesis...

Nash slides his pad over to Fox.

NASH
If I dazzle them, they’1l have to
reinstate me. But the medication
makes me blurry.

Fox's smile tries to hide the fact that Nash’s calculations don’t
seem to make much sense. He slides back the pad.

FOX
There are other things beside work.

John stares at him.

NASH
What are they?
{taps his temple)
This is who I was.

INT.-NASH HOUSE-KITCHEN-NIGHT

Alicia is doing the dishes. John stands staring at the kitchen
table. He lifts a napkin, toys with it curiously, like an alien
come to Earth for the first time.

ALICIA
(turning off the tap)
Is everything all right, John?

NASE
What do people do?

By Alicia’s expression, this question is not coming for the first
time. But she rallies herself again for the answer.

ALICIA
This. Just this.

(smiles)
No conspiracies. No earth shattering
discoveries. Just this.
 

 

88

NASH

Everything is so meaningless.
ALICIA

It’s life, John. Activities

available. Just add meaning.
John nods, but by his expression, he surely doesn’t understand.

NASH
What do I do now?

ALICIA
You could take out the garbage.

NASH
(smiles)
World famous mathematician turned
schizophrenic takes out trash. Now
that’s something.

ALICIA
There you go. Onward and upward.

He lifts the trash bag, walks out the kitchen door. Alicia begins
putting the dishes away. (OVER) We hear Nash TALKING.

ALICIA-CLOSE. Terrified. She spins as John re-enters.

ALICIA
Who were you talking to?

NASH
The garbage man.

ALICIA
Garbage men don’t come at night.

NASH
I guess here they do.

Alicia stares at him. Unsure. Then a figure passes the window. A
garbage man after all, throwing the bag into a truck HISSING past.

ALICIA
John, I’m-

He takes her in his arms. She folds into nis chest. Normal life has
become a mine field.

aH
 

 

89
NASH
It’s all right. Everything’s going
to be all right.
But by his expression, he seems anytning but sure.

INT. -SUN "PORCH-DAY

Nash sits over his pad. He stares out the picture window. Then
tries to write. Stares at the line of equations. Gibberish.

Nash presses his pencil into the paper, crushing through the lead,
Zinally SNAPPING the hilt.

INT.-NASH BEDROOM-NIGHT

John lays on his back, Alicia curled beside him. Spring moonlight
pours in through the open window.

Alicia kisses his neck tentatively, then his face. John lies still
as a statue. He tilts his head away, strokes her head platonically.

NASH
I'm sorry. The medication...

Alicia surrenders, sliding back down and laying on his chest. HOLD
on her face, sad eyes open in the moonlight.

INT.-NASH LIVING ROOM-AFTERNOON

John stands. with his SCREAMING baby in his arms. He seems entirely
unsure how to handle this unwieldy little human.

Alicia comes in from the kitchen. She SLAMS John’s medication and
water glass on the table.

Then she scoops up her child in one hand, retrieves the fallen
pacifier from the floor with the other.

She feeds their son the binky, the child’s CRIES instantly stilled.

Alicia exits with the baby. John stands in the middle of the room,
sad, helpless. No good at real life. He stares down at his pills.

INT.-NASH KITCHEN-SUNSET

Alicia stands staring into the mirror. She begins fixing her hair,
finding several streaks of premature grey.

Her fingers drift down to her cheek, trace the lines there. HOLD on
her as she stares at her expression, one suddenly so very old.
 

90

 

A beat. Then she pulls the mirror off the wall, throwing it,
SHATTERING to the floor.

Alicia leans back, sliding down now against the wall, knees coming
up to her chin as she begins to CRY.

EXT.-NASH HOUSE-NIGHT

John is pouring the shards of the mirror off an impromptu cardboard
dustpan into the trash can. He turns, heads back into...

INT. -KITCHEN-NIGHT

Alicia is setting his medication and water on the table. She looks
worse than she ever has. Eyes dark and hollow. What a toll, this.

NASH
Alicia-.

ALICIA
You're not the only one who gets to
go crazy around here, you know.

(brave)
I’m fine.
a, She lying and they both know it.
ALICIA

I’m going to bed.
(off his pills)
Eat up.

ohn smiles. Then he nods. She kisses his head, goes out the door.

ay

INT.-NASH HOUSE-SUN PORCH-NIGHT

Glass enclosed. Moonlight beams in through the large windows,
illuminating the dark forest beyond the lawn.

John sits at his desk, staring at the pills and water before him.
A beat. Theri he opens a drawer.

INSIDE THE DRAWER. Maybe five days worth of his pills. Not taken.
John drops the two new tablets inside. Closes the drawer.

Nash looks at his desk. Piles of unopened mail. Several math
journals. He notices a New York Times. He opens the paper.

NASH-POV. Columns of articles. Suddenly the text goes black,
characters rising into the air in a perfectly revealed pattern.

(OVER) A RAP as something hits the window. Hard.

 
gL

 

John peers out into the night. Someone, a silhouette, darts across
the lawn, John is up, fast, moving into the hallway.

EXT.-NASH HOUSE-NIGHT-CONTINUOUS
Nash shoves open the screen door, stares out into the night.

NASH
Who's there? Hello?

(OVER) CRICKETS. A figure bolts across the green, little more than
a shadow, racing towards the tree line and then gone.

NASH
Hey!

Nash takes off in a sprint after the fleeing specter.
EXT.-NASH HOUSE-NIGHT

The figure disappears into the dark tree line, Nash racing fast
across the lawn in close pursuit, bursting now, into...

EXT.-NASH EOUSE-FOREST-NIGHT
Nash continues running through the trees, slowing now, finally

coming to a stop deep in the dark forest. He looks around.
Moonlight. Night bird CRIES. But no sign of the mysterious figure.

 

(OVER) A RUSTLING. Nash spins to his left, a shadow darting from
tree to tree, there, then gone into the darkness.

NASH
Hello?

(OVER) ANOTHER RUSTLING. Nash spins to his right to glimpse another
darting shadow, vanishing into the night.

NASH
Who’s there?

That’s when John is grabbed from behind. His arms are pulled
backwards in restraint as a figure steps out of the darkness.

Hat and trench coat make him little more than an elegant shadow. As
he approaches, his face becomes visible in the moonlight...

NASH
Parcher.

PARCHER
It’s good to see you, John.

 

 
 

92

William nods and the MAN behind Nash releases him. As the stranger
steps into the moonlight we see he is a U.S. soldier.

PARCHER
What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?

NASH
(finally)
You're not real.

William wraps his arm around Nash.
PARCHER
Don’t be ridiculous. Of course I am.
Let’s take a walk.
He begins leading Nash deeper into the forest.
INT.-NASH HOUSE-NIGHT

Alicia lies in bed, her sleep fitful, moving under the covers. A
small MOAN escapes her lips, victim to dark dreams.

EXT. -FOREST-NIGHT

William and his guard have led John to an old tool shed on the edge
of the property.

PARCHER
The bomb is armed and stationary.

William has walked to the front door.

PARCHER
Knowing your situation requires you
keep a low profile, Mohammed. We
brought the mountain to you.

William pulls open the door, the night flooded with sudden white
light. William bows and gestures with his arm, ushering him inside.

INT.-TOOL SHED-NIGHT

Bright. Men in lab coats move back and forth in front of high-tech
decoding equipment. William leads Nash to a giant, lit map board.

PARCHER
We have narrowed the location of the
bomb to the Eastern seaboard. But
we're stumped. Their codes have
grown increasingly complex....
 

 

f
Se

John stares at him.

PARCHER
What?

NASH
You're hallucinations. Products of
my imagination. Dr. Rosen said...

PARCHER
Rosen? That quack? Schizophrenic
break from reality, right? Inability
to tell what is real from what is
imagined? Psychological bullshit. Do
I look imagined to you?

NASH
RAND has no record of you...

PARCHER
Do you think we list our personnel?

John just stares at him.

PARCHER
I’m sorry you had to go through
this. Your stay at Mclean must have
been...disorienting. Your wife meant
well, I’m sure. Your actions must
have looked quite bizarre to her. We
had no idea she’d go ahead and have
you institutionalized. But once she
did.... You were calling attention
to yourself. I thought it best you
stay put until the scrutiny passed.

NASH
But Charles and Marcee....

PARCHER

After your lecture, our operatives
approached Charles. We needed
someone to keep an eye on you.
Someone you would trust. He’s turned
out to be quite good, actually. If
only he didn’t insist on carting
that child around everywhere.

93

William nods and two figures emerge from the shadows. Charles, and
behind him, Marcee.
 

 

94

MARCEE
Uncle John, Uncle John.

She races to him and leaps into his arms. He holds her so tight.

MARCEE
You're gonna squeeze me ‘till I pop.

John reluctantly sets her down, his expression darkening.

NASH
At the hospital. Why couldn’t Rosen
see you?
PARCHER

I can explain everything. But I need
you to trust me.

HOLD on John a beat as he stares at William.

PARCHER
I’ve gone to great trouble te get
you back. Now, make me owe you. I
can restore your status at RAND. I
can tell the world what you did...

William walks right up to him, stares into his eyes.

PARCHER
I need you now, soldier. We all do.

John looks at Charles. At little Marcee. Finally...

NASH
I was so scared you weren’t real.

PARCHER
We can’t afford a repeat of last
year. Your wife can’t know.

- NASH
I have to tell her. She thinks I‘m-

PARCHER
We'd be putting her at risk. It's
for her own protection. Hers and
that brand new boy of yours.

William extends his grasp. Nash stares a beat. He takes his hand.

PARCHER
Welcome back.

INT.-NASH BEDROOM-NIGHT

Alicia lies asleep. John stands over her, staring. Then he turns.
William is standing in the door way. John heads towards him.

EXT.-NASH HOUSE-NIGHT .
Nash crosses the dark lawn,. into the forest.
INT.-NASH HOUSE-TOOL SHED-NIGHT-MOS

Nash stands amidst the high tech machinery, before a light board
covered with maps and code, lecturing to a team of analysts.

INT.-NASH HOUSE-FRONT HALL-DAY
Nash is carrying the baby upstairs as Alicia heads outside.

ALICIA
There’s a storm coming.

NASH
I‘1l draw his bath.

Her concern flashes for only a second. But he registers it anyway.
NASH
I’m his father, Alicia.
(softening)
Ie’ll be okay.

Alicia's forced smile is full of hope for truth in his words. She
heads outside.

EXT.-NASH HOUSE-DAY

Storm clouds are assembling on the horizon. Dark. The wind is
fierce. Alicia gathers blanket and toys. (OVER) A BANGING from the
woods just beyond the house.

Alicia looks up at the SOUND, puzzled. A beat. Then she leaves the
detritus on the lawn, begins heading towards the BANGING.

EXT. -FOREST-DAY

Alicia walks through the trees. In just minutes the sky has grown
darker. The wind has picked up, MOANING now.

(OVER) The BANGING has increased in both tempo and volume. She

It begins to rain, the sky pelting her with big, heavy drops.
Alicia approaches the shack. She pulls the door open.

ALICIA-CLOSE. Face broken with horror. PULL BACK TO REVEAL...

The entire shed, walls, floor and ceiling are covered with scrawled
newspaper and magazine clippings, the hallmarks of John’s madness.

EXT.-LAWN-HIGH ANGLE-STORM

See Alicia, tiny from this height, racing across the lawn towards
the house. Lightening. (OVER) The dull THUD of distant thunder.

INT.-NASH EOUSE-STORM

Alicia pushes inside. Looks in the living room. No sign of John.
(OVER) From upstairs the sound of WATER RUNNING.

ALICIA
No.

INT.-NASH HOUSE-STAIRWAY-CONTINUOUS

Alicia is racing up the stairs. (OVER) The sound of RUNNING WATER

Alicia bursts into the bedroom in time to see Nash struggling to
close a window. The baby is nowhere in sight. (OVER) The sound of
RUNNING WATER is loud from the bathroom.

NASH
(back turned)
I've almost got it. Charles, hold
. the baby up. Make sure he doesn’t
slip into the bath...

FOLLOW Alicia as she rushes into the room, past John’s startled
expression, and freezes in the open bathroom door.

ALICIA
No!
 

 

 

97
INT.-NASH BATHROOM-CONTINUOUS

The baby is in the tub. Alone. The water is almost up to his chin,
seconds from drowning. Alicia moves with lightning speed, grabbing
her child up and into her arms.

ALICIA
Precious baby, precious boy.

She clutches him for dear life. Spins to face John who’s standing
there, eyes wide with panic.

NASH
Charles was watching him. He was
okay. Charles was watching him.

INT.-STAIRWAY-SECONDS LATER

Alicia is moving down the stairs, fast, baby in her arms. Nash is
chasing after her.

ALICIA
How long, John? How long have you
been lying to me?

NASH
You don’t understand. It's for your
protection. The work is top secret.

ALICIA
Don‘t you get it yet? There’s no one
here.

NASH

They’ve been injected with a
cloaking serum. It’s part of the war
against the conspiracy. I see them
because of a chemical that entered
my bloodstream when my implant
dissolved....

John’s VOICE trails off. Alicia has spun around, is staring at him.

ALICIA
Don’t you even hear how you sound?

NASH
I’m not crazy. It’s all real.

Alicia starts moving again, John following her into...
 

 

INT.-LIVING ROOM-CONTINUOUS
Alicia lifts the phone.

ALICIA
I’m calling Rosen. You need help.

That’s when William steps into the doorway.

PARCHER
You've got to stop her, John.
NASH
What?
ALICIA

(blood draining)
Who are you talking to?

PARCHER
We can’t afford to let her slow us
down again.

NASH
Alicia, please. Put the phone down.

ALICIA
John, you’re scaring me.

PARCHER
You'll go back to the hospital.
Countless people will die.
William takes a step into the room.

PARCHER
I can’t let that happen.

38

Alicia has begun dialing the phone. Hands unsteady, trembling lips

finding the- numbers.

PARCHER
Great deeds.

William unbuttons his jacket, revealing his holster.

PARCHER
Great cost.

ALICIA
(into the phone)
I need to speak to Dr. Rosen-

 
 

 

 

99
William reaches for his weapon. His eyes are sad.

PARCHER
I’m sorry, John.

NASH
No!

John SLAPS the receiver out of Alicia’s hand, sending the phone
SMASHING against the wall.

Alicia steps back against the wall. John stands facing her. The
baby WAILS in her arms. When her voice finally comes, its WHISPER.

ALICIA
Get away from me.
NASH
Alicia-
ALICIA
(screaming)
GET AWAY!

John takes a step back from the force of her VOICE, and she’s out,
pushing past him into...

INT.-NASH HOMSE-HALLWAY- CONTINUOUS

She's grabbed her bag, heading for the door. She spins to face John
who just stands in the hallway, watching.

ALICIA
You want it to be real. Your secret
life is more exciting. You think I
don't know that? But this is all
there is, John. Me. Your baby. This
house. Just this.

- NASH
Blicia-

ALICIA
Can you find one reason that this
all doesn’t make sense? Can you find
one reason not to believe in them?
To believe in us instead?

John starts to speak. But no words come.

ALICIA
I love you. But that’s nowhere near
enough any more.
And with that, she pushes out the front door into the pouring rain.
EXT.-NASH HOUSE-HIGH ANGLE-STORM-CONTINUOUS

John stands in the open doorway, watching his wife disappear down
the walkway in the pouring rain towards their car.

INT.-NASH HOUSE-HALLWAY-CONTINUOUS

John stands staring outside.

William steps into the doorway behind him. Watching.
Another figure begins descending the steps. Charles.
A third tiny form tugs his hand. Marcee.

The front door SLAMS closed in the wind. PULL BACK AND UP to see
Nash there, alone in the house with his ghosts.

EXT.-NASH DRIVEWAY-STORM

It’s pouring. Alicia is putting the baby in the passenger seat. A
hand touches her shoulder. She spins to face her husband.

NASH
She never gets old.

His lips are shaking, mixing with the rain now, his falling tears.
NASH

Marcee can’t be real. She never gets

old.
The two just stand there staring at each other in the pouring rain.
EXT.-NASH HOUSE-PRINCETON-LATE AFTERNOON
The storm has broken. Crimson light stains the old colonial.
EXT.-NASH HOUSE-PORCH-LATE AFTERNOON

Nash faces a familiar figure across the porch. Dr. Rosen.

ROSEN
Do you see them now?

Nash manages a brave smile.
 

iol

 

NASH
Yes.

REVERSE ANGLE. Marcee sits on the porch playing Jacks. Charles
stands in the doorway, shaking his head disapprovingly.

ROSEN
Why did you stop your meds, John?

NASH
I couldn’t work. I couldn’t help
with the baby. I couldn’t touch her.
(a beat)
Is that better than being crazy?

ROSEN
We'll try a higher run of insulin
shocks. Then a new med-

NASH
There has to be another way.

ROSEN
The disease is degenerative. You're
- getting worse...
S

Nash looks again at Marcee.
ROSEN
Without treatment, the fantasies may
take over entirely.

NASH
Please. I can’t go back there.

ROSEN
I’m sorry, John. You have to.

INT.-NASH BEDROOM-EVENING

PAN ACROSS open dresser drawers, a suitcase half packed on the
floor, FIND Nash sitting on the bed, holding a closed book between
his palms, staring into space.

ALICIA (OVER)
Almost ready?

Alicia stands in the doorway, her expression brave.

ALICIA
Rosen’s waiting outside.

 
 

102

 

Nash looks up to his wife, his smile sad enough to snap your heart.

NASH
I can’t.
(simple truth)
I won’t survive it.

ALICIA
He said you might say.... He has
commitment papers for me to sign.

Nash nods, so terribly tired. What he expected.

NASH
This is just a problem. I have to
find the solution. It’s what I do...

She steps towards him but he stops her with a gesture. Only as he
looks up do we really see the toll this is taking on him.

NASH
Maybe you won’t sign them. Maybe
you'll give me some time to try and
figure this out.

Co He rubs the book in his hand.

NASH
But whatever you do, I think Rosen’s
right about one thing. You shouldn’t
be here. I‘m not so safe anymore.

Alicia stands in the doorway. Staring at her husband.

ALICIA
Would you have hurt me, John?

A figure races past behind her, like a ghost, startlingly fast,
then gone. He looks up at his wife.
. NASH
I don’t know.

Nash has to look away. How else to blink back the water brimming in
his eyes? When he looks up, she is gone.

. HOLD on Nash as he lets his head fall into his hands, palms taking
the weight of his defeat. PUSH IN on this single figure. Alone.

BLICIA (OVER)
Rosen said to call if you try to
kill me or anything.

 
 

 

 

103

REVERSE. Alicia ENTERS. Offers a wry smile as John stands. (OVER)
An ENGINE starts, FADES away.

ALICIA
I don’t think he thinks this is a
very good idea.

Nash’s stares at her, confused. She takes the book from him, turns
it over in her hands.

ALICIA
You’re not the only genius in the
family, you know?

She walks to him, their faces close, her voice coming quiet.

ALICIA
In sickness and in health...

She takes a rose embroidered handkerchief, wipes the tears now
spilling from his eyes. :

NASH
Alicia-

ALICIA
Don’t. I’m scared and I need you to
tell me everything’s okay and you’re
awful with words so just don’t.

What he does, he reaches out and takes her in his arms, holding
fast, holding on to her for dear life.

DISSOLVE TO:
INT. -STUDY-NIGHT-DAWN

Nash and Alicia sit on the floor reading amidst a sea of books.
Outside the window, orange and red streaks rake away the stars.

ALICIA
(glancing up)
It looks like a dream.

Nash MURMURS. Then he looks up at her, brow furrowing.

NASH
What?

ALICIA
The sky. It looks like-
 

 

 

NASH
Rosen said dreams are walking
through my waking life....

John closes his book.

NASH
What’s the difference? Between life
and a dream?

Alicia takes a beat, considering. Then...

ALICIA
Life feels more real-

NASH
How? Be specific-

ALICIA
...Emotion.
(a beat, nods)
I can't feel my Greams as deeply as
I feel the people in my life.

NASH
But I don’t do people well. I don’t
relate to them. My greatest

connections have always been...
Nash taps his head.

NASH
Need a mathematical solution, my
mind creates one. Need a best
friend, an important career, my mind
creates those too...

ALICIA
Are you saying that’s why you're
sick or because your sick?

But Nash isn’t listening.

NASH
What if I buried myself in people?
In places? In the every day? Sank
myself into reality. Wouldn’t real
life elbow out the ghosts? Wouldn't
the dreams fade? Wouldn’t I wake up?

104
 

 

 

105

ALICIA
John, this is all just theory. No
one just wills away schizophrenia.

NASH
Why not?
ALICIA
It’s not math. You can’t think your
way-
NASH
No. Not think. ...Feel.

(taps his head)
No more life of the mind...
(pats his heart)
I have to live a life of the heart.
Alicia stares at him, equal parts confusion and concern.
EXT.-PRINCETON UNIVERSITY-MORNING
Fall. Through swirls of falling color, students move across the
common. The clothes may be different, but it’s the same Princeton
Nash entered so many years ago as a Freshman. PUSH IN TO FIND...
EXT.-FINE HALL-DAY

Nash stands before the steps to the building. Takes a step towards
it, then a step back, repeats the tiny dance of indecision.

He stops, takes something out of his pocket. Alicia’s rose
embroidered handkerchief.

Holding it tight like a talisman, he heads up the steps and inside.

INT.-MATH DEPARTMENT-OFFICE

A fellow sits, head bent over a desk, his face not yet visible to

us. (OVER) A KNOCK.

MAN (OVER)
Come.

Nash ENTERS, stands in the doorway.

NASH
Hello, Martin.

The fellow looks up, familiar face going from confusion to shock.
It’s Milnor.
106

 

 

MILNOR
Jesus Christ.

NASH
No. I don’t have that one. My savior
complex took a different form.

Milnor just stares, his expression almost impossible to decode.

MILNOR
John...

Then he stands, comes around the desk, and does something almost
unimaginable, he wraps his arms around Nash and holds him.

NASH-CLOSE. So stunned he has to blink back the tears. Milnor
finally steps away, holds his shoulders at arms length.

MILNOR
I heard what happened. I wanted to
write. I tried Mclean but you had

left and I just... God, how are you?
NASH
Nutty as a fruitcake. And you?
we
— MILNOR

Look. Look here.

Milnor pulls John to his book shelves. There, beneath medals and
prizes are pictures of Nash, Milnor, Fox, Zweifel and Shapely.
Young, full of hope for the future.

MILNOR
God, de you remember us?

NASH
(off the medals)
You won after all.

MILNOR
They were wrong, John. No one wins.
You heard about Shapely?

Nash shakes his head.
MILNOR

Lung cancer. Last year. All those
damn cigarettes. Thought you knew.

Nash just shakes his head. He didn’t.
 

 

 

 

107

MILNOR
Sit down. Please.

Nash does. Milnor returns behind his desk.

\MILNOR |
I’m so glad to see you. What brings
you back to Princeton?

CHARLES (OVER)
Tell him you’re a genius-

Nash spins over his shoulder to see Charles in the open doorway.

CHARLES
Tell him you’re mission-

John reaches around in his chair and SLAMS the door in Charles’
face. Turns back to face Milnor, who stares a beat. Then smiles.

MILNOR
You were saying?

NASH
You‘re going to ignore what I just
did?

MILNOR
What are old friends for?

NASH
Is that what we are? Friends?

MILNOR
Of course. We always have been.

A beat. Then John just shakes his head.

NASH
I think being a part of a community
- would do me good. I know it’s a lot
to ask. And now that I’m here it
occurs to me you'll probably say no.
But I was wondering, could I kind of
hang around?

Milnor stares at him across the desk, this arch rival, this old
friend. It is a moment before he speaks. Then...

MILNOR
Will you be needing an office?
 

 

 

108

EXT.-PRINCETON GAMES QUAD-DAY

Two students at a games table play Nash on a triangular board. One
keeps glancing over his shoulder nervously.

WIDER. Standing behind him is Nash in his baggy suit. Rocking on
his heals the way he does, he looks like a madman.

NASH
(stepping forward)
You might try protecting your-

STUDENT
Take a hike, hun weirdo.

NASH-CLOSE. Taken aback. A beat. HOLD on Nash standing alone.
INT.-FINE HALL-HALLWAY-AFTERNOON-WALKING
A young ADJUNCT is walking Milnor fast down the long hall.
ADJUNCT
So the old guy tries to get into the

library but he doesn’t have ID...

MILNOR
Why can’t people read their memos...

ADJUNCT
And he goes totally nuts...

They arrive at the picture window at the end of the hall. Milnor
looks down, expression darkening...

THROUGH THE WINDOW-COURTYARD-HIGH ANGLE

Amidst a crowd of gaping students, Nash is storming the courtyard
in tight figure eights, CURSING at the empty air.

MILNOR
Shit!

EXT . - COURTYARD-AFTERNOON

Nash walks his figure eights. William keeps pace, matching Nash
step for step, right in his face.

PARCHER
Is this what you are, Soldier? Some
useless ghoul. The local madman?
 

 

 

109

NASH
Get away from me!

PARCHER
You're going to end up old, ina
cell. Worthless. Discarded.

NASH
Go to hell!

PARCHER
And while you rock and drool, the
world will burn to ashes.

Two campus cops peel away from the inside of the crowd, heading
towards Nash. Milnor gets there first, grabbing Nash.

MILNOR
{shakes him)
John? John.

Nash stops. Faces Milnor. William stands behind them.

MILNOR
I’m sorry...

Nash is looking around. At the gaping students. The still wary
security guards. All staring at him.

MILNOR
I just heard what happened...

But John has stopped listening. His eyes are hollow with
embarrassment, defeat. A beat. Then he walks off towards the gate.

MILNOR
Nash...

But John keeps walking. William smiles. Opens his arm.

PARCHER
Ladies and Gentleman, the great John
Nash.

INT.-NASH LIVING ROOM-EVENING

Nash sits on the couch, shirt untucked, tie half off, staring at
the floor. His face, his posture, a portrait of surrender.

(OVER) The BANGING gets LOUDER. Finally, Nash rises. As if moving
through molasses, heads towards the kitchen and the SOUND...
 

110
INT.-NASH HOUSE-PANTRY-EVENING

Alicia sits on the floor next to the open back of the clothes
dryer. Pieces of fan and belt are spread out before her.

NASH
= was wrong. I don’t think-

ALICIA
Can you check the motor?

Nash stares at her. Then he leans over, lifts the part.
NASH
There’s carbon build up on the
rotator grooves...

Nash squats, shaves a groove with a screwdriver.

NASH
ry it now...

Alicia replaces the part. Tries the power. A HUM but no action.

ALICIA
It still won't work.

Nash looks at the assembly. Tries the switch. Feels the machine.

NASH
It just ran hot. Maybe try again
tomorrow.
Alicia nods.
NASH

Rosen was right. I can’t do-
She reaches forward, touches her finger to his lips to quiet him.

ALICIA
Maybe try again tomorrow.

INT.-NASH HOUSE-LIVING ROOM-LATER
Alicia ENTERS, toweling grease off her hands. No sign of John.
INT.-NASH HOUSE-TOOL SHED-NIGHT

John opens the door, turns on the light. No lab. Just walls and
walls of clippings.

PARCHER
Welcome back.

William stands in the corner, arms crossed.

PARCHER
Close the door.

John stares at him a beat. Then he obliges.

PARCHER
I want you to listen to me very
carefully. None of this is real.

Nash can’t help but stifle a LAUGH of surprise. William smiles.

PARCHER
Tronic, I know. But true. Think
about it? Do you really believe
Rosen would just leave you in the
house after you hit Alicia?

NASH
I didn't hit-.

PARCHER
That Princeton would let you hang
around, ranting at their students
like a madman? That you could think
your way out of a disease?

William steps away from the wall, walks towards him.

PARCHER
Rosen drugged you, John. You’re ina
cell at Mclean. This is all a
hypnotically induced hallucination
to keep you from doing your work.

William has moved close.
PARCHER
It’s 1954. Mind control through
chemicals is the rage. We’re doing
it. They're doing it. To you. What
you need to defeat them is belief.
Not in me. But in your unique value.
Belief in yourself. Surrender that
and thousands die.

Nash stares at him a beat. Then he reaches up and grabs a clipping.
112

 

vo NASH
You‘re the one who’s not real.

He tears the clipping down. William looks him right in the eyes.
PARCHER
You see us. We see you. Who’s to
say?
Still holding his gaze, Nash tears another clipping from the wal?.

NASH
I am.

William leans in close. And smiles a smile to freeze your heart.

PARCHER
You‘re still talking to me.

INT. -PRINCETON-FINE HALL-CONTINUOUS

Students file into a classroom. Nash stands at the door facing
Charles and Marcee, Alicia’s handkerchief in his hand fer courage.

CHARLES
co You can’t ignore me forever.

NASH
You were a good friend to me. The
best. But I won’t talk to you again.

Nash bends on one knee before Marcee and touches her tiny cheek.

NASH
Or you either, baby girl.
(kisses her head)
Goodbye.

A PROFESSOR comes to the doorway, stops to stare at this odd man on
his knee, kissing thin air. Nash rises, turns to the Professor.

NASH
I was wondering if I might audit
your class?

PROFESSOR
I’m sorry, you have to be enrolled-

The young Professor’s eyes narrow. He seems suddenly flustered.

 
 

 

 

113
PROFESSOR
Oh. Of course. Dr. Milnor mentioned.
It’s...it’s an honor sir.
John is about to step over the threshold of the door. He stops.

PROFESSOR
Is something’ wrong?

NASH
It’s my first class.

And with that, he steps inside. Charles and Marcee follow.
INT.-NASE HOUSE-NIGHT

John wakes. Rises to get a drink of water. He pulls open the
bathroom door but beyond there is only solid wall. He spins...

INT. -MCLEAN-CZLL-NIGHT

Small. Dark. Windows barred. John looks around wildly, heart
sinking with shock and dread. William steps out of the shadows.

PARCHER
We don’t have much time. This is the
real world. Don’t let them drug you
again. Hang on, Nash-

(OVER) The door UNLOCKS. Opens. A Nurse steps in, hypo in her hand,
face hidden by shadow. She steps forward into the light. Alicia.

INT.-NASH BEDROOM-NIGHT
Nash jolts awake with a start. Alicia is sitting up beside him.

ALICIA
John? Are you all right?

He stares at her a beat. Not so sure.

NASH
Give me time...

A couple of STUDENTS stand before the large circular window,
covered now with wax markings. The symbols seem disorganized.

STUDENT |
Gibberish.

The second begins wiping off the window.

VOICE (OVER)
Get away! Don’t touch that!

They turn to find Nash, towering over them, face distraught.

NASE
Get away, do you hear me? Get away.

STUDENT
Freak.

They walk off. Nash goes to the window, with his wax pencil begins
trying to reconstruct the symbols.

A beat. Then he touches his head to the glass, defeated, looks down
at the courtyard below. What he sees is startling. See it now...

EXT.-GAMES QUAD-DAY

A slightly older Nash stands at a gaming table watching two kids
finish a game of Nash. After they leave, he makes a move.

One of the kids returns to grab a forgotten book. Notices Nash’s
move. Nash starts to explain, looks over the boy’s shoulder to...

EXT. - COMMON -SPRING

A slightly older Nash sits amidst a group of students under a tree,
listening to Milnor give a seminar.

Nash seems out of place. Marcee plays with his hair but he ignores
her, taking notes. Nash looks to see...

EXT-COURTYARD-DAY

A slightly older Nash walks in figure eights, silent as William
SHOUTS in his face.

Students pass without a second glance, folks used to him by now.
Nash looks towards...

EXT.-PRINCETON-MAIN GATE

A slightly older Nash sits under a giant weeping willow, having a
picnic with Alicia. Nash LAUGHS, looks up towards...

EXT.-PRINCETON LIBRARY WINDOW-DAY

A figure looks down at campus through rows of symbols that cover
the glass before him. It’s Nash, ten years older then when we left
him here.

INT. -LIBRARY-1970'S

Nash finishes writing on the pane. The symbols are now orderly,
their sequences in long, graceful lines.

He takes a step back, appraises his work. Allows a slight nod and
walks off.

PAN RIGHT. Two STUDENTS, one SKINNY, one FAIR, have been watching.
They move to the window, stare at the equations.

SKINNY STUDENT
Oh, man. Look at this...

FAT STUDENT
I think he solved Riemann...

INT.-LIBRARY-MINUTES LATER

Nash works over his pad at one of the oak tables. Marcee sits on
the table top in front of him, reading Green Eggs and Ham.

VOICE (OVER)
Professor Nash?

John looks up to face the Skinny Student.

STUDENT
You are John Nash, right?

Nash looks at him and smiles.

STUDENT
You solved the Riemann Hypothesis.

NASH
Actually there’s an error in my last
line of code. But I’m getting there.

The Student PLONKS his textbook on the table. Opens it.
116

 

STUDENT
I've been studying your bargaining
equilibria.

TEXT BOOK-CLOSE. Under the title FUNDAMENTALS IN MATHEMATICS is
Nash's Bargaining Equilibria.

NASH
Hang around long enough and you
become famous.

STUDENT
It’s all I want. To be like you.
Come up with something totally
original, you know?

John looks at this boy, the ambition in his eyes. So bright, so
familiar. The kid slides his notebook towards Nash.

STUDENT
Maybe you'd take a look...

NASH
When was the last time you ate?

 

The boy stares at him blankly.

NASH
You know, food?

Nash closes the boy’s notebook. Reaches into his brown paper lunch
bag and removes a sandwich.

NASH
The woman loves mayonnaise.

He slides half his sandwich across. Pats the chair next to him.

NASH
- Why don’t you tell me how you're
adjusting to school? I know how
difficult it can be...

EXT.-PRINCETON-GAMES QUAD-DAY

Nash sits at one of the games tables over a go board. Milnor walks
up, older now, sits down across from him.

MILNOR
How many times did we sit here? A
hundred?
 

CO

Nash looks.
The stare at him with little emotion.

117

NASH
A hundred lifetimes ago.

MILNOR
My secretary said you were looking
for me.

NASH
I was thinking I might teach.

MILNOR
You‘re a terrible teacher, John.

NASH
Details, details.

Milnor stares at him.

MILNOR
What about, you know... Are they
gone?

NASH

Oh no, they’re not gone. Maybe
they’1l never be.

Sitting across the path are Charles, William and

NASH
But I’ve gotten used tc ignoring
them. And I think, as a result,
they’ve kind of given up on me. Do
you think that’s the way it is with
our dreams and our nightmares? That
we have to keep feeding them for
them to stay alive?

MILNOR
But they haunt you?

NASH
They're my past, Martin. Everybody's
haunted by their past.

Milnor looks up. Shapely, Fox and Zweifel race past. All young. He
looks back at Nash and the cool autumn day is empty once more.

NASH
Do you understand?
——

 

 

 

118

MILNOR
Maybe. Almost.

A beat. Then Jchn stands.
NASH
I’ve got to go. Alicia still worries
if I’m late. You get a lot of
attention when you're crazy.
MILNOR
I‘ll talk to the department. Maybe
in the. Spring semester.
John nods, begins to head off.

MILNOR
Hey, Nash.

Nash spins. Milnor TAPS the game board in front of him.

MILNOR
You scared?

John stares at him. Then he grins.

As John goes and sits back down PULL BACK AND UP over these two old
friends, playing with the hearts of the boys they once were.

EXT.-NASH HOUSE-TWILIGHT
Lights burn. Alicia’s car pulls into the driveway.
INT.-NASH HOUSE-TWILIGHT

An unfinished painting sits on an easel. Walden Pond in winter,
trees lifeless, but off the ice, a sparkle that might be hope.

The door opens and Alicia ENTERS. Looks around. The phone receiver
hangs off the hook, swinging by the cord. Her expression darkens.

ALICIA
John?

INT. -CAR-PRINCETON-DRIVING-NIGHT

Alicia drives, expression intense. Looking. She spots a man in a
doorway, RANTING. She slows. Just a stranger.

Alicia takes a beat, gathers herself. Drives on.

EXT.-PRINCETON-NASH'S DORM-NIGHT

Nash stands on the same roof where he and Charles passed the flask,
so very long ago.

“RLICIA |
Looking for divine inspiration?

John looks at her. A beat. Then into the distance again.

NASH
Milnor’s dead. His car crashed on
95. He was buying a goldfish.

ALICIA
Oh God, John, no. I’m so sorry.

NASH
And I thought, what if I suddenly
wake up in a cell and you’re the
enemy. What if the world shatters
again and I can’t hold on?

She stares at him, eyes sparkling in the moonlight.

ALICIA
But you held on.

NASH
I held on.

He turns to face her, to look right into her eyes.
NASH
Because none of that felt as real,
as the chance of losing you.

He looks up at the glittering panoply streaking the night sky.

- ALICIA
Do you see the umbrella?
NASH
No. Just stars.
ALICIA
(pointing)

Here. Let me show you.

As she slides her arm around him, HOLD on this couple. Standing
together against all the dark in the world.

INT.-FINE HALL-DAY
NASH-CLOSE. Clean shaven, hair cut short. Dazzling.

NASH
I can do this. They’re only kids,
right? What can they do to me. Write
slanderous comments on bathroom
walls. How bad could it be?
(a beat)
Horrible. It could be horrible.

From this angle John might be talking to himself. PULL BACK TO
REVEAL he’s not alone. Alicia is standing behind him.

NASH
(hands to his chest)
Oh no. Where’s-

His face is suddenly child-like with panic. She reaches into her
purse, takes out what he was looking for. Her handkerchief, which
she folds and places in his pocket.

He smiles at her.

NASH
Thanks.

He turns and heads into the classroom. Alicia stares at him through
the door as the kids settle.

When I was a student here, they used
to say you had to be certifiable to
take this class.

John’s smile is brilliant.

NASH :
Now it seems you just have to be
certifiable to teach it.

The kids BREAK out in LAUGHTER, the tension broken.
NASH
My name is John Nash. And I am going
to be your teacher. Welcome to
mathematics in thought and action.

ALICIA-CLOSE. Eyes bright with pride.

HOLD on the CLASSROOM DOOR as Alicia slowly DISSOLVES. The hallway
CHANGES COLOR once, then AGAIN, time passing until we are...

INT.-PRINCETON-FINE HALL-1990's

THE DOOR swings open. Nash emerges amidst a gaggle of students. His
suit is tailored, his face covered with a close beard. The way the
students cling to him, JABBERING, this man is one fine teacher.

MAN (OVER)
Professor Nash?

A MAN is standing by the doorway. This is HOWARD KUHN. Nash’s smile
is polite, but vaguely puzzled. Turns to one of his students.

NASH
Do you see him?

The student nods.

NASH
You'll ‘forgive me. I’m always
suspicious of new people. .

Although Kuhn is puzzled, the students seem to take it in stride.
They just like this guy.

STUDENT
See you next week, Professor.

Nash watches them go, smiling, paternal.

NASH
I have a son that age. Harvard.
(rolls his eyes)
So, now that you are real, who are
you and what can I do you for?

Kuhn takes a beat before speaking. Then...
. KUHN
Professor, my name is Howard Kuhn. I
am here to tell you you are. being
considered for the Nobel Prize.
INT.-FINE HALL-WALKING-MINUTES LATER
Nash and Kuhn walk. Students who pass greet Nash.

NASH
I’m sorry. I’m just a bit stunned.

KUHN
Over the last ten years your
bargaining equilibria has become a
foundation of modern economics.

They have come to a familiar doorway. It’s the faculty lounge.

High Tea is in progress. The formal dress is gone. The students are
‘multi-national, the waiters women. But the ritual is the same.

KUHN
Shall we have some tea?

Nash stares through the door a long beat. When he looks back at
Kuhn, his eyes are sad.

NASH
I’m not formally a member of the
department. I...

There is a tragic tenderness to his expression, an acknowledgement
of all that has been lost to time.

KUHN
I guest lectured here before the
war. I‘m sure it will be all right.

He puts his hand on the small of John’s back. John looks at him
warily and then, finally, steps over the threshold.

INT.-FINE HALL-MATH FACULTY LOUNGE-DAY

Nash and Kuhn sit across from each other. A young girl serves them
tea from a silver service. Nash smiles at her.

NASH
Things have changed.

The sentence seems to resonate more deeply to him than he had
intended as it rolls off his lips. He grows pensive a beat. Then...

NASH
I thought the nominations for the
Nobel Prize were secret. I thought
you only knew if you won or lost.

KUHN
That is generally the case, yes. But
these are special circumstances. The
awards are substantial. They require
private funding. As such, the image
of the Nobel is quite important...
 

 

 

 

123
Kuhn stops a beat. Takes a sip of tea.

NASH
So you came here to see if I was
crazy. To see if I'd = screw

everything up if I actually won.
Maybe dance at the podium or strip
naked and squawk like a chicken.

It’s Nash's tone that put’s Kuhn at ease.

KUHN
Something like that, yes.

Nash stops, stares off. Then...

NASH

Would I embarrass you? Yes, 1!
suppose it’s possible. You see, I am
crazy. I am dependant on the newer
medications. I still see things that
are not here. But I choose to ignore
them. Like a diet of the mind. I do
not indulge certain appetites. My
appetite for patterns. And perhaps
my appetite to imagine, even to
dream. I have lost much. But...

He opens his hands.

STUDENT
Professor Nash?

John looks up. A young faculty member is staring at him. He reaches
into his pocket, lays something down in front of him. It’s his pen.

WIDER

Another teacher stands behind him. He too lays his pen down before -

Nash. And now everyone in the room is rising, coming to him, laying
their pens down, one after another in a growing tribute to a
lifetime of accomplishment.

KUHN
What...?

The pens keep coming. Nash opens his mouth to answer. But he can’t,
eyes suddenly flooding with tears for this journey taken so very
far.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT.-ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY-NOBEL CEREMONY

A giant hall. Full. Nash stands at the podium, blinking his eyes.
Hundreds sit watching, as camera flashbulbs finally cease.

But Nash just stands there. A long beat. And even longer.
KUHN-CLOSE. In the audience. Concerned.
ALICIA-CLOSE. In the front row. Starting to worry.

BACK TO NASH. Still standing there. See what he sees. Hundreds of
faces staring back at him. Finally, just when all seems lost...

NASH
Thank you. Thank you for your
patience.

But he’s not looking at the speech before him. He’s not looking at
the Audience. He’s looking only at Alicia.

NASH

I have always believed in numbers.
In the equations and logics that
lead to reason. I was wrong. It is
only in the mysterious equations of
love that any logic or reason can be
found. Perhaps it is good to have a
beautiful mind. But a better gift is
to discover a beautiful heart.

And suddenly there is no one else in the room but the two of them,
Nash’s magical vision revealing the patterns of the heart.

NASH
Thank you for your belief in me
after so many years. You are the
reason I am here today.

Nash reaches into his breast pocket and takes out something
familiar. It’s her rose embroidered handkerchief.

NASH
You are the reason I am.

And with that he tucks the handkerchief in his suit pocket.

NASH
Thank you.

12s
The room EXPLODES with APPLAUSE, suddenly full again. Zweifel
stands, his APPLAUSE ever more enthusiastic, as does Fox, and then
those around them, all rising in ovation.
ALICIA-CLOSE. CLAPS as hard as the rest, full of love and pride.

John just Stands on stage. Taking it all in. Then, finally, he
bows, folks APPLAUDING even so loud that Nash can’t stifle a LAUGH.

INT.-ROYAL SWEDISH ACADEMY-COCKTAIL RECEPTION
John stands with Alicia and amidst the dwindling well wishers.

ALICIA
Time to go?

NASH
Yes, please.

He helps her on with her wrap. That’s when he sees them, standing
by the door. Three familiar figures. Charles, Marcee and William.

Then William does something odd. He gives Nash a small salute.

ALICIA
What is it? What’s wrong?

He turns to his wife. His smile is long in coming, but when it
comes, it melts the worry on his face along with our hearts.

NASH
Nothing. Nothing at all.

He takes her hand, turning his back on them, man and wife heading
away together, outside, into the light and gone.

FINAL FADE TO BLACK.
