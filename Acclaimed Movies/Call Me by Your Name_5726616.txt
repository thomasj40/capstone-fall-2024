André Aciman
INT. ELIO’S/OLIVER’S ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 1

The sound of an approaching car. ELIO, 17, barefoot and in
his bathing suit, is in the process of moving his clothes
from his room to the adjacent room - a wardrobe somehow
refurbished into a single bedroom. The two rooms are
separated by a ruined wooden door, with cracks all over it.
MARZIA, a girl of about his same age, is lying on the bed. It
is obvious both have been on it together.

ELIO goes to the window and looks down. A car pulls up below,
blowing up clouds of dust, and stops at the villa’s main
entrance. A young man steps out of the car, wearing a billowy
bright blue shirt with a wide-open collar, sunglasses. This
is OLIVER, 25. He is followed by the handy-man and gardener
of the house ANCHISE.

ELIO

(in French)
L'usurpateur.
(The usurper)

MARZIA jumps up to come stand next to him, looking down.

ANCHISE appears below followed by the PERLMANS who introduce
themselves to Oliver. Professor PERLMAN is in his fifties,
distinguished, vigorous. ANNELLA, his wife, is in her mid-
forties.

ANNELLA
(in Italian)
Dove 6 Elio?
(Where’s Elio?)

ELIO
(in French)
Il faut que je descende.
(I'd better go down.)

INT. STAIRCASE - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 2

At the end of the stairs ELIO sees OLIVER being walked to
Professor Perlman’s study. Oliver’s suitcase and backpack lie
on the floor nearby. ANNELLA sees Elio approaching and
gestures towards them.

ANNELLA
(in Italian)
Aiuta Oliver a portare
le sue cose in camera tua.
(Help bring Oliver’s things up to
your room.)
INT. PROFESSOR PERLMAN’S STUDY - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 3

ELIO enters his father’s studio. OLIVER, sitting on the sofa,
is having a glass of fresh water. Even if exhausted by the
heat, he remains elegant and somewhat iconic. Professor
PERLMAN introduces the two formally. They shake hands.

ELIO
I’m Elio.
OLIVER
(non committal)
Hi.
INT. STAIRCASE - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 4

They head up the stairs together; ELIO lunges for the heavy
suitcase, OLIVER takes the backpack.

ELIO
My room is now your room. I’1l be
next door.

They meet MARZIA coming down. More introductions in the
middle of the stairs. OLIVER is curious about her and looks
back as he continues up. She looks back after he does.

INT. OLIVER’S ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 5

They enter Oliver’s bedroom. OLIVER drops his backpack and
crashes on the bed, exhausted. ELIO lays the suitcase next to
the bed.

ELIO
We're sharing the bathroom. It's my
only way out...

But Oliver is not listening, already asleep. Elio walks out
and closes the door that separates their two rooms.

EXT. GARDEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 6

In front of the kitchen is a fruit orchard with a variety of
fruit trees. From outside we see inside MAFALDA at work in
charge of the domestic duties of the place, and she is
virtually a member of the family.

One of the trees is shaking. In the dappled light under the
tree we see ANCHISE reaching up into the limbs to pick the
ripest peaches. They seem to glow within their foliage as his
long, gnarled fingers seek them out. He carefully places the
fruit he has picked in a basket.
INT. STAIRCASE - PERLMAN VILLA - DUSK 7

Later. MAFALDA, at the bottom of the stairs, rings a bell.
She looks up the stairs and, getting no response, rings the
bell again.

INT. ELIO’S/OLIVER’S ROOM/BATHROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DUSK 8

ELIO is at the desk in his small “new” bedroom; he is
transcribing music. Next to his desk lamp a walkman is
playing music. He hears the bell.

He enters the bathroom and the door that connects it to the
other room is open. OLIVER sleeps in the dim light of sunset.

ELIO
We’ re being called to dinner.

No answer. Elio enters Oliver's room and reaches over to the
bookshelf, takes a book from it but then drops it on the
floor. It makes a sharp clatter. Oliver is briskly awoken.

ELIO (CONT’D)
(embarrassed)
We’ re being called to dinner.

Oliver looks up from his pillow scarcely knowing where he is.

OLIVER
Later. I’1l1 have to pass.
(beat)
Can you make my excuses to your
mother?

Elio, backing out of the door with the book, nods that he
will. Oliver looks around for a moment.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
So, this is usually your room..

About to shut the door, ELIO nods.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Thanks, buddy.

Oliver turns and goes back to sleep. Elio closes the door,
leaving the room in almost complete darkness.

INT. STAIRCASE/BOCCHIRALE - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 9

The following day. OLIVER is coming down the stairs. Not
knowing where to go, he listens for the Perlmans' voices
until he sees, through a corridor, the kitchen. Just beyond
it, outside in the garden, he can see the family having
breakfast.
10

EXT. GARDEN IN FRONT OF THE KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 10

The PERLMANS are eating breakfast outside, in front of the
kitchen. OLIVER comes out and sits down, watching how ELIO
expertly cracks his soft-boiled egg shell, then attempts to
do the same, but only a tiny bit of the shell is pierced, so
he pretends to busy himself with his coffee and pushes the
egg in its cup away. MAFALDA asks him if he would like juice.
He says “Please”. She looks down at the discarded egg.

MAFALDA
Lasci fare a me, Signore. (Let me)

She slices the top off and returns to her kitchen.

ANNELLA
Did you recover from your trip,
caro?

OLIVER
Big time.

ELIO, who has been trying not to stare at their guest and is
concentrating on spreading honey on a piece of bread, now
lifts his head and speaks, growing unnaturally loud:

ELIO
I can show you around.

OLIVER
Good. Are we far from the town? I
need to open a bank account.

Both Professor PERLMAN and ANNELLA look up, interested.

PERLMAN
(smiling)
None of our residents has ever had
a local bank account.

Elio turns in his seat to get a better view of Oliver, who is
sitting beside him.

ELIO
Should I take him to Montodine?

PERLMAN
I’m think they’ re closed for summer
vacation. Try Crema.

OLIVER
Is that your orchard?

PERLMAN
Pesca, ciliege, albicocche...
(peaches, cherries, apricots...)
11

ANNELLA
Pomegranate.

MAFALDA returns with a pitcher of apricot juice on a little
tray and proceeds to fill Oliver’s glass. OLIVER tastes it,
then enthusiastically downs it. ELIO realizes he is staring
at OLIVER, his head tipped back with his throat swallowing
the juice, and notices the Star of David on a necklace around
his neck. OLIVER smacks his lips and begins to eat his second
egg, giving it a sharp crack. MAFALDA brings him a third egg.

ANNELLA (CONT’D)
Have another egg.

OLIVER
(shaking his head)
I know myself. If I have three,
I’1l have a fourth, and more.

ELIO has never heard someone Oliver’s age say, I know myself.
It’s somewhat intimidating. He lowers his eyes.

INT. PROFESSOR PERLMAN’S STUDY - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 11

PERLMAN is attempting to devise a new filing system for his
correspondence; there are packs of letters lying about and
open boxes with more letters. OLIVER is helping him, ELIO is
with them. The professor makes a joking comment like "My
guest from last year was very good at organizing. I on the
other hand...”

NARRATOR
Taking a summer guest for six weeks
is the way Professor helps young
academics revise a manuscript
before publication. They are given
full run of the house and can
basically use their time as they
like, provided they help Professor
Perlman for an hour or so every day
with his correspondence and other
paperwork.

ANNELLA enters carrying a little tray with a pitcher of more
apricot juice which she pours out into glasses. Everyone has
some; OLIVER downs his in a gulp. He smacks his lips, says
“aAh!”,. Annella looks at him amused and gives him an approving
pat on the shoulder. Elio looks at his father, already
knowing what he’1l say.

PERLMAN
The word apricot comes from the
Arabic - it’s like the words
“algebra”, “alchemy”, and
“alcohol”. It derives from an
Arabic noun combined with the
Arabic article ‘al-’ before it.

(MORE)
PERLMAN (CONT'D)
The origin of our Italian
‘albicocca’ was ‘al-barquq’...

He pauses to draw breath, then continues, warming to his
subject.

PERLMAN (CONT’D)
It’s amazing that today in Israel
and many Arab countries the fruit
is referred to by a totally
different name: ‘mishmish’.

ANNELLA
When we visited Persia they called
it Zardoulou.

PROFESSOR PERLMAN, shrugging, spreads his hands as if to say,
‘Who can ever tell about these matters of present-day
etymology?’. Through all this OLIVER has been listening
carefully.

OLIVER
I beg to differ.
PERLMAN
Ah?
OLIVER
The word is not actually an Arabic
word.
PERLMAN
How so?

ELIO and ANNELLA listen carefully, surprised.

OLIVER

It’s a long story, so bear with me,
Pro. Many Latin words are derived
from the Greek. In the case of
‘apricot’, however, it’s the other
way around.

(he throws a quick, amused

look at ELIO)
Here the Greek takes over from
Latin. The Latin word was
praecoquum, from pre-coquere, pre-
cook, to ripen early, as in
precocious, meaning premature.

The others take this in. ANNELLA is clearly charmed.

OLIVER (CONT’D) The
Byzantines - to go on - borrowed
praecox, and it became prekokkia
or berikokki, which is finally
how the Arabs must have
inherited it as al-barquq.
Revision7.

There is a moment of silence. ELIO and ANNELLA look at
Perlman.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Courtesy Philology 101.

PERLMAN
(somewhat under his
breath)
He’s right, he’s right.

ANNELLA, unable to resist, reaches out to OLIVER and ruffles
his hair, laughing.

ELIO applauds.

ELIO
He does it every year...

ANNELLA
Every year.

PERLMAN
I was testing you.

12 EXT. ROAD TO CREMA - DAY 12

ELIO and OLIVER are riding bicycles, with Elio in the lead.
They go along the main road towards the town of Crema and its
bank. The day is already hot.

13 EXT. CAFE - CREMA TOWN SQUARE - DAY 13

ELIO and OLIVER are sitting at the little cafe with iron
chairs and tables, drinking coffee. OLIVER examines bank
application forms, then folds them up and puts them in his
knapsack. He looks around the almost empty square.

OLIVER
What does one do around here?

ELIO
Nothing. Wait for summer to end.

OLIVER
What do you do in the winter, then?
Don’t tell me: wait for summer,
right?

ELIO
We come here only for Christmas and
some other vacation..

OLIVER
Christmas?
14

ELIO
And Easter too. We are Jewish,
English, American, Italian,
French... somewhat atypical.
Besides my family you are probably
the only other Jew who has set foot
in this town.

OLIVER
I am from a small town in New
England. I know what its like to be
the odd Jew out. (beat) And what
else do you do here in summer,
besides this?

ELIO smiles, says nothing. They both laugh.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
What do you do?

ELIO
Transcribe music. Read books. Swim
at the river. Go out at night.

OLIVER takes this in, his eyes hidden by dark sunglasses as
he gathers up his things, cutting their conversation off.
They silently reclaim their bikes. OLIVER seems to be miles
away, but as ELIO is getting on his bike, he loses balance
for a moment and OLIVER puts his arm around Elio’s shoulder,
steadying him. He then speeds off, saying “Later”, leaving
ELIO on his own.

EXT. SOUTH TERRAZZA - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 14

The same day. ELIO is sitting at a table in the shade of the
house, practicing his guitar. From where he sits he can see
OLIVER ride up on his bike and dismount. He has to pass by
ANCHISE, who is doing some garden work with small plants and
a ball of twine. OLIVER stops to watch and converses with
ANCHISE in Italian.

ANCHISE
Non bisogna dare troppa acqua ai
pomodori. (You dont want to douse
the tomatoes with too much water)

OLIVER
Pomodori? Oh, Tomatoes...

ANCHISE
Si! Tomatos.. Se crescono troppo in
fretta saranno pieni di semi. No
good! (They will grow too fast.
They will be mealy.)

ELIO sees this but is too far away to hear what they say.
15

Later. OLIVER is lying on a towel spread on the grass nearby,
reading a book, which we see is Heraclithus. He wears a green
bathing suit and his straw hat. His belongings are spread out
around him: sun lotion, a note pad and pen, espadrilles.

At the bottom of the stairs, in the middle of the field, the
PERLMANS and some FRIENDS in bathing suits are sitting around
an old stone drinking trough, now used to freshen up. There
are always people coming and going at the Perlmans’ -
friends, relatives, acquaintances of Elio, like Marzia. We
don’t always learn who they are, but they give a sense of
ever-moving inhabitants of the place.

Oliver lowers his book and stares at ELIO, who is focused on
the fingerboard. ELIO raises his face to see if OLIVER likes
what he is playing, but OLIVER looks back without expression,
almost coldly.

Unsettled, ELIO breaks off for a moment, then returns to his
music-making, looking down. OLIVER, aware that he has caused
ELIO to interrupt his flow, gets up and comes over to where

ELIO is sitting. ELIO is non-committal, hiding hurt feelings.
In a pause, OLIVER questions Elio about the piece that broke

off - who was it, or is it yours? Do I know it?... It sounded
like... ELIO hits some notes: This? Or that?
OLIVER
Just play it again.
ELIO
I thought you didn’t like it. Hated
it...
OLIVER

Hated it? What gave you that
idea?.. Just play it, will you?

ELIO
The same one?

OLIVER
The same one.

The tall, half-naked OLIVER, hanging over him intimidatingly,
causes ELIO to get up and enter the house through the big
door.

INT. LIVING ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 15

ELIO plays the piece on the piano. OLIVER leans on the door
looking in. The music sounds very different from when he
played it on his guitar.

OLIVER
You changed it. What did you do to
it? Is it Bach?
16

10.

ELIO
I just played it the way Liszt
would have played it if he’d
jimmied around with it.

OLIVER
Just play it again, please!

ELIO begins playing the piece again. OLIVER listens, then
speaks:

OLIVER (CONT’D)
I can’t believe you changed it
again.

ELIO
Not by much. That’s how Busoni
would've played it if he’d altered
Liszt’s version.

OLIVER
Can’t you just play the Bach the
way Bach wrote it?

ELIO
Bach never wrote it for guitar. In
fact, we’re not even sure it’s Bach
at all.

OLIVER
Forget I asked.

ELIO
Okay, okay. No need to get so
worked up.

ELIO begins to play the Bach in its original form. OLIVER,
who had turned away, comes back to the door. ELIO says,
softly, over his playing:

ELIO (CONT’D)
It’s young Bach, he dedicated it to
his brother.

He plays it beautifully, as if sending it to OLIVER as a
gift.

INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - LATER 16

ELIO is writing his diary, the wind is moving the curtains.
He then puts the open diary on the bed and goes into the
shared bathroom to pee, shutting the door behind him. The
camera moves close on to the diary and we read: “...I was too
harsh when I told him I thought he hated Bach...”
17

18

11.

The wind blows the pages of the little book, then dies down
so that we can go on reading: “What I wanted to say was that
I thought he hated me...”

EXT. STREETS/CARD CAFE - TOWN STREET - DAY 17
Another day.

OLIVER and ELIO walk down a street; OLIVER steps into a cafe.
Some men inside are sitting at two or three tables with
playing cards. Waiters bring coffee and other drinks to the
customers, the place is lively.

NARRATOR
Taking in summer guests was Elio’s
dad and mom, The Perlmans, a way of
helping young academics revise
manuscript before publication.
Summer residents didn’t have to pay
anything, they were given the full
run of the house and could
basically do anything they pleased,
provided they spent an hour or so a
day helping Professor Perlman with
his correspondence and assorted
paperwork. Oliver manuscript was on
Heraclithus and already had found a
publisher in Italy for a translated
version. Elio’s father loved
nothing better than to have some
precocious rising expert in his
field of study helping him.

Some of the men look up and nod at OLIVER. A game is starting
at one of the tables and OLIVER is asked to join. He sits
down to play.

ELIO
How did you know about this place?

Oliver winks. ELIO pulls up a chair and sits, spectating. The
cards are dealt. OLIVER, accepted at once, treats his fellow
PLAYERS as equals. Despite being a ‘rich’ American
‘intellectual’, a guest at the villa of one of the area’s
richest men, he has the ‘common touch’.

ELIO is soon forgotten by OLIVER. Now and then he supplies a
translation of something said in Lombard dialect by one of
the PLAYERS, to which OLIVER replies, “Thanks, Buddy!”

EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE LAWN - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 18

A few of ELIO’S FRIENDS play a volleyball game in a makeshift
court set up on the lawn by the main entrance of the villa.
OLIVER is playing with CHIARA, MARZIA’s slightly older
sister, and another BOY.
12.

The three make up one side of the game, while the opposing
team is made up of THREE OTHERS we haven't met.

ELIO sits on the side with MARZIA and another friend MARIA.
All eyes are on OLIVER, the glamorous American who has
unexpectedly dropped into their midst. MARZIA and her friend
ask questions about him.

MARZIA
(in Italian)
Sicuramente @ meglio di quello
dell’anno scorso, ti ricordi?
(He’s certainly a big improvement
from last year, do you remember?)

ELIO and MARZIA laugh.

MARIA
(in Italian)
Oliver € un cowboy biondo
datinista!
(Oliver is a latin blonde scolar
cowboy!)

ELIO gives MARIA a look that says “Yes”, rolling his eyes.

MARIA (CONT’D)
(looking at Elio and Marzia)
Bella fregatura! Un’altra estate
nella lavanderia.
(Well, that sucks for you guys!
Another summer in the lavanderia.)

MARZIA jokingly punches MARIA’s shoulder. ELIO, bored and put
off, gets up and goes to a nearby table under the lime trees,
on it is some fresh fruit and a bottle of cold water.

He takes the bottle and goes to his friends, offering it.
OLIVER takes the bottle and drinks, then hands it back to
ELIO without thanking him. OLIVER then puts his free arm
around ELIO, gently squeezing his thumb and forefingers into
Elio’s shoulder in a friendly hug-massage.

ELIO, taken by surprise, is spellbound for an instant,
yielding to Oliver’s hand, even leaning into it -- then he
wrenches himself away from Oliver’s grab. Taken aback, OLIVER
apologizes, asking ELIO if he’d pressed a nerve or something:
“I didn’t mean to hurt you”. Honestly not wanting to
discourage OLIVER, ELIO blurts out “I’m not hurt”. ELIO has
the face of someone trying, but failing, to smother a grimace
of pain. OLIVER goes along with this charade.

OLIVER
(back to massaging Elio’s
shoulder)
Here, let me make it better. Relax.
19

Revision13.

ELIO
But I am relaxing.

OLIVER
You're stiff as a board. You’re
made of knots.
(to Marzia)
Come here, feel this...

MARZIA puts her hands on Elio’s back. OLIVER presses her
flattened palm hard against it.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Here. Feel it? He should relax
more.

MARZIA
You should relax more.

MARIA
(to Oliver)
She certainly knows how to get him
to relax.

ELIO relaxes until the others lose interest and resume the
game. The two boys are playing against the sisters now.
Elio’s view of the players and of the ball in the air over
their heads is often obscured by the OLIVER's muscular back,
moving in closer from the side. Sometimes they collide, trip,
fall into a heap. The girls shout rudely in Italian.

Elio goes back to the table under the lime trees and sits in
the shade, far from the others. He is inadvertently rubbing
the spot that Oliver had massaged at the base of his neck
with his free hand. MAFALDA and ANNELLA are setting up the
table for dinner.

ANNELLA
(in Italian)
C’é Zia Marcella e annessi per
cena. Oliver si ferma con noi o
esce stasera? (Aunt Marcella is
coming to dinner with her tribe. Is
Oliver in or out tonight?)

ELIO
(shrugging, in French)
Je ne sais pas. (Who knows?)

MAFALDA
Che muvi star!
EXT. TABLE UNDER THE LIME TREES - PERLMAN VILLA - EVENING 19
A gangly TEENAGER looks on with pretended disdain; his voice

is just changing, he has a dark fuzz, unshaven, on his upper
lip, he could be Elio three or four years earlier.
20

21

14.

PERLMAN is amusing the boy’s sisters, TWO YOUNG NIECES, aged
about seven and nine, with a card trick. He has moved plates
and cutlery around to make space for entertaining the little
nieces.

PERLMAN
Scegli una carta. OK, ricordala
bene. (Pick a card. OK, remember it
well.)
(shuffles the deck
E questa? (Is this it?)

INT. ELIO’S AND OLIVER’S BATHROOM - EVENING 20

Upstairs ELIO is shaving his own upper lip. He keeps
listening for sounds of the absent Oliver from his room - at
one point he could softly knock on the door, and upon hearing
nothing, look in.

EXT. TABLE UNDER THE LIME TREES - PERLMAN VILLA - EVENING 21

Guests are gathering at the table. MAFALDA announces dinner
and removes the cards from the table, putting things back in
order. PERLMAN makes a funny face. Two empty seats around the
table. The absence of Signor Ulliva is commented upon.
MAFALDA asks ELIO, who just showed up, whether Oliver will be
joining them. “Sono le otto passate” she says. ANNELLA
appears from the living room, followed by her guests.

ANNELLA
(in Italian)
Noi ci mettiamo a tavola (We’ll sit
down) .

ELIO

(in Italian)
Non vi sembra ineducato come dice
“Later...”? arrogante? Mi sembra
che facciamo di tutto per farlo
stare a suo agio da noi. (Don’t you
think it’s rude when he says
“Later...”? Arrogant? After all,
it’s just to show him a good time
here.)

PERLMAN
I don’t think so. I think Oliver is
shy. That’s what he is.

The camera stays on ELIO as he considers the possibility.

ELIO
You watch, this is how he’1ll say
goodbye to us when the time comes.
With his gruff, slapdash, Later!
22

15.

ANNELLA
Meanwhile, we’ll have to put up
with him for six long weeks. Won’t
we?

PERLMAN
I’m telling you, he’s just shy.
You’1l grow to like him.

ELIO
Yeah, but what if I grow to hate
him?

ANNELLA

(to Elio)

Mio piccino!
(My little one!)

(to Mafalda)
Pudé togliere i piatti di Mr.
Oliver? (You can remove Mr.
Oliver’s place setting away?)

This is performed instantly and without a hint of regret.
ELIO watches Oliver’s silverware, his place mat, glass,
napkin, disappear as if he had never existed. ELIO grows
thoughtful at the sudden violence of Mafalda’s action - may
even involuntarily put his own hand out to stop her. The
others take a seat. PERLMAN picks up his napkin to perform a
trick for the children, wrapping it around his thumb.

INT. LIVING ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 22

When everyone returns to the living room, PERLMAN asks his
son to play something he then goes in the bar.

ELIO
Non mi va. (I don’t feel like it)

PERLMAN
Perché non ti va? (Why don’t you
feel like it?)

ELIO
(sharply)
Perché non mi va!

ANNELLA
(In French)
Pourquoi tu ne vas pas
a Moscazzano avec les autres?
(Why not to Moscazzano with the
others?)
23

24

25

16.

ELIO
(In French)
J’en ai pas envie.
(I don’t want to.)

ANNELLA
Go see your friends. Go out. Do
something.
Ne reste pas la comme une araignée
sur le mur, mon chéri!
(Don’t just be a spider on the
wall, darling!)
Spoiling everyone’s fun.

A burst of laughter from the kids. Perlman returns from the
bar holding glasses. The TEENAGE BOY pretends to be a spider
and comes at his cousin waving his arms menacingly. ELIO
gives in, and goes over to the piano. He starts playing a
lively piece.

INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 23

ELIO is on his bed, still dressed, in a restless half-sleep.
He hears a noise outside and quickly strips off his clothes,
putting on his pajama bottoms. But no one comes, there are no
sounds on the stairs or activity in the adjoining bathroom.

INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAWN 24

A ray of sunlight hits ELIO’s sleeping face. He wakes and
gets up. He goes over to the door that separates his room
from Oliver's. He grabs the doorknob and is about to knock,
but doesn't. He looks between the cracks of the door: he can
see Oliver sleeping, still in his clothes.

EXT. LIME TREES - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 25

Another day. ELIO is sitting at his usual table under the
lime trees, working. From where he's sitting, Elio can see
PERLMAN and OLIVER through an open window in his father's
study. They are discussing Oliver’s manuscript on
Heraclithus. Elio tries to listen.

PERLMAN
I think your insights here are
persuasive, but..

OLIVER
Go on, I’m okay with criticism.

PERLMAN
You are? Good. I think this needs
firming up.

(MORE)
26

17.

PERLMAN (CONT'D)
It feels like you need to accept
the paradoxical nature of this
philosopher’s thinking, not just
explain it..

ANCHISE approaches Elio, carrying a large fish wrapped up in
a t-shirt, which he uncovers for Elio.

ELIO
Sei stato al fiume?
(You've been at the river?)

ANCHISE
(smiling)
Si.

Anchise takes the fish towards the kitchen. Meanwhile in the
studio the conversation continues.

OLIVER
(nodding)
I’m okay with firming up - I’m okay
with paradox. Back to the drawing
board.
PERLMAN
Wait...
(ironic, re: Oliver's
shabby look)
Did you have a good time last
night?

ELIO is distracted by the sudden burst of enthusiasm heard
from the kitchen over the fish Anchise caught.

EXT. SOUTH TERRAZZA/ABBEVERATOIO - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 26

Later. ELIO sits with his head back on the cushion of his
chair, his eyes closed. OLIVER, far away, is sitting on the
edge of the trough, his feet in the water, reading the pages
from the manuscript he showed Perlman. He looks towards Elio.
OLIVER
(loud)
Are you sleeping?

He waves a sheet of his manuscript at him.
ELIO
(to himself)

I was.

Oliver gestures him to come closer. Elio does, slowly. He
notices Oliver is wearing a red bathing suit.
27

18.

OLIVER
Just listen to this drivel: “For
the early Greeks, Heidegger
contends, this underlying hidden-
ness is constitutive of the way
beings are, not only in
relation to themselves but also to
other entities generally. In other
words, they do not construe hidden-
ness merely or primarily in terms
of entities' relation to human
beings.”

Oliver looks at Elio.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Does this make any sense to you?
Not to me. Nor to your dad.

ELIO is pleased that Oliver has asked his opinion on the
manuscript.

ELIO
Maybe it did when you wrote it.

OLIVER, as if pretending to weigh Elio’s words carefully.

OLIVER
That’s the kindest thing anyone’s
said to me in months.

He speaks ever so earnestly, as if hit by a sudden
revelation, in a low tone. This makes ELIO feel ill at ease.
He looks away.
ELIO
Kind?

OLIVER
Yes, kind.

Silence returns. ELIO looks at OLIVER, in his red bathing
suit, lying on the edge of the trough. And OLIVER lets
himself fall in the water, to ELIO's surprise.

STILL LIVES 27

Still lives of Oliver's swim trunks of different colors
drying on the bedroom windowsill.

NARRATOR
Oliver had three personalities
depending on which bathing suit he
was wearing. Red: for bold, set in
his ways, gruff and ill-tempered
snappy... dangerous.

NARRATOR (CONT'D)
Yellow: good-humored, funny, but
not without barbs - didn’t give in
too easily.
He didn’t wear his green bathing
suit that often. It meant maybe
that he was eager to learn, eager
to speak, just eager, sunny.

EXT. ABBEVERATOIO - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 28

ELIO observes OLIVER swimming in the narrow and long stone
trough. ANNELLA is close, but she's moving away with a basket
of freshly picked fruit. OLIVER comes out of the water with
his green swim trunks.

OLIVER
Elio! What are you doing?

ELIO
Reading my music.

Oliver lies down on a big towel, his belongings spread around
it.

OLIVER
No you’re not.

ELIO
Thinking, then.

OLIVER
About?

ELIO
Private.

ANNELLA, amused, listens to the conversation.

OLIVER
So you won’t tell me?

ELIO
So I won’t tell you.

OLIVER
(explaining to Annella)
So he won’t tell me.
In that case I’m going with your
mom.

Putting on his espadrilles, OLIVER takes ANNELLA's basket and
follows her to the orchard, goes up to a ladder and climbs
it, stretching into the branches for the ripe fruit as ELIO
watches. ELIO goes over to them and offers to hold the
basket, which is filling with apricots. OLIVER continues to
toss down fruit to ELIO and ANNELLA below.

DISSOLVE TO

EXT. PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 29

OLIVER arrives on his bike from town, wearing the blue
bathing suit and the blue billowy shirt he had when he first
arrived. The house is quiet and deserted on a Saturday
afternoon.

INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 30

ELIO is on his bed wearing only a bathing suit. His right
hand is down inside his swim suit. He is tense, expectant,
alert to every sound. There are footsteps just outside his
door. OLIVER, shirtless, enters the room from the bathroom.
ELIO quickly pulls his bathing suit higher with a jerking
movement as if caught in an embarrassing position.

OLIVER
Why aren’t you with the others at
the river?

ELIO is speechless, out of breath, says:

ELIO
I’m... I’m... I have... an allergy.

OLIVER
Me too. We might have the same one.

ELIO shrugs. A beat.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Want to go for a swim? Just the two
of us?

ELIO
(still out of breath)
Later, maybe.

OLIVER
(extending his hand)
Let’s go now.

ELIO grabs his hand and turns on his side facing the wall,
away from OLIVER, to prevent him from seeing his confusion -
but in his movement is also a slight tugging which could have
pulled OLIVER down on the bed.

ELIO
Must we?

OLIVER straightens up, pauses again to look down, and still
grasping Elio’s hand, succeeds in pulling him upright.
31

32

21.

OLIVER
I’m going to change. What about
you?

He leaves Elio’s room. ELIO puts his hand - the one Oliver
had been holding - down inside his bathing suit, finds it
damp, pulls it out, then hits his forehead with his fist
saying: “Stupid! Stupid!”

He strips off the trunks and, naked and defiant, goes out
into the bathroom while grabbing a new pair of trunks.

INT. ELIO’S AND OLIVER’S BATHROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNGUN

ELIO, while wearing his swimsuit, gets a glimpse of OLIVER
naked in his room.

OLIVER
(calling out as he gets
into his bathing suit)
See you downstairs!

INT. STAIRCASE/BOCCHIRALE - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 32

OLIVER comes down the stairs of the house followed by ELIO.
They are surprised to find CHIARA and MARZIA there. OLIVER
isn’t wearing any shirt and CHIARA makes a ball of the
billowy blue shirt he’d been wearing earlier and tosses it at
him. He puts it over the head of a bronze bust of Elio’s
grandmother.

CHIARA
Enough now. We’re going to the
river and you’ re coming.

There are a number of Professor Perlman’s loose papers lying
on a chair in the bocchirale [hallway]. OLIVER starts
gathering them up.

OLIVER
Let me sort these papers out. Or
his father will skin me alive.

CHIARA
(in French)
En parlant de peau, approche.
(Talking about skin, come here.)

She goes up to him and with her fingernails gently and slowly
tries to pull a sliver of peeling skin from his tanned
shoulder. ELIO watches with envy, wishing he was the one
doing that.
22.

CHIARA (CONT’D)
Tell his father that I crumpled his
papers. We'll see what he says
then..

He takes the Perlman papers to the study. While he’s gone
CHIARA looks at Oliver’s manuscript lying on the chair.

CHIARA (CONT’D)
(shouting)
I could do a better job translating
than whoever this is.

OLIVER
(returning)
Do you type good too?

CHIARA
I type good.

OLIVER
As good as you speak good?

CHIARA
Bettah. And I’d give you a bettah
price too. Stand still.

She pulls another patch of skin off his shoulder. As she’s
doing this he stands very close to her.

OLIVER
I need five pages translated per
day, to be ready for pickup every
morning.

Looking up at him.

CHIARA
Then I won’t do nu’in for you.
Don’t move.
(she extracts another
patch from his arm)
Find yuh-sef somebuddy else.

She drops the bits of peeled-off skin into a plant.

MARZIA
(in French)
Allons nous baigner.
(Let’s go swimming.)

ELIO
Yeah, come on.

He hands OLIVER his sunglasses and hands him the red edition
of Lucretius, it was lying on a table and never leaves his
side.
33

23.

OLIVER
(mumbled to Elio)
Thanks, Buddy.

There is an intimacy in these actions that ELIO both enjoys
and slightly flaunts. In return, CHIARA takes Oliver’s arm to
move him through the door, leaving the other two to follow.
As he leaves, OLIVER puts on his blue shirt.

EXT. RESTAURANT WITH DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 33

A restaurant bar with an open air dancing floor. Everyone
dances. CHIARA does her sexy dancing for OLIVER, who is
enjoying himself and is a very good dancer. The music is
“Paris Latino” by Bandolero.

ELIO goes back to their table with MARZIA and one or two of
the others. He watches CHIARA and OLIVER on the little dance
floor. She moves her thighs in between his. Their moves are
not the moves of people who stop at heavy petting.

MALE FRIEND # ONE
Ma ci sta provando? (Is he hitting
on her?)

MALE FRIEND # TWO
Ha gid cuccato? (Are they doing it,
then?)

ELIO
Che ne so. (I don’t care.)

MALE FRIEND # ONE
Quanto vorrei essere nei suoi
panni. (I'd love to be in his
shoes.)

FEMALE FRIEND # ONE
(to Marzia)
Chi non vorrebbe essere nei panni
di lei, piuttosto.. (Who wouldn’t
want to be in her shoes, I say..)

ELIO watches them dancing, thinks he’d give anything to be in
her shoes. MARZIA studies the look on his face. He pretends
to like watching them dance together.

MARZIA
(to EVERYONE)
Lo vuole a tutti i costi, eh.
(She’s really after him, that’s
clear.)

The music changes, “Love my way” by Psychedelic Furs hits the
dance floor. At the sound of this song OLIVER changes his way
of dancing to a more self-obsessed style. A perfect new-wave
style.
34

24.

They all watch OLIVER’s solo act with surprise and amusement.
ELIO looks at him, mesmerized, until MARZIA pulls him back on
the dance floor. There is a strange energy and exchange of
glances between them.

Elio chooses not to be embarrassed and lets loose with a
sharp little solo of his own. The others applaud. Close on
Marzia amused.

EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 34

ELIO and MARZIA are at the river. They strip their clothes
off.

MARZIA
(in french)
Tu n'es pas avec moi
parce que tu es faché contre
Chiara?
(You're not with me because you’ re
angry with Chiara?)

ELIO
(in french)
Pourquoi je serais faéché contre
Chiara ?
(Why should I be angry with
Chiara?)

MARZIA

(in french)

A cause de lui.
(Because of him.)

ELIO shakes his head, feigning a puzzled look meant to show
that he can’t begin to guess where she’d gotten such a
notion. They run into the river. They swim and then come
ashore.

MARZIA (CONT’D)
(towelling herself dry
with her sweater)
Retourne-toi. Ne me
regarde pas.
(Turn around. Don’t stare at me.)

She looks the other way while he gets back into his own
clothes. When they are no longer naked he takes her hand and
kisses it on the palm, then kisses the space between her
fingers, then her mouth. She’s slow to kiss him back.

ELIO
(in french)
Retrouvons-nous ici demain soir.
Je serai la avant toi.
(Let’s meet tomorrow night. I’1ll be
here before you.)
25.

MARZIA
(in french)
Ne le dis a personne.
(Just don’t tell anyone.)

35 INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 35

The same night. All the lights are off. ELIO, sleeping in his
bed, is woken up by the sound of Oliver peeing in the
adjoining bathroom - the careless, uninhibited male force of
it. ELIO listens, then stands up and goes towards the door.

36 EXT. GARDEN IN FRONT OF THE KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 36

The next morning. OLIVER shows off his newly acquired talent
with a soft-boiled egg, neatly shearing off the shell. He
looks a bit hung-over, with circles under his eyes.

ELIO
(in something of an antic
mood we haven’t seen
before, self-mocking)
We almost did it. Marzia and me.

PERLMAN
(from behind his paper,
and raising his eyebrows)
And why didn’t you?

ELIO
Dunno.

OLIVER
(half-comforting, half-
mocking)
Better to have tried and failed...

ELIO
All I had to do was find the
courage to reach out and touch, she
would have said yes.

OLIVER
(seemingly off-hand)
Try again later.
ANNELLA comes in and while she is seating herself, asks:

ANNELLA
Try later, what?

PROFESSOR PERLMAN and OLIVER laugh, then the Professor
changes the subject.
37

26.

PERLMAN
(to OLIVER)
I just heard from the people in
Sirmione, they say they’ve come up
with something. I’m going there
today, would you like to go with
me?

OLIVER
I’d like that very much.

ELIO
Can’t I come too?

PERLMAN
On condition that you remain
silent.

OLIVER
(teasing)
Silent as in too many opinions on
things, or silent as in Security:
not telling anybody what fabulous
things have been dug up?

PERLMAN
Nothing is being dug up. It’s what
has been brought up - out of the
water.

OLIVER looks awed.

EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 37

Later. ANCHISE is wiping the windshield of the Perlmans’ car.
ELIO comes out just as CHIARA arrives on her bike. She asks
him where Oliver is.

ELIO

(in French)
On va au lac de Garde
avec mon pére. Il veut montrer 4
Oliver l'endroit ot ils draguent.
(We’ re going to Lake Garda with
dad. He wants to show Oliver where
they’ re dredging.)

CHIARA is disappointed.

CHIARA
(in French)
Dis-lui que je suis passée.
(Tell him I came by.)
27.

ELIO

(in French)
Il est a4 l'intérieur, il aide mon
pére. Tu étais incroyable sur la
piste, hier soir.
(He’s inside helping dad. You were
great on the dance floor last
night.)

CHIARA
(in French)
Il danse trés bien.
(He dances great.)

ELIO
(in French)
Et il est beau aussi, non?
(And he’s great looking, isn’t he?)

CHIARA
(in French)
Tu veux jouer les entremetteurs?
(What are you trying to do, fix us
up?)

She leaves him and goes into the house. ELIO gets in the back
seat of the car and waits. Then OLIVER and CHIARA come out.
They speak for a moment, standing close. She kisses him on
the cheek, then gets on her bike and takes off.

OLIVER gets into the front seat of the car, but ELIO tells
him to sit in the back.

ELIO
Dad always sits up front with
Anchise to navigate.

OLIVER gets in the back next to ELIO. He watches CHIARA
riding away.

ELIO (CONT’D)
She seems to like you a lot - She’s
more beautiful than she was last
year.
OLIVER doesn’t respond.
ELIO (CONT’D)
I saw her naked on a night swim.
She has a great body.
OLIVER turns to look at ELIO, surprised.

OLIVER
Are you trying to make me like her?

While talking their bare legs briefly collide.
38

39

28.

ELIO
What would be the harm in that?

OLIVER
No harm. Except I like to go at it
alone, if you don’t mind.

There is a long pause as PROFESSOR PERLMAN comes out and
speaks to ANCHISE.

PERLMAN

(to Anchise)
Guido io oggi, non ti preoccupare.
Non fare quella faccia Anchise!
prenditi il pomeriggio libero.
(I think I will drive myself today.
Anchise, don’t be so upset! take
the afternoon off.)

OLIVER
Don’t play at being the good host,
just don’t.

PERLMAN gets in the front seat. As there seems to be a tense
silence behind, he turns around as the engine starts.

PERLMAN
What’s going on, boys? Oliver, come
sit up front and be my navigator.

OLIVER smiles at Elio as if to say: "See?"

INT./EXT. PERLMAN CAR - DAY - LATER 38

PERLMAN drives the car through the countryside, OLIVER has a
map open on his legs. Hot air blows in through all the open
windows. They are silent as the news plays on the radio,
reporting on the P2 Masonic lodge.

ELIO looks outside but his attention is drawn to Oliver’s
neck.

NARRATOR
(ENTRY ON THE FACTS OF THIS ITALIAN
SUMMER 1983)

EXT. SIRMIONE - GROTTE DI CATULLO (VILLA) - DAY 39

PERLMAN, OLIVER and ELIO walk through the magnificent ruins
of the roman villa overlooking Lake Garda, the Grotte di
Catullo (Caves). Perlman is explaining to Oliver that only
part of the archaeological treasures of this area has come to
light.
40

41

42

29.

PERLMAN
The ship went down in 1827 on the
way to the villa of Count Lechi
here on this island.

A delegation of archaeologists is waiting for them. The
senior member rushes up to PERLMAN and greets him. They all
gather in the small beach that is dominated by the ruins.

Perlman is showed with the arm of a statue. He is very
excited.

EXT. SIRMIONE - GROTTE DI CATULLO (BEACH)- DAY 40

A salvage operation is in progress. Some small boats surround
a floating platform. At the center of the platform is a
winch. There are scuba divers and other people all around.

PERLMAN goes in the water and walks through the shallows
towards an inflatable boat that is standing by, ready to take
him to the platform. ELIO is proud of his father and like
Oliver is excited. The professor gestures them to join him.

EXT. FLOATING PLATFORM - LAKE GARDA - DAY 41

PERLMAN, OLIVER, ELIO and other men are on the boat, now next
to the platform.

At the center of the platform below the cable of the winch is
a large opening. A steel cable is lowered into the water and
steadied by the site workers.

The wait. Finally the cable is pulled back up - it pulls an
antique statue out of the water. PERLMAN, edging closer,
watches the operation minutely. A bronze Boxer slowly comes
up through the opening in the platform, secured by the husky
divers, and as it does a chain-metal trap inches underneath
it to prevent it from falling back into the water if
something should go wrong.

The statue, missing its left arm but otherwise intact, is of
an athlete, a boxer, naked, a kind of finger-less glove and
wrist-strap. Like the damaged arm and gloved hand, the statue
is encrusted with the lake water deposits of a century. It is
still possible to admire the beauty of the athlete’s face,
set with enamelled eyes that seem to be staring straight out
through the murky water at his rescuers. A photographer in
fins goes in for a close-up. There is great excitement.

EXT. SIRMIONE - GROTTE DI CATULLO (BEACH) - AFTERNOON 42

Later, back on the beach. The bronze has been dried and
cleaned. PERLMAN is speaking in Italian with the other men
and women who took part in the operation, and who are
analyzing the find.
43

44

30.

ELIO
Dad, why are we only finding him
now?

PERLMAN

A good question. His partner -
they’re a pair - is in the Vatican.
There are four known sets, after
the Praxiteles originals. This
fellow is Number Three. The Emperor
Hadrian had a pair, dug up at
Tivoli, but one of the more
philistine of the Farnese popes
melted them down and had them
recast as a particularly voluptuous
Venus that was traded to Napoleon

later on.
OLIVER

I guess they didn’t need two pairs.
PERLMAN

No..

The sun is setting, casting its last rays on the long-missing
athlete for the first time in more than a hundred years.
Armed Carabinieri assemble to guard it for the night.

PERLMAN (CONT’ D)
Who would like to go for a swim
before we head back?

EXT. WATER - LAKE GARDA - SUNSET 43

They swim in a little cove not far from the rig that pulled
up the bronze Boxer. It is almost dark, with a cloud streaked
sky reflected in the water. The lights on the rig go on,
including a big floodlight. The lake is surrounded by snow
capped mountains.

Treading water, PERLMAN says to ELIO and OLIVER, who are
nearby, and referring to the armed guards left on the
floating platform with the athlete:

PERLMAN
They’ re all such rogues. Our boxer
could be on a plane to the Geneva
antiquities market tonight for all
I know.

They laugh. The moon is beginning to rise over the water.

EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 44

The same moon shines on the water of the river where MARZIA
waits for ELIO, as promised. She looks at her wristwatch.
45

46

47

48

49

31.

EXT. PERLMAN VILLA / MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT 45
The Perlman car reaches the villa and all get out. ELIO runs
around the house to get his bike and wheels it out on to the
road.

ELIO
I have to go!!

The two men smile at Elio's passionate haste.

PERLMAN
Are you going too?

OLIVER
No Prof, I have to work.

PERLMAN
How about a drink to celebrate the
day?

OLIVER

That would be great.

INT. OLIVER’S ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 46

OLIVER is sitting at his desk in his boxer shorts only,
working; only the desk light is on. A lit cigarette between
his fingers. A radio plays some summer music at a low volume.

Oliver wraps up his corrections on a page and marks it: “to
be typed”.

EXT. ROAD / RIVER -— NIGHT 47

ELIO is riding on his bike on the way to the river, trying to
catch his date with Marzia. When he gets there, no one is
waiting. He calls her name. There is a soft sound, little
waves lapping on the river shore. The moon is brighter than
ever and has risen considerably.
NARRATOR
[TBC]

EXT. GARDEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 48
The following day. A thunderstorm and heavy rain dashes the
plants in the garden and pours from the roof spouts.

INT. LIVING ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 49

Inside the villa the three PERLMANS are sitting on a row ona
big couch as the lights flicker.
32.

ANNELLA
Have you seen my Heptameron?

PERLMAN
It must be over there...

ANNELLA finds the book.

ANNELLA
This version is in German, but I’1ll
translate: Ein gut aus sehender
junger Ritter ist wahnsinnig
verliebt in eine Prinzessin. Sie
auch ist in ihn verliebt.
“,..A handsome young knight is
madly in love with a princess. She
too is in love with him...
...obwohl es so scheint, als sei
sie sich nicht vollig ihrer eigenen
Liebe bewusst.
...though she seems not to be
entirely aware of it.
Despite the friendship...
Freundschaft... that blossoms
between them, or perhaps because of
that very friendship, the young
knight finds himself so humbled and
speechless that he is totally
unable to bring up the subject of
his love. One day he asks the
princess point-blank: Ich bitte
euch ratet mir was besser ist...
reden oder sterben. ‘Is it better
to speak or die’.

The lights suddenly all go out in the house; the music from a
long-playing record dies to a stop. There is a shout in the
kitchen, MAFALDA.

ELIO
(still thinking about the
Knight and the princess)
I’d never have the courage to ask
such a question.

PERLMAN

We were your age once. The things
you feel and think only you have
felt, believe me, We’ve suffered
through all of them, and more than
once - some you never get over and
others you’re as ignorant about as
you are today.
50

51

52

33.

ANNELLA
(nodding in agreement)

Make new friends if the old ones
don’t interest you but stop haning
around the house all the time.
Books, books, books, always books,
et toutes ces partitions... (is all
those score books)... play more
tennis, go dancing more often with
Chiara and Marzia - tu les aimes
no? (you like them, don’t you?) Get
to know people...

PERLMAN
Find out why others are so
necessary in life and not just
foreign bodies to be sidled up to.

They have been sitting in near darkness. The rain beats
against the window panes. ANNELLA spreads an afghan over the
knees of the three of them, saying “It’s getting cold in
here”. Just then the lights come back on and the music
resumes. She looks at her son and runs her fingers through
his hair tenderly.

ANNELLA
Fai anche pazzie se devi. (Do crazy
things if you must.) (Fais des

folies, s’il le faut.)

INT. LIVING ROOM / KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 50

The next day. The storm has passed, leaving a coolness. ELIO
is playing the piano. He is immersed in thought, his mind is
elsewhere. He breaks off, gets up, moves from room to room
downstairs. The kitchen is empty as well. It’s the hour of
siesta. Oliver’s bike is missing.

INT. STAIRCASE / CORRIDOR - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 51

ELIO goes back inside and up the stairs very quietly and
along the corridor he shares with Oliver. He approaches
Oliver’s door like a detective looking for clues. He is about
to open it when he hears the sounds of someone coming up the
back stairs; he opens the door to his own room instead, and
walks in.

INT. CORRIDOR / ELIO’S - OLIVER’S ROOM / SHARED BATHROOM - 52
DAY

MAFALDA appears in the corridor, holding the laundry of the
two young men. She brusquely opens Oliver’s door, puts
Oliver’s shorts, socks, handkerchiefs, maybe the blue
“pillowy” shirt, on his dresser. She goes out, then knocks on
Elio’s door.
53

54

55

34.

ELIO says “Avanti” and she goes in with a pile of the same
sort of clothes belonging to him. He’s lying on his bed,
pretending to read a book. She leaves; he can hear her
retreating footsteps. When she is safely gone he stealthily
goes into Oliver’s room through the bathroom they share. He
looks around Oliver’s room.

INT. OLIVER’S ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 53

He goes to the little pile of laundry and examines it, sees
the folded boxer shorts (or Jockey) - passes his finger tips
over them, then goes to the closet. Hanging on a hook is the
red bathing suit. He picks it up - it’s dry - and brings it
to his face. He rubs his face inside it, smelling it, looks
inside it as if searching for something, kisses every inch of
it, licks the inside of the supporter as if trying to finda
taste of Oliver.

ELIO quickly slips out of his own bathing suit and pulls on
Oliver’s. He undoes Oliver’s bed and gets into it, putting
the pillow over his face and kissing it savagely, smelling it
again and again, searching for Oliver’s scent, then wraps his
bare legs around it.

Suddenly he hears the sound of a bicycle approaching goes to
look out the window. He can just partly see OLIVER leaving
his bike by a wall and coming in the villa. Elio removes
Oliver’s trunks and tidies up the bed, exiting the room.

INT. CORRIDOR (1ST FLOOR) - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 54

ELIO runs towards the window at the end of the corridor and
looks down from it. No one. Finally Oliver appears going down
the steps and moving towards the stone trough. Elio runs to
the stairs and goes down to the ground floor.

EXT. ABBEVERATOIO - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 55

Later. ELIO is sitting under the trees with his score book
open. OLIVER sits on the edge of the stone trough with his
feet in the water, he is wearing his straw hat.

ELIO
My mom’s been reading this 16th
century French romance. She read
some of it to my Dada and I the day
the lights went out.

OLIVER
About the knight who doesn’t know
whether to speak or die? You told
me already.

ELIO
Yes.
35.

OLIVER
Well, does he or doesn’t he?

ELIO
Better to speak, she said. But
she’s on her guard. She senses a
trap somewhere.

OLIVER
So does he speak?

ELIO
No, he fudges.

OLIVER
That figures. Listen, I need to
pick up something in town.

ELIO
I’ll go, if you want me to.
Beat.
OLIVER
Let’s go together.
ELIO
Now?
OLIVER
Why, have you got anything better
to do?
ELIO
No.

OLIVER puts some pages of his manuscript into his old frayed
book bag.

OLIVER
So let’s go.

ELIO puts down his fountain pen, closes his score book, and
in doing so knocks a half-full glass of lemonade onto the
grass. It doesn’t break. OLIVER, who is close by, comes over,
picks it up, and puts it back where it was.

ELIO
You didn’t have to.

Creating a little pause before replying, for emphasis.

OLIVER
I wanted to.
36.

56 EXT. PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 56
On the way to the shed to collect their bikes, they pass
ANCHISE, who hands OLIVER his bike with a wry smile. OLIVER
smiles back.

ANCHISE
(Mixture of Italian and
English)
(I straightened the wheel. It took
some doing. I also put air in the
tires.)
OLIVER
Grazie.

ELIO and OLIVER reach the road, where they pause for a
moment. OLIVER pulls up his shirt and pulls down the top of
his shorts to expose a big scrape and bruise on his left hip.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
(showing ELIO his wound)
I fell the other day on the way
back and scraped myself pretty
badly. Anchise insisted on applying
me some sort of witch’s brew. He
also fixed the bike for me.

ELIO leans over closely to see Oliver’s scrape, which is
smeared with a black unguent.

ELIO

Does he give you the creeps?
OLIVER

Who?
ELIO

That’s what my aunt says. Anchise.

OLIVER
(pulling his clothes
together and turning out
on the road)
Of course not. Just a lost soul,
really, like most of us.

57 EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY 57
They arrive on their bikes at the little town square. OLIVER
buys a pack of cigarettes, Gauloises. He lights one up, then
offers one to ELIO.

OLIVER
You want to try one?
37.

ELIO nods and OLIVER cups his hands very near Elio’s face and
lights his cigarette.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Not bad, right?

ELIO
(drawing on it)
Not bad at all. I thought you
didn’t smoke.

OLIVER
I don’t.
(taking another drag)

They walk their bikes towards the little World War I memorial
in the center of the square which is dedicated to the youth
of the town who perished in the Battle of Piave. They pause a
moment to read the plaque.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
World War II? Did the Allies fight
near here?

ELIO
No. This is World War I. You’d have
to be at least eighty years old to
have known any of them.

OLIVER
Is there anything you don’t know? I
never heard of the Battle of Piave.

ELIO looks at OLIVER. He hesitates, then bursts out:

ELIO
I know nothing Oliver. Nothing,
just nothing.

OLIVER
(looking at him steadily
You know more than anyone around
here.

ELIO
If you only knew how little I know
about the things that really
matter.

OLIVER
What things that matter?

ELIO looks him straight in the eye for once, summoning up his
courage:

ELIO
You know what things. By now you of
all people should know.
Silence.

38.

OLIVER
Why are you telling me all this?

ELIO
Because I thought you should know.

OLIVER
(he repeats ELIO’s words
slowly, playing for time
as he considers them)
Because you thought I should know.

ELIO
Because I want you to know
(blurting it out)
Because there is no one else I can
say this to but you.

There is a magnificent view. A tiny bus works its way uphill,
with some bikers struggling behind it. To buy time, OLIVER
turns to look at it before replying:

OLIVER
Are you saying what I think you’re
saying?

ELIO
Yes.

Now that he’s spilled the beans at last, ELIO takes on the
laid-back, mildly exasperated air which the felon has, once
he surrendered to the police, when he confesses how he robbed

the store.

OLIVER looks at ELIO for a long moment, then gestures towards
the shop front where he takes his manuscript to be typed up.

OLIVER
Wait for me here. Don’t go away.

ELIO
(looking at OLIVER with a
confiding smile)
You know I’m not going anywhere.

Two buses stop nearby to unload their passengers - older
women arriving from adjoining villages to shop. ELIO turns to
read the names listed on the monument. OLIVER returns.

OLIVER
(frowning)
They’ ve mixed up my pages and now
they have to retype the whole
thing. So I have nothing to work on
this afternoon. Which sets me back
a whole day. Damn!
58

39.

ELIO looks as if it has been his fault the typist made a
mistake.

ELIO
I wish I hadn’t spoken.

OLIVER
I’m going to pretend you never did.

ELIO
(unfazed)
Does this mean we’re on speaking
terms - but not really?

OLIVER thinks about this.

OLIVER
Look, we can’t talk about such
things, we really can’t.

He slings his bag with its papers around him and the two are
off down hill.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD/SPRINGS - FONTANILI GAVERINE - DAY 58

Now that ELIO has laid his cards on the table, the scenery
and the fine weather buoy his spirits. They ride together on
the empty country road that at this time of day is all for
them. The sun pounds exposed patches along the way, exposing
the undergrowth. Thirsty they stop by a factory. They look
for water and in the factory Oliver is surprised to see a
Mussolini picture hanging on a wall. They laugh.

Later, at another crossroad.

ELIO
Follow me. I’11 show you a spot
visitors have never seen. That is,
if you have time.

ELIO turns off into a little path towards some spring water
ponds surrounded by willow trees. ELIO leans his bike against
one of them, followed by OLIVER.

ELIO (CONT’D)
This is my spot. All mine. I come
here to read. I can’t begin to tell
you the number of books I’ve read
here.

Oliver puts his hands in the water.

OLIVER
It's freezing cold!
40.

ELIO
The spring is in the mountains, the
Alpi Orobie. The water comes
straight down from there.

Oliver freshens up his face with this water.

OLIVER
Do you like being alone?

ELIO
No one likes being alone. But I’ve
learned how to live with it.

OLIVER
Are you always so wise? So very
wise?

ELIO

I’m not wise at all. I told you, I
know nothing. I know books, and I
know how to string words together -
it doesn’t mean I know how to speak
about the things - about the things
that matter most to me.

OLIVER
But you’re doing it now - in a way.

ELIO
Yes, in a way - that’s how I always
say things: in a way.

Staring out
down on the
on the tips
to his feet

at the view so as not to look at him, ELIO sits
grass. OLIVER crouches a few yards away from ELIO
of his toes, as if at any moment he might spring
and go back to the bicycles.

ELIO (CONT’D)

I come here to escape the known
world.

OLIVER

I like the way you say things. Why
are you always putting yourself
down?

ELIO
(shrugging)

I don’t know. So you won’t, I
suppose.

OLIVER

Are you so scared of what others
think? Or what I think?

ELIO shakes

his head. OLIVER waits for ELIO to say something.

He stares at him.
41.

In the silence of the moment, ELIO stares back. It is the
first time ELIO has dared to stare back at OLIVER openly.
Before this moment he has always cast a glance, then looked
away from Oliver’s steely gaze. It is as if, finally, ELIO is
saying to Oliver: This is who I am, this is who you are, this
is what I want. He stares back with an I-dare-you-to-kiss-me
gaze.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
You’re making things very difficult
for me.

ELIO doesn’t back down. Neither does OLIVER.

ELIO
Why am I making things difficult?

OLIVER
Because it would be very wrong.

ELIO
Would?

OLIVER sits down on the grass, then lies down on his back,
his arms under his head, staring at the sky.

OLIVER
Yes, would. I’m not going to
pretend this hasn’t crossed my
mind.

 

ELIO
I’d be the last to know.

OLIVER
Well, it has. There! What did you
think was going on?

ELIO
Going on? Nothing...nothing.

After a long silence:

OLIVER
I see. You've got it wrong, my
friend - if it makes you feel
better, I have to hold back. It’s
time you learned to do that too.

Each leaning on one arm, both stare out at the view.
OLIVER (CONT’D)

You're the luckiest kid in the
world.
42.

ELIO
(in something of a mocking
tone)
You don’t know the half of it.

OLIVER thinks about this. Then ELIO blurts out:

ELIO (CONT’D)
So much of it is wrong.

OLIVER
What? Your family?

ELIO
That too.

OLIVER

Us, you mean?

ELIO doesn’t reply. OLIVER moves up close to him. Very close.
He stares right in Elio’s face, as though he likes Elio’s
face and wants to study it, linger on it.

OLIVER touches Elio’s lower lip with his finger, lets it
travel left and right, then right and left again. OLIVER
smiles at ELIO as he lies there, and that very smile fills
ELIO with a kind of apprehension about what will happen next.

What happens next is that OLIVER brings his lips to Elio’s
mouth in a warm I’1l-meet-you-halfway-but-no-further kiss, a
conciliatory kiss. ELIO’s return kiss is so famished he loses
himself in it.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
(afterwards)
Better now?

ELIO doesn’t answer. He kisses OLIVER again, lifting his
face, as if to discover more, know more. Even with their
faces touching, their bodies are angles apart. ELIO lifts one
knee as if to face OLIVER.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
I think we should go.

ELIO
Not yet.

OLIVER
We can’t do this - I know myself.
So far we’ve behaved. We’ve been
good. Neither of us has done
anything to feel ashamed of. Let’s
keep it that way. I want to be
good.
59

60

43.

ELIO
Don’t be. I don’t care. Who is to
know?

ELIO reaches for OLIVER in a quick, desperate move, lets his
hand rest on Oliver’s crotch. OLIVER doesn’t move. With total
composure, in a gesture that is both gentle and commanding,
he brings his own hand there, letting it rest on Elio’s fora
second. He twines his fingers into Elio’s, then lifts his
hand. A moment of silence.

ELIO (CONT’D)
(suddenly abashed by his
own action)
Did I offend you?

OLIVER
Just don’t.

He gives Elio his hand and helps him stand up. He pulls up
his shirt to examine the scrape.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
I should make sure it doesn’t get
infected.

ELIO
We can stop by the pharmacist on
the way back.

EXT. ROAD - DAY 59

They glide down the slope on their bikes, with wind in their
hair.

ELIO
We’1ll never speak again, you know..

OLIVER
Don’t say that.

ELIO
I just know it. We’1ll chit-chat,
chit-chat, chit-chat. And the funny
thing is, I can live with that.

OLIVER
You just rhymed.

EXT. GARDEN IN FRONT OF THE KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 60

Lunch. A middle-aged ART HISTORIAN COUPLE have been invited
to lunch. The man is pompous, his wife no less so, dropping
Italian expressions constantly into her conversation. Both

are English. ELIO and OLIVER can hardly keep from laughing.
PERLMAN shoots his son a warning glance.
61

62

44,

Before dessert, as MAFALDA is clearing away the plates, and
as the others are pre-occupied with a conversation about
Antonello da Messina, ELIO feels a warm, bare foot casually
brush his. ELIO, thrilled, waits a few moments before
withdrawing his foot, so as not to give Oliver the impression
he is recoiling in panic.

ELIO’s foot, after a few seconds, begins to seek the other
out. His toe suddenly bumps Oliver’s foot, which had not
moved away.

Without warning, Oliver’s foot at once moves onto Elio’s.
Softly, gently, it begins a caressing motion, never holding
still, but rubbing the arch of Elio’s foot with the smooth
round ball of Oliver’s heel, holding Elio’s foot in place.
The caresses are sometimes tied to the lady art historian’s
more ludicrous comments in Italian, Oliver’s way of
commenting on the pair. But it also is telling Elio that this
is strictly between the two of them, and is a return to the
intimacy of their secret kisses on the grass.

We see the stealthy foot-play. For Oliver it is all fun and
games, punctuating the conversation.

ELIO becomes giddy as MAFALDA serves him ice-cream. As he
begins to eat, it notices red spots appearing on the dessert.
It’s coming from above his head. He realizes that it is
streaming from his nose, that he is having a nosebleed.

ELIO
(covering his nose with
his napkin)
Ghiaccio, ice, Mafalda, per favore,
presto!

OLIVER, astounded, leaps up and hands him his napkin. ELIO
tries to be calm, explains to everyone how "It happens all
the time”. Holding the napkin to his nose to stanch the
stream of blood falling into his dessert, he rises and
leaves.

INT. KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 61

ELIO is in the kitchen looking for ice to stop his nose
bleeding, but the freezer is empty.

INT. BAR - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 62

Later. In a very tight and confined space beside the living
room is the Perlman bar. ELIO is sitting on the floor, his
head tilted back, and is holding a napkin full of ice - now a
mixture of blood and water - on his nose. Beside him is an
ice bucket.

OLIVER
Elio! Where are you?
45.

OLIVER is the bocchirale [hallway], looking for him. Elio
waves from the bar. Oliver goes over to him. ELIO smiles
ruefully.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Was it my fault?

ELIO
I’m a mess, aren’t I?

OLIVER
I guess. The ancients said it never
hurts to be bled from time to time.

ELIO
Sit for a second.

ELIO shifts a little to make room. The place is very tight,
his bare feet touch Oliver's ankles for a moment.

OLIVER takes Elio's feet in his hands and begins massaging
them, pulling on his toes until they crack. ELIO cries out in
mingled pleasure and pain.

ELIO (CONT’D)
Where did you learn to do that?

OLIVER
My Jewish grandmother. She did it
all the time to us.

Elio looks again at Oliver’s necklace with the Star of David
on his chest.

ELIO
I have one of those.

OLIVER
You don’t ever wear it?

ELIO
My mother says we are Jews of
discretion.

OLIVER
I guess that fits your mom...

ELIO
You're going to kill me, you know
that? Ouch!

OLIVER
(giving a final tug to one
of Elio’s big toes, and
getting up)
I hope not.
63

64

46.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Are you going to be okay?

ELIO
I’ll get over it.

OLIVER
Come on, stand up. Lie on the
couch, rest a little. I’11l stick
around.

Oliver helps Elio up.

INT. BOCCHIRALE - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 63

In the bocchirale OLIVER meets the sisters MARZIA and CHIARA.
They’ re giggling.

CHIARA
How is he? Will he live?

OLIVER
I think so. He gave me a scare.
Bleeding all over the dining table.

CHIARA
Really? I’11 be back in a minute.
Don’t go anywhere.

INT. LIVING ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 64

The girls burst into the living room where Elio is lying on
the couch. CHIARA sits at the foot of it, MARZIA stands
peering down at ELIO. He looks up at her a bit sheepishly.

CHIARA takes a cigarette out of a pack and lights it. She
takes a drag on it, then holds it out close to the sole of
Elio’s bare foot. He pulls it up fast.

CHIARA

(in French)
Ca t'a fait mal ? Pourtant,
tu as des pieds de paysan
qui ne sentent rien. Paysan!
(You felt that? You have peasant
feet. They don’t feel things.
Peasant!)

MARZIA
(in French)
Laisse-le tranquille!
(Leave him alone!)

Marzia caresses his hair softly.
65

65A

47.

CHIARA
(in French)
Doucement. Tu vas encore le faire
saigner.
(Easy. You’1l make him bleed
again.)

She holds out her pack of cigarettes to him and he takes one.
She lights it for him and he smokes it. CHIARA looks at him
coolly, as if looking at a rival.

CHIARA (CONT’D)
(in French)

Alors... On sort ou pas?
(So... are we going somewhere?)
ELIO

(in french)
Peut-6tre. Mais si on sort, il ne
faut pas que ma mére me voie, elle
s'inquiéterait.
(regardant autour de lui)
ou est Oliver?
(Maybe. But if I go out my mother
can't see me. She'll get worried.
(looking around)
Where’s Oliver?)

CHIARA
(in french)
Qu’est-ce que j’en sais?
(How would I know?)

EXT. RIVER - AFTERNOON 65

ELIO walks into the fresh water and swims. Down the river is
a group of his FRIENDS playing on the grass, Oliver isn’t
there. Elio is not unhappy. There is a rippling shaft of
sunlight on the water directly towards him. He swims into it.

INT. KITCHEN / PATIO - PERLMAN VILLA - LATER 65A

ELIO makes himself a smoothie in Mafalda’s kitchen, cutting
up a peach, a banana, then a pear, dates. Mafalda wants to do
it for him and tries to take the knife away. To her, a
smoothie is a foreign concoction.

MAFALDA
Faccio io.
(Let me)

ELIO
No, no, faccio da solo.
(No, I’m doing it by myself)
48.

He puts the cut-up fruit into a blender. While the blender
makes the smoothie he glances from the window out in the
garden at ANNELLA sitting on the bench overlooking the south
garden. She is working on a manuscript. He takes the smoothie
out into the garden, it is the last hour of the sun in the
waning day.

He drinks the smoothie, feeling rested. He calls to his
mother.

ELIO (CONT’D)
Est-ce qu’Oliver est la?
(Is Oliver around?)

ANNELLA
N’est il pas sorti?
(Didn’t he go out?)

MAFALDA exits from the kitchen. While ELIO goes to sit with
his mother.

MAFALDA
Signora vuole un frullato pure lei?
(Madame do you want a smoothie
too?)

ANNELLA
No grazie Mafalda, ceniamo tra
poco. (No, thanks Mafalda, we’re
going to dinner)

ELIO
Io esco stasera, non ceno (I’m
going out this evening, I won’t
have dinner)

MAFALDA
Ma dove vai a quest’ora? Mi fai
preoccupare. (But where at this
hour? I worry)

ELIO
Ma di che? (about what?)

MAFALDA
Secondo me non va bene. Signora...
(I'd advise against it)

ANNELLA

(Smiling)
Lasciamolo fare.
(Let’s leave him)

MAFALDA enters the kitchen.
66

67

Revision49.

ANNELLA (CONT’D)
Tu 1l’aimes bien, n’est-ce pas,
Oliver?
(You like him, don’t you? Oliver?)

ELIO
Tout le monde aime Oliver.
(Everyone likes Oliver.)

ANNELLA
Il t’aime bien aussi - plus que
toi, je pense.
(He likes you too - more than you
do, I think.)

ELIO
C’est ton impression?
(Is that your impression?)

ANNELLA
Non c’est celle d’Oliver.
(No, it was Oliver's.)

ELIO
Quand t’a-t-il dit cela?
(When did he tell you that?)

ANNELLA
Il y a un moment.
(A while ago.)

ANNELLA caresses ELIO’s hair. He abruptly stands up. Then
sits down again.

EXT. SOUTH TERRAZZA - PERLMAN VILLA - EVENING 66

After dinner. ELIO is in the terrazza, waiting for Oliver to
return. He tries to read a book but he cannot concentrate. (We
notice that he is now wearing his Star of David.)

INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 67

Late night. ELIO is sitting at his desk, wide awake. He has
left the bathroom door intentionally ajar, hoping that the
light from the foyer might stream in just enough to reveal
his body. As ELIO hears OLIVER step onto the landing in the
hall, he jumps back in his bed pretending to be asleep.

OLIVER walks past Elio’s room without stopping, without even
a hesitation, and goes into his own room and shuts the door.

A few moments later ELIO hears Oliver open the door from his
bedroom into their common bathroom. Then he hears the door
into his own room from the bathroom click shut, as if being
locked. ELIO sits up in bed.
68

Revision50.

ELIO
(to himself, under his
breath)
Traitor. Traitor!

EXT. GARDEN IN FRONT OF THE KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 68

The next day. ELIO is the last to arrive. He pretends to
ignore OLIVER, who is cracking open the top of his soft-
boiled egg. ANNELLA looks at OLIVER in a worried way:

ANNELLA
Guarda un po’ quanto sei pallido.
(How gaunt you look!)

PERLMAN looks up from his paper.

PERLMAN
I pray to God you made a killing
last night, otherwise I’1l have to
answer to your father.

OLIVER
(speaking down into the
messy egg-cracking
business)
I never lose, Pro.

PERLMAN
Does your father approve?

OLIVER
I pay my own way. I’ve paid my way
since high school. My father
couldn’t possibly disapprove.

PERLMAN
Did you have a lot to drink last
night?

OLIVER

(buttering his bread)
That - and other things.

PERLMAN
I don’t think I want to know.

OLIVER
Neither does my father. And to be
perfectly frank, I don’t think I
care to remember myself.

ELIO looks up at this.

PERLMAN
Do you save your winnings?
51.

OLIVER
Save and invest, Pro.

PERLMAN
I wish I’d had your head at your
age; I would have spared myself
many mistaken turns.

OLIVER
Mistaken turns? I can’t picture you
even imagining a mistaken turn.

PERLMAN
That’s because you see me as a
figure, not a human being. Worse
yet: as an old figure. But there
were. Mistaken turns, that is.
Everyone goes through a period of
traviamento - when we take, say, a
different turn in life, the other
via. Dante himself did. Some
recover, some pretend to recover,
some never come back, some chicken
out before ever starting, and some,
for fear of taking any turns, find
themselves leading the wrong life
all life long.

Both young men listen. At the end OLIVER proceeds to crack
another egg. He has big bags under his eyes. He does look
gaunt.

OLIVER
Sometimes the traviamento turns out
to be the right way, Pro. Or as
good a way as any. I know myself.

PERLMAN
(lighting a cigarette, and
nodding)
At your age I knew nothing. But
today everyone knows everything,
and everyone talks, talks, talks.

ANNELLA
Perhaps what Oliver needs is sleep,
sleep, sleep.

OLIVER
Tonight, I promise, Signora P., No
poker, no drinking. I’1l put on
clean clothes, go over my
manuscript, and after dinner we’1ll
all watch TV and play canasta, like
old folks in Little Italy.

ANNELLA sighs melodiously, relieved that Perlman’s words have
convinced him to stay home and rest.
69

52.

She offers Oliver more coffee, tells her seventeen year old
son not to slouch in his chair. MAFALDA brings in some
apricot juice in a chilled silver pitcher.

EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE LAWN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 69

OLIVER is doing some work for Perlman, specify. He seems hard
at work and does not look up as ELIO approaches. ELIO doesn’t
know how to break the silence. Then he sees and kicks the
volleyball lying under the nearby lime trees. The ball hits
Oliver “waking him up” from his work.

ELIO
(despite himself, sounding
peevish)
I waited for you last night.

Oliver throws back the ball at him.

OLIVER
Why didn’t you come into town?

Elio stops the ball.
ELIO
Dunno.

OLIVER
We had a nice time. You would have
too. Did you rest at least? Mafalda
said you went swimming.

ELIO
I was okay. Restless, I guess.

OLIVER goes back to staring at the page he is writing and
mouthing the syllables. Elio kicks the ball again.

ELIO (CONT’D)
Are you headed into town this
morning?

OLIVER
Later, maybe.

ELIO
I was going to head into town
myself.

OLIVER
Ummmm. I see.

ELIO
A book I ordered finally arrived.
70

53.

INT PERLMAN STUDIO - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 70

From inside his studio PERLMAN watches the two boys talking
on the lawn.

EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE LAWN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY (CONT’D) 71

The conversation continues.

OLIVER
I’ll pick it up for you if you
want.

ELIO

It was just that I was hoping we’d
go together.

OLIVER
You mean like the other day?

ELIO

I don’t think we’ll ever do
anything like that again. But yes,
like that.

(beat)
That day belongs to a different
time warp. We should leave sleeping
dogs -

OLIVER listens, now looking at Elio straight in the face.

OLIVER
That voice of wisdom is your most
winning trait. Do you like me that
much, Elio?

ELIO
Do I like you? Do I like you,
Oliver? I worship you.

OLIVER’s face softens. He is touched by Elio’s forthright and
brave avowal.

OLIVER
I’1l go with you but - no speeches.

ELIO
No speeches, not a word.

OLIVER
(gathering his things)
What do you say we grab our bikes
in half an hour?
72

54.

EXT. SPRINGS - FONTANILI GAVERINE - DAY 72

The vital, pure, and joyful sight of a fresh water spring,
the unstoppable stream gushing out from earth.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Two young men travelling by bike,
riding into town and back... They
swam, played volley-ball, ate,
drank, and late at night ran into
each other on the very same
piazzetta where two mornings before
so much - but actually nothing -
was said between them. Oliver was
with a girl, Elio also was with a
girl. If he hadn't messed things up
with his dramatics, Elio could have
enjoyed this for its own sake.
Every day they could have ridden
into town and back, and even if
that was all Oliver was willing to
give Elio, he would have taken it.

OMITTED 73

EXT. STREETS OF CREMA - DAY 74
ELIO and OLIVER walk their bikes along the streets of Crema.

ELIO stops and gives a book to OLIVER, who opens it and reads
what he has written.

OLIVER
Zwischen Immer und Nie... (For you
in silence, somewhere in Italy in
the mid-eighties). This is the best
present I’ve received all year.

ELIO
I’m glad then. I just wanted to...
(lightly)
I know - no speeches. Ever.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - FONTANILI GAVERINE - DAY 75

On the return ride, ELIO ignores the turn to “his place”, i
Fontanili. OLIVER, on the other hand, recognizes it, and as
he passes sees the pathway disappearing into the trees.
Oliver’s POV of the path.
76

77

55.

EXT. SOUTH TERRAZZA - PERLMAN VILLA - SUNSET 76

The PERLMANS are sitting having a drink at sundown. They are

joined by OLIVER, his hair glistening and slicked back after

his late afternoon shower. He makes himself a light drink and
eases back into his chair with a sigh of content. His ‘star’

look beams all over his features.

ANNELLA
Our muvi star...

OLIVER
I’ll miss all this, Mrs. P.

ANNELLA
And we will certainly miss you.

PERLMAN

You must think of this place as
your second home - or third, or
fourth, whatever. But the welcome
mat will definitely be out

(to ELIO, who has just

strolled in).)
Isn’t that true?

ELIO
(cautiously)
Any time...
ANNELLA

Ennnnnni taaim...

PERLMAN
How is the work going?

OLIVER
It’s going.

PERLMAN
Planning to go into town tonight?

OLIVER
Not tonight. Maybe tomorrow.

PERLMAN
No poker either?

OLIVER smiles and shakes his head.

INT. KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 77

Later, after dinner. MAFALDA is cleaning up the kitchen.
ELIO, restless, comes in and goes to the fridge, scoops up
some ice cream into a bowl, and goes outside, eating as he
walks.
78

56.

EXT. GARDEN - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 78

ELIO stands in the garden with the bowl of ice cream and
looks up at Oliver’s window. There is a faint glow, like that
of a desk lamp. A red bathing suit is drying.

From inside we hear the sound of the Perlmans’ television.

INT. LIVING ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 719

ELIO, restless, uncharacteristically idle, sits down with his
parents to watch tv. The news on tv talk about the first
socialist government presently taking power in Italy, under
the guide of Bettino Craxi. ELIO half watches. He lights a
cigarette.

ANNELLA
(engrossed)
Not in here!

ELIO gets up and goes into his father’s study, to his desk,
at the telephone. He dials Marzia’s number and she answers.

MARZIA (VOICE)
(in French, there is a
flatness of tone)
Tu es encore malade?
(Are you still sick?)

ELIO

(in French)
C'était rien. Tu veux sortir ? Je
peux passer te prendre en vélo, on
peut aller...
(It was nothing. Do you want to go
out? I can come on my bike and pick
you up. We can go to...)

MARZIA
(in French)
OK, je viens.
(Yeah. I’11l come.)

OMITTED 80

EXT. STREETS - CREMA - NIGHT 81

Elio and Marzia are wheeling their bikes through the town
streets. Elio sees a bookstand and asks Marzia to hold his
bicycle. We stay with Marzia who sees Elio feverishly browse
through the stand. He finds something he likes and buys it.
Returns to her and gives her the book.

On impulse, ELIO kisses MARZIA behind the ear. She seems to
freeze. He kisses her again and whispers:

ELIO
Ca t’a dérangé?
(Did it bother you?)

MARZIA
(whispering back, in
French)

Bien sir que non.
(Of course not.)

82

EXT. STREETS/PIAZZA PREMOLI - CREMA - NIGHT 83

Outside in the street. They converse as they walk in French.

MARZIA
Pourquoi tu m’as acheté ce livre?
(Why did you buy me this book?)

ELIO
Parce que j'en avais envie.
(Because I felt like it.)

MARZIA
Oui, mais pourquoi tu l'as acheté
pour moi?
Pourquoi m'acheter un livre 4 moi?
(Yes but why did you buy it for me?
Why buy me a book?)

ELIO
Je comprends pas ta question.
(I don’t understand what you’re
asking.)

MARZIA
N’importe qui comprendrait pourquoi
et toi tu ne comprends pas!
(An idiot would understand why I’m
asking but you don’t.)

ELIO
Je te suis toujours pas.
(I still don’t follow.)

MARZIA
Tu es désespérant.
(You’ re hopeless.)

ELIO
Si tu ne me le dis pas, je vais
imaginer des choses...

(MORE)
58.

ELIO (CONT'D)
(If you don’t tell me, I’11 imagine
all sort of things...)

MARZIA
Sei un coglione. (Tu n'es qu'un
crétin) Donne-moi une cigarette.
(Give me a cigarette.)

They are walking very slowly, wheeling their bikes. There are
frequent bursts of sound from behind shuttered windows: TVs,
family arguments, music.

MARZIA (CONT’D)
Tu lis vraiment autant que ¢a ?
Je veux direi: moi aussi,
j'aime lire, mais je ne le dis a
personne. (Do you really read that
much? Don’t get me wrong. I like to
read, too. But I don’t tell
anyone.)

ELIO
Pourquoi tu ne le dis pas?
(Why don’t you tell anyone?)

MARZIA
Je ne sais pas... Les gens qui
lisent sont cachottiers. Ils
cachent ce qu'ils sont vraiment.
Les gens qui cachent n'aiment pas
toujours ce qu'ils sont.
(I don’t know.. People who read are
hiders. They hide who they are.
People who hide don’t always like
who they are.)

They wheel their bikes in the direction of Piazza Premoli, a
beautiful town square dominated by a marvellous 18th century
palazzo.

ELIO
Tu caches qui tu es vraiment?
(Do you hide who you are?)

MARZIA
Parfois. Pas toi?
(Sometimes. Don’t you?)

ELIO
Si, sarement. Tu le fais avec moi
aussi?
(I suppose. Do you hide from me?)
59.

MARZIA
Non, pas avec toi. Ou si, peut-
étre, un petit peu.
(No, not from you. Or maybe, yes, a
bit.)

ELIO
Comment ca?
(Like what?)

MARZIA
Tu sais trés bien ce que je veux
dire.
(You know exactly like what.)

ELIO
Pourquoi tu dis ca?
(Why do you say that?)

MARZIA
Pourquoi? Parce que je pense
que tu peux me faire souffrir
et que je ne veux pas souffrir.
(Why? Because I think you can hurt
me and I don’t want to be hurt.)

She thinks for a moment.

MARZIA (CONT’D) Pas
parce que tu cherches 4 blesser,
mais parce que tu changes toujours
d'avis, alors, on ne sait donc
jamais a quoi s'en tenir. Tu
m'effraies. (Not that you mean to
hurt anyone, but because you’ re
always changing your mind, so no
one knows where to find you. You
scare me.)

ELIO leans over in one of their pauses and kisses MARZIA
lightly on the lips. She stops by the gate of Palazzo
Premoli.

MARZIA (CONT’ D)
Tu m'embrasses encore?
(Kiss me again?)

Once they are close, he holds her face with both hands and
leans into her as they begin to kiss, his hand going up under
her shirt, hers goes in his hair. They enter the Palazzo
courtyard and enter a dimly lit corner. Her hips respond to
his, without inhibition. There is nothing between their
bodies but their clothes. She slips a hand between them and
down into his trousers.

MARZIA (CONT’D)

(in a surprised tone)
Comme tu es dur!
(You’ re so hard.)

He tries to speak, tells her “You’re making me harder” - but
she cuts him off.
MARZIA (CONT’D)
Embrasse-moi encore.
(Kiss me again.)
He does so.
MARZIA (CONT’D)
Ma tu mi vuoi veramente bene? (Tu
tiens vraiment a moi?) (Do you
really care for me?)
She is frank, human, vulnerable, eager to confide. She keeps
her hand down in his pants as they kiss more passionately,
and his hands stray all over her body.
EXT. RIVER - NIGHT 84
A deserted spot on the river, later. MARZIA and ELIO make
love on the grass. He pulls out just in time and ejaculates
on her belly. They burst out laughing.
ELIO
Je suis désolé! Je suis désolé!
(I’m sorry! I’m sorry...)
INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAWN 85
Later. It is now dawn. ELIO is in his room sitting naked at
his desk. His small lamp is on. He takes up a school notebook
and tears out a page. He begins writing the note to Oliver:
Please don’t avoid me.
He crumples that up.
Please don’t avoid me. It kills me.
He crumples that up too, and writes:

Your silence is killing me.

He says to himself, out loud,
ELIO

Way over the top.

He writes:
86

61.

Can’t stand thinking you hate me.
He tears that up too, and tries again:

I’d sooner die than know you hate
me.

He laughs, tears that one up, and writes once more:

Can’t stand the silence. I need to
speak to you.

He reads this, liking it. He lifts his right hand to his
face, smells his fingertips, his palm, then his other hand
liking that too.

ELIO gets up, folds the last note, and slips it under the
door that separates his room from Oliver’s.

EXT. GARDEN IN FRONT OF THE KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 86

Breakfast. PROFESSOR PERLMAN sits behind his newspaper, while
a very sleepy ELIO cracks his egg.

OLIVER walks in, sits down, and without looking at ELIO,
says:

OLIVER
Did you enjoy yourself last night?

ELIO
Insomma (so-so).

PERLMAN
(from behind his paper)
Must be tired then. Or were you
playing poker too?

ELIO
(busy with his egg)
I don’t play poker.

PERLMAN and OLIVER exchange glances.

PERLMAN
Several hundred color slides of our
boxer and the others like him
arrived yesterday from Berlin. We
should start cataloging them. That
will keep us busy until lunch I
imagine.

Revisioné2.
INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 87

ELIO enters his room. He sees the folded note he wrote to
Oliver lying on his desk and opens it. Oliver has added:

Grow up. I’11 see you at midnight.

ELIO feels weak-kneed and has to sit down on his bed. He
kisses the slip of paper, then holds it against his heart.
Then he looks at the time on his watch: 10:30 AM.

INT. PROFESSOR PERLMAN’S STUDY - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 88

OLIVER and PROFESSOR PERLMAN project images of classical
athletes in his study. On the screen is a close-up detail of
a bronze navel in an impressively muscled stomach. There are
several of these, and PERLMAN points out stylistic
differences:

PERLMAN
(pointing at the images)
Beautiful aren’t they?

OLIVER
They’re amazing. But these are far
more... sensual.

PERLMAN

Because these are more Hellenistic
than fifth-century Athenian, most
likely sculpted under the influence
of the greatest sculptor in
antiquity: Praxiteles. Their
muscles are firm- look at his
stomach for example- and yet never
a straight body in these statues,
they are all curves, sometimes
impossibly curved and so
nonchalant, hence their ageless
ambiguity. As if they’re daring you
to desire them.

OLIVER, not unmoved by these images, grins, pats his own
belly and sucks in.

EXT. TABLE UNDER THE LIME TREES - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 89

At the lunch table. A clock strikes two. Lunch is over and
everyone folds his napkin and pushes back their chairs.

ANNELLA
And don’t forget Mr. Keller and Mr.
Hodell are coming for dinner
tonight.

ELIO
(to Oliver)
Otherwise known as Laurel and
Hardy.

PERLMAN
(gently admonishing)
Okay...

ANNELLA
I want you to wear the shirt they
gave you for your birthday. It
will make them happy.

ELIO
It’s way too big on me. It looks
ridiculous.

Elio turning to OLIVER to bring him into the conversation and
to test his mood.

ELIO (CONT’D)
See if Oliver doesn’t think I look
like a scarecrow in it. I’11 model
it for you.

But OLIVER is non-committal and won’t be drawn into the
decision.

ELIO can’t help glancing at his wrist watch, but attempts to
hide the gesture from OLIVER by reaching out for an uneaten
cookie on a plate just as MAFALDA is removing it. Then, to
tease ELIO:

OLIVER
What's the time?

Oliver reaches for Elio’s wrist, But Elio pulls away and runs
up the stairs.

INT. KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 90
MAFALDA is cleaning up after lunch. OLIVER comes in.

OLIVER
(in his halting Italian)
Mafalda, non sar6 con voi a cena
stasera. (I won’t be home for
dinner this evening).

EXT. ABBEVERATOIO - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 91

By the abbeveratoio. ELIO is asleep, his face resting on his
hand. MARZIA arrives on her bike just as OLIVER leaves on
his. They pause in the road to say hello. MARZIA continues
towards the house and approaches the sleeping ELIO.

She plants a light kiss on his forehead, waking him up. He
darts a look at his watch: three fifty-five.

Later. MARZIA and ELIO are in the abbeveratoio. She slips her
hand inside his bathing suit and takes hold of him like she
did in the street the night before.

MARZIA (IN FRENCH)
Tu ne bandes pas.
(You aren’t hard.)

ELIO (IN FRENCH)
Ne fais pas ca ici.
(Don’t do that here.)

MARZIA (IN FRENCH)
Montons dans ta chambre.
(Let’s go up to your room.)

ELIO (IN FRENCH)
J'ai une meilleure idée.
(I have a better idea.)

INT. KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 92
ELIO and MARZIA, in their swimsuits, run through the kitchen.

Elio holds her hand, almost dragging her. They haven't dried
up, and are wetting the floor as they go.

INT. STAIRCASE/CORRIDOR (1ST FLOOR) - PERLMAN VILLA - 93
AFTERNOON

ELIO and MARZIA go up the stairs that take to the upper floor
of the building.
MARZIA
(riant)
On va ou???
(laughing)
(Where are we going???)

They enter a small door on the left end of the corridor.

INT. SMALL SPIRAL STAIRCASE - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 94
A small and narrow spiral staircase. ELIO jogs up the steps
with MARZIA.

INT. ATTIC - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 95

ELIO and MARZIA enter the attic, it is filled with old
furniture, books, and other unused stuff.
96

97

65.

Elio moves a mattress that was leaning on the wall and lays

it on the ground. They pull off their bathing suits and lie

on the mattress, ELIO on top. He takes off his watch, places
it on a bed-side table, where he can see it. It is 4:29.

The windows are open, but the shutters are half closed. The
subdued afternoon light draws slatted patterns on the bed, on
the wall, on MARZIA and ELIO making love.

EXT. PERLMAN VILLA - LATE AFTERNOON 96

MARZIA leaves just before dinner time. ELIO comes down with
her as the evening guests pull up in their car: a GAY COUPLE
one tall and thin, the other short and rotund. Both are
professors on holiday, and both are wearing purple shirts.
Each carries a bouquet of white flowers which they present to
ANNELLA. ELIO introduces them to MARZIA. They speak terrible
Italian, one starting a sentence loaded with compliments, the
other having to finish it. ELIO leads them into the house as
MARZIA bikes off.

INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - EVENING 97

ELIO finds his father in his room going through all his son’s
shirts hanging in the closet in order to pick out the
unwanted present. He hands it to ELIO, who groans.

ELIO
I can’t put it on now! They’ve
already met me. It will look like a
put-up job.

PERLMAN

(in a very amused tone)
No misbehaving tonight. When I tell
you to play, then play! You’re too
old not to accept people as they
are. What’s wrong with them? I
don’t think it’s very attractive of
you to call them ‘Laurel and Hardy’
behind their backs...

ELIO
Mom called them that.

PERLMAN
...and then accept gifts from them.
Is it because they’re gay or
because they’re ridiculous? Is that
it? I hope not. And if you know as
much about economics when you’ re
Zafar’s age you’1l be a very wise
man indeed and a credit to me. Now
get into this.
98

The shirt isn’t so bad: a loose Hawaiian one with big white
flowers on a black background. ELIO changes into it.

EXT. TABLE UNDER THE LIME TREES - PERLMAN VILLA - EVENING 98

ELIO bounds into the living room, where PERLMAN is serving
LAUREL and HARDY champagne, making something of an entrance.
They rise and salute him with their glasses, exclaiming and
exchanging delighted glances as their host’s beautiful son
descends in their midst wearing the shirt they had given him.
PERLMAN and ANNELLA look at ELIO for a moment, as if seeing
him anew, then pour out a glass of champagne for him. On the
table in front of them are a number of big black and white
photographs of the bronze Boxer being pulled up out of the
water.

INT. LIVING ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - LATER 99

ELIO is playing the piano. For his final selection, he has
chosen a piece by Poulenc. The others listen almost
reverently. His wristwatch is on the piano.

As he is concluding, OLIVER comes in from outside and makes
his way towards the stairs. The others turn as he passes. He
smiles in greeting, and makes “I don’t want to disturb you”
motions with his hands before disappearing. ELIO is
unperturbed. The sudden appearance of OLIVER may inject a
dash of fire to the final - if wee-bit hurried - notes.

ELIO stands up as his audience applauds and makes a little
bow.

ELIO
(nodding in appreciation)
I’m afraid I have to go to bed now.

He shakes hands with the guests, thanks them anew for his
shirt, kisses his mother, and runs up the stairs. The big
clock shows almost eleven.

INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 100

Later still. ELIO sits at his desk. He has taken off the
Hawaiian shirt and is now wearing a T-shirt. He smokes a
cigarette while he writes in his journal. We see his pen
forming his thoughts.

ELIO breaks off to listen for sounds coming from Oliver’s
room. Dead silence. His watch says a quarter to twelve.
Barefoot, he gets closer to the door that separates the two
rooms. He looks through the cracks but sees no light. He
returns to his post.

He glimpses himself in the mirror and says to his reflection:
“Do I know you?”.
101

102

103

104

67.

He turns his face from side to side to catch different
lights. He goes at the bathroom door to listen, but there are
no sounds from inside.

INT. OLIVER’S ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 101

OLIVER is lying fully dressed on his bed, in the dark,
smoking a cigarette. A half-full ashtray is resting on the
pillow next to him. His espadrilles lie on the floor where he
kicked them off. Oliver’s expression is enigmatic compared to
Elio’s, calmness itself. He hears Elio run the tap in their
adjoining bathroom and looks up.

INT. ELIO’S AND OLIVER’S BATHROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 102

In the bathroom ELIO pees. He’s careful not to make any noise
and aims high. He says softly, looking down at his penis, “Do
I know you?” He flushes the toilet and turns off the tap.

INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 103

When ELIO emerges from the bathroom he hears voices coming up
from below as the guests are leaving. He reaches the window
and looks down at “Laurel and Hardy” who stand by the car
saying their goodbyes and laughing affectionately. The two
men get into their car, the PERLMANS waving as it drives
away.

Right in that moment ELIO rises his gaze and sees OLIVER on
the balcony above the main entrance.

INT. CORRIDOR/EXT. BALCONY - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 104

ELIO runs into the corridor and reaches the balcony where
OLIVER is smoking.

OLIVER
I’m glad you came. I could hear you
moving in your room and for a while
I thought you were getting ready to
go to bed, had changed your mind.

ELIO
Change my mind? Of course I was
coming.

ELIO steps close to the ledge.

ELIO (CONT’D)
So you do smoke?

OLIVER
Sometimes.
105

68.

ELIO
(not knowing what else to
say)
I’m nervous.

OLIVER
Me too.

ELIO
I am more so.

INT. OLIVER’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 105

OLIVER sits on the bed, his legs crossed, looking smaller,

younger. ELIO stands awkwardly at the foot of the bed, not

knowing what to do with his hands. He keeps putting them in
his pockets, then taking them out again.

 

OLIVER
(placing the full ashtray
onto the floor)
Come, sit.

Hestitating, ELIO crawls onto the bed and sits facing him,
cross-legged like Oliver, making sure their knees don’t
touch. Needing suddenly to shed his shyness and inhibitions,
ELIO decides he has to lean against something and slides up
to the top of the bed, resting his back against the headboard
beside OLIVER.

ELIO looks down at the bed and at the two of them side by
side on it, a moment he has dreamed of. Now here we are, he
thinks, hardly able to believe it. As if to highlight that
moment, OLIVER stretches his legs out, his bare feet next to
ELIO’s own.
OLIVER (CONT’D)
You okay?

ELIO
Me okay.

With his toes, ELIO reaches over to Oliver’s toes and touches
them. He slips his big toe in between Oliver’s big toe and
his second toe. OLIVER does not respond. Since he is sitting
on Oliver’s left he figures these are not the toes that
touched him at lunch the other day. It was his right foot
that was guilty, so ELIO tries to reach it with his own right
foot, in a kind of desperately playful mood.

OLIVER
What are you doing?

ELIO
Nothing.
69.

Somewhat absentmindedly, awkwardly and without conviction,
OLIVER reciprocates the movement, seeking out Elio’s other
foot. ELIO moves closer to OLIVER, then hugs him. A kind of
child’s hug, which OLIVER responds to only by saying, half-
humorously:

OLIVER
That’s a start.

ELIO shrugs, not wanting to speak.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Does this make you happy? You
aren’t going to have a nosebleed
are you?

It does, and ELIO nods yes, then no. Finally, OLIVER brings
his arm around ELIO. He doesn’t stroke him, doesn’t hold him
tight. ELIO loosens his own hold for a moment, giving him
time enough to bring both his hands, seeking skin, under
Oliver’s loose shirt and resume his embrace.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
You sure you want this?

ELIO nods again, Yes.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
We haven’t talked.

ELIO shrugs his shoulders, meaning "No need to."

OLIVER lifts Elio’s face with both hands and stares at him
the way he did on the cliff, even more intensely.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Can I kiss you?

Then he suddenly pulls back, as if he might laugh, and runs
his fingers through Elio’s hair, messing it up.

ELIO brings his mouth to Oliver’s in a fiercely eager kiss.
Something seems to clear away between them, and both abandon
themselves to the kiss. ELIO hungrily kisses Oliver’s closed
eyes, his nose, his ears, his throat, discovering them with
his lips. OLIVER kisses him back as eagerly, even roughly.

ELIO gets under the covers. There are some things lying on
the bed that hadn’t been removed - a book, some magazines, a
pack of cigarettes, and ELIO slips a foot under them as if
they weren’t there; they all fall onto the floor.

OLIVER gets under the covers too and starts to undress ELIO.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
(whispering)
Off, and off, and off, and off...
(tossing them away
70.

ELIO is soon naked and lies back under the sheet in a kind of
ecstasy as OLIVER moves his hands over his body, as
inquisitive as Marzia’s had been the night before in the
street. When OLIVER pulls the sheet back, ELIO loves being
naked before him. No secrets. OLIVER kisses him, kisses his
body, takes his penis (off-screen) briefly in his mouth, then
returns to kiss Elio’s open lips again more deeply, as if he
too is finally letting go. OLIVER is also naked, and not a
part of him isn’t touching ELIO now. They stare at each
other.

ELIO looks away, because OLIVER is staring at him. Then he
looks back, and now stares at OLIVER, as they settle into a
mock wrestling position with Oliver’s shoulders rubbing
Elio’s knees. ELIO looks into Oliver’s eyes in an intensity
of love and expectation, wanting this moment to last forever,
knowing there will be no coming back from this.

When it happens - when OLIVER enters ELIO - there is a degree
of pain and discomfort. ELIO flinches and fights an impulse
to stop him, which OLIVER sees.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
You’ re okay?

An eternity seems to pass between Elio’s reluctance to make
up his mind and Oliver’s instinct to make it up for him.

They fuck. Bodies are entangled. Elio is flushed, turning
from side to side as he alternates obscenities with Oliver’s
name; Oliver’s face is more implacable, his lips softly
repeating what ELIO says, until he bends forward to say to
him:

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Call me by your name and I’11 call
you by mine.

They continue their rhythm, taking ELIO in a realm he has
never known before, and murmuring his own name as if it were
Oliver’s: Elio... Elio... Elio. The Star of David bounces on
Oliver’s chest.

A LITTLE LATER

OLIVER pulls out and says to ELIO (Oliver) that he is going
to come. ELIO watches the formidably discreet, formidably
cool OLIVER make faces and peak before his very eyes. When he
comes, it’s all over Elio’s chest, saying “I want to! I want
to!”. It is a shock at first when OLIVER spreads his semen
out with the palm of his hand over Elio’s stomach and chest.

OLIVER, still straddling ELIO, picks up his billowy blue
shirt from the floor and cleans him with it.

ELIO
Did we make noise?
106

71.

OLIVER
Nothing to worry about.

ELIO
Mafalda always looks for signs.

OLIVER
She won’t find any.

ELIO
You wore that shirt on your first
day here. Will you let me have it,
leave it here when you go?

OLIVER doesn’t answer and tosses the shirt aside. He takes
ELIO in his arms, looks down into his face. He smooths out
Elio’s hair with his hand. ELIO is falling asleep. OLIVER
continues to hold him.

INT. OLIVER’S ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAWN 106

Dawn. Light is coming in. OLIVER is still cradling ELIO in
his arms but has shifted to a more comfortable position for
them both. ELIO opens his eyes, sees OLIVER looking down at
him but instead of smiling or lifting his face to be kissed,
he closes his eyes again, as if blotting OLIVER, the bed, the
room, and all that has happened out. He tries to sit up,
stretches his limbs, and pulls the sheet over his nakedness.
OLIVER stares at him, as if to register Elio’s morning after
emotions.

OLIVER
You're not happy. You’re feeling
sick about it, aren’t you?

ELIO shrugs the comment away not wanting Oliver looking into
his heart.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
I knew we shouldn’t have. I knew
it. We should have talked.

ELIO
Maybe.

OLIVER
(stung, “maybe” isn’t the
word he wanted to hear
Did you hate it?

ELIO
No, I didn’t hate it at all.

ELIO stays put on Oliver’s bed out of an exaggerated sense of
courtesy. Relenting, he smiles back at OLIVER for the first
time, though he wishes at that moment for OLIVER to be miles
away.
107

108

109

72.

OLIVER
You can go back to sleep, if you
want.

ELIO reaches up and hugs him, then closes his eyes. OLIVER
continues to study his face, his own expression one of
uncertainty. With his eyes still shut, ELIO says, “You’re
staring at me.” But at once he opens them again and sits up,
brushing Oliver’s hand away, and rises gingerly from the bed.

ELIO
Let’s go swimming.

INT. BOCCHIRALE - PERLMAN VILLA - DAWN 107

In the dim light of dawn, OLIVER and ELIO leave the villa on
bikes.

EXT. RIVER - FIRST LIGHT OF DAY 108

At the river, OLIVER walks knee-deep in the water with the
blue shirt on, then dives in and swims away. Elio is swimming
200 meters away, from a distance they look like two complete
strangers.

EXT. RIVER - DAY 109
ELIO and OLIVER walk towards their bikes.

OLIVER
Are you going to hold last night
against me?

ELIO
No.

He said this too swiftly to sound convincing.
INT. STAIRS/ELIO’S ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 110

Back at the villa. There are some sounds from the kitchen but
OLIVER and ELIO succeed to get back home without being seen.
They reach their respective doors and, while ELIO is going
in, OLIVER hesitates before going through his and steps into
Elio’s room instead. ELIO is taken by surprise. OLIVER shuts
the door.

OLIVER
Take your trunks off.

Surprised, ELIO, who doesn’t have it in him at this moment to
disagree, lowers them and gets out of them. He feels awkward.
111

112

Revision73.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Sit down.

ELIO does, and almost before he’s settled, OLIVER brings his
mouth to Elio’s penis and takes it all in (off-screen) .

OLIVER (CONT’D)
(with a wry smile)
Well, this is promising. You’re
hard again. Good.

He jumps up and goes out in an instant. ELIO lifts himself
out of the low chair carefully and pulls on his pajama
bottoms. Then he throws himself across his bed.

EXT. GARDEN IN FRONT OF THE KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 111

Breakfast. The PERLMANS, MAFALDA coming in and out from the
kitchen, ELIO.

Then OLIVER comes in and sits next to him. When no one is
looking, OLIVER slips his smooth foot under Elio’s, as if
snuggling it there, instead of placing it on top as he always
had before. Calmly, he focuses on his soft-boiled egg. They
eat breakfast.

OLIVER
I’m going to town, I have to
collect my typed up pages. Later
I'd like to show them to you,
Professor.

PERLMAN
(imitating Oliver)
Later.

Everyone laughs, Oliver also is amused.
PERLMAN (CONT’ D)
Before you leave we'll certainly
find the time to go over these
revisions.

The thought of Oliver's departure marks a shadow on Elio's
face.

OLIVER
So.. Later!

More laughing. OLIVER leaves the table and walks away. ELIO
stands and follows, as his parents look at him.

EXT. MAIN ENTRANCE - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 112

ELIO pulls his bike out and at the gate, a bit gingerly, sits
on it. It hurts, but he goes after Oliver.
113

74,

EXT. PIAZZA DUOMO - CREMA - DAY 113

The central square with Crema's Duomo. ELIO sees OLIVER at
the newstand, sitting on his bike and scanning the headlines
of the International Herald Tribune, before heading in the
direction of the post office. ELIO rushes up to him.

OLIVER
Something wrong?

ELIO
I just had to see you.

OLIVER
Aren’t you sick of me?

ELIO
I just wanted to be with you.
If you want, I’11 go back now.

OLIVER stands still, dropping his hand with the bundle of
unsent letters, and simply stands there staring at ELIO,
shaking his head.

OLIVER
Do you have any idea how glad I am
we slept together?

ELIO
I don’t know.

OLIVER
It’s just like you not to know. I
don’t want you to regret any of it.
I just dread the thought of having
messed you up. I don’t want either
of us to have to pay one way or
another.

ELIO
I’m not telling anyone. There won’t
be any trouble.

OLIVER
I didn’t mean that. I’m sure I’11l
pay for it somehow, though. For
you, however you think of it, it’s
still fun and games, which it
should be. For me it’s something
else which I haven’t figured out,
and the fact that I can’t scares
me.

ELIO
Are you sorry I came here?

OLIVER
I’d kiss you if I could.

ELIO
(coming up close to
Oliver)
Fuck me, Elio.

OLIVER repeats his own name three times in Elio’s ear.

LIFE IN THE GARDEN
A second unit series of shots of life in the garden.
INT. KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - EARLY AFTERNOON 114

MAFALDA is washing dishes in the kitchen. She clears away the
dessert plates from lunch with their fruit peelings. ANCHISE
enters the room with a basket full of huge, glowing,
succulent-looking peaches.

MAFALDA
(in Italian)
Put them over there.

MAFALDA points to the fruit bowl at the center of the table.

ELIO enters the kitchen from the outside, with a book in his
hands and a towel on his shoulders. His eyes fall on the
freshly picked fruit. He picks out two and leaves the room.

INT. STAIRCASE - PERLMAN VILLA - EARLY AFTERNOON 115

On the stairs he meets ANNELLA on her way up to nap and
kisses her. She looks pleased by this unexpected show of
affection from her teenage son. He eats a peach.

INT. ATTIC - PERLMAN VILLA - EARLY AFTERNOON 116

ELIO enters the attic. Puts the remaining peach on the old
bedside table and lies down on the mattress where he made
love with Marzia. He opens his book and starts reading but,
easily distracted, starts looking outside the window at the
glorious summer sky.

He tries reading again, but still no chance. His gaze scans
the room, the abandoned objects, the dark corners... the
peaches.

He stretches out his hand to one and plays with it. He turns
its crease towards him. Then opens it half-way with his
thumbs and pushes the pit out. The pit falls on the attic
floor. He brings the fuzzy, blush-colored peach to his groin
and lowers his swim trunks. He presses himself into it until
the parted fruit slides down his erection. The fruit is
leaking on him. Though firm, it breaks apart.
76.

Holding the two halves of the reddened core in either hand,
he begins to rub himself with them.

When his orgasm comes, very soon, he carefully aims the
spurts into the open peach. “What a crazy thing this was!” he
thinks, as he holds the fruit in both hands and looks around.
He places the two halves of the raped peach on the bedside
table and covers himself with the towel.

Later. Elio wakes to the sound of someone entering the attic.

OLIVER
I was looking everywhere for you...
What are you doing up here?

OLIVER sits next to him on the mattress. He starts kissing
him on one arm. He removes the towel to reveal, to his
surprise, that Elio is not wearing his swimsuit. He then
swiftly leans down bringing his lips to Elio's groin, but
after a moment he looks up with a questioning expression.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
What have you done?

OLIVER looks at the broken peach beside them. He picks it up.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
(holding it out)
Is this what I think it is?

ELIO nods in mock shame.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
You tried out the plant kingdom?
Next will be minerals? You’re
rejecting the animal kingdom
already? That would be me, I
suppose.

ELIO
I’m sick, aren’t I?

Oliver pulls off his bathing suit.
OLIVER
I wish everyone were as sick as

you. Want to see sick?

He peers into the peach for a moment, ELIO pretends to hide
his eyes.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
Now may I taste it?

ELIO
Don’t!
77.

But OLIVER dips a finger into the core of the peach and
brings it to his mouth.

OLIVER
The peach juice helps a lot.
(offering it)
Want to try it?

ELIO
(reaching for Oliver’s
hand holding the peach)
Let it go! No!

OLIVER holds it farther away.

ELIO (CONT’D)
Look, you don’t have to do this.
I’m the one who came after you.
Everything that’s happened is
because of me -

OLIVER
(still holding the peach
away from ELIO)
Nonsense. I wanted you from day
one. I just hid it better.

ELIO lunges out again to grab the fruit from Oliver’s hand,
but with his other hand OLIVER catches hold of his wrist and
squeezes it hard.

ELIO
You're hurting me.

OLIVER
Then let go.

ELIO reaches out to him, bursting into tears. He muffles his
sobs against Oliver’s bare shoulder. Then OLIVER holds him
close.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
(as if soothing a child)
Whatever happens between us, Elio,
I just want you to know..

ELIO
(sobbing)
What?

OLIVER
(taking hold of Elio’s
hand)
Don’t ever say you didn’t know.

They kiss as lovers committing themselves.

INT./EXT. HUT - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 117

The same night. The Perlman house is mostly dark, the window
shutters all closed. There is a little light out in the hut
next to the garage, where Anchise sleeps. We see him through
the window, sitting at a table working on something. He has
taken some tool apart and is cleaning the pieces, filing an
edge of metal and so forth.

INT./EXT. PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 118

Through another lit window, in Mafalda’s part of the house,
we can see MAFALDA ironing. She is carefully pressing the
sleeve of Oliver’s blue shirt.

EXT. GARDEN - PERLMAN VILLA -NIGHT 119

The garden of the villa in the darkness, alluring and
enigmatic.

ELIO
What are you thinking about?

OLIVER
Things. Going back to the States.
The courses I have to teach this
fall. My book. You.

ELIO
No one else?

OLIVER
No one else.

Silence.

ELIO
In two weeks you’11 be back at
Columbia. I don’t know what I’11 do
then. At least you’1l be somewhere
else, where there aren’t any
memories... We wasted so many days —
so many weeks.

OLIVER
Wasted? I don’t know.

ELIO
...why didn’t you give me a sign?

OLIVER
I did. At least I tried.

ELIO
When?
120

121

122

Revision79.

OLIVER
Once, when we were playing
volleyball, I touched you... Just
as a way of showing... I liked you.
The way you reacted made me feel
I’d almost molested you. I decided
to keep my distance.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 120

From the open window of their bedroom the Perlmans can hear
Elio and Oliver talking. Not the words. But the tone of the
conversation is undeniably intimate.

ANNELLA is on a small sofa. PERLMAN is already in bed, they
look at each other for a long moment. The off-screen voices
are almost whispers, they continue. PERLMAN stands, moves a
sofa chair to be closer to his wife, then sits on it. He
takes her hand and kisses it.

PERLMAN
Elio e Oliver si sono proprio
trovati. (Elio and Oliver have
grown quite fond of each other)

ANNELLA
Si, hanno una bella amicizia. (Yes.
They have a beautiful friendship)

. PERLMAN
E un peccato che parta.. (It’s a
shame he’s leaving)

(beat)
Sta tornando il fresco. (The nights
are getting cool again)

ANNELLA smiles at her husband. Aroused, he reaches over for
Annella to pull her toward him.

INT. ELIO’S BEDROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 121

Next day. Oliver’s blue shirt is on a hanger, all clean and
pressed by Mafalda, with an attached note: “For Oliver, from
Elio.” Elio strips off the shirt he’s wearing and puts on the
fresh one from Oliver. He looks at himself approvingly in the
mirror after buttoning it up, then says to his image: “I do
know you, and you’re not so bad.” He unbuttons the top couple
of buttons in order to acquire Oliver’s more laid-back look.

EXT. GARDEN IN FRONT OF THE KITCHEN - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 122
ELIO wears the shirt down to breakfast. No one comments on

it, including OLIVER, who puts his bare foot under Elio’s
when he takes a seat.
123

124

80.

MAFALDA puts an egg down in front of OLIVER, but before she
can prepare it for him ELIO takes it and expertly cracks the
top for him with his spoon.

PERLMAN observes his son’s protective concern that no speck
of the shell should fall into Oliver’s egg.

ELIO
Americans never know how to do it.

PERLMAN
I’m sure we have our way.

Oliver’s foot under the table resting on Elio’s signals that
maybe he should let it go and he seizes the second egg,
cracking it himself.

INT. STAIRCASE - PERLMAN VILLA - DAY 123

Later. ELIO runs down the stairs wearing a bathing suit and
OLIVER’s blue shirt, carrying a towel.

The front door opens and MARZIA walks in. She looks at him
questioningly. ELIO would like her not to be there.

MARZIA
(in French)
Tu as disparu pendant trois jours.
(You've been gone three days.)

ELIO
I.. had to work.

MARZIA

(in French)
Mais tu as disparu...
(But you disappeared.)

Elio doesn’t know what to say, or do.
MARZIA (CONT’D)
Am I your girl?
(Est-ce que je suis ta copine?

Elio doesn't reply. MARZIA leaves, trying to keep from
crying.

EXT. ABBEVERATOIO - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 124
By the pool. PERLMAN and ANNELLA sit at a table in their
bathing suits having a drink. ELIO and OLIVER sit on the edge
of the pool at the other end, their feet in the water.

ELIO
I hurt her feelings. Love hurts.
125

Revision81.

OLIVER, thinking they are unobserved by the others, caresses
Elio’s foot next to his in the water with one of his own.

Perlman sees this from where he is sitting with ANNELLA, and
nods to her in the boys’ direction. She looks over towards
OLIVER and ELIO.

PERLMAN
Oliver told me he has to go to
Bergamo for a couple of days to do
some research at the university
there before he leaves. He would
then fly home directly from Linate

ANNELLA
Oh... maybe Elio could go with him?
It would be nice for them to get
away for a couple of days. (beat
Where would they stay?

PERLMAN
He said something about a pensione.

ANNELLA
(laughing and pretendinf
to be horrified)
Oh, no! Let’s make them a hotel
reservation. A pensione, oy!

Perlman laughs with his wife.
EXT. WAR MEMORIAL - PANDINO - DUSK 125

OLIVER and ELIO, still wearing their swimsuits, are in front
of the War World I Memorial for Fallen Soldiers, in the
nearby town of Pandino. Elio crosses the steps and tries to
put his arms around it; he stands there spread-eagled.

ELIO
They’re too big for even two men to
get their arms around.

OLIVER
Let’s see.

OLIVER goes up and his arms flung out. Then attacks the
problem from the other side of the monument, facing it, and
putting his arms around it in a kind of embrace.

Unseen by them, a young couple - a boy anda girl - are
embracing in the underbrush nearby. They smile at the two
young men and renew their own hugging. They look like a
shepherd and shepherdess, wearing simple, everyday work
clothes.

Unseen, they watch ELIO and OLIVER, whose extended fingertips
almost touch, but not quite.

Revision82.

They are still several inches apart as they stretch their
bodies, exhaling with their effort. But the stone gleams
stubbornly in the space between their fingers.

OLIVER decides to cheat, and moves in ELIO’s direction, until
they make contact. They yell and OLIVER gathers ELIO into his
arms and kisses him.

The boy and girl in the shadows resume their own kiss.

OLIVER puts a hand inside ELIO’s bathing suit, but ELIO
pushes him away.

ELIO
Not here. Not in all this, not on
this stone.

The two young men run back to their bikes and ride off
watched by the young couple. The “Shepherd” moves his hand
on the breast of the “Shepherdess,” and she lets him keep it
there.

EXT. COACH STATION - MONTODINE - DAY 126

OLIVER puts his suitcases in the open trunk of a waiting
coach. He is saying his goodbyes to the PERLMANS before he
and ELIO get on it. ANNELLA kisses Oliver with great
affection; PERLMAN shakes his hand warmly, all formality
gone. Both say “Come back soon!" The driver closes the trunk.

ELIO says goodbye to his parents, unable to hide an honest
smile of happiness.

Chiara arrives driving her bike to salute Oliver but the
coach is leaving...

The Perlmans and Chiara watch the coach drive away as Elio
and Oliver take seats inside it.

INT./EXT. BUS - FROM CREMA TO ALPI OROBIE - DAY 127
Oliver smiles and waves to Chiara on the half-crowded bus.
OLIVER dozes off, his head on ELIO’s shoulder. ELIO looks at
him, his gaze full of unaccountable emotions.

Outside the window the summer landscape changes from the flat
plains into the first alps, the Orobie.

EXT. BOSCO/PRATO - CASCATE DEL SERIO - DAY 128

A small forest of beech and fir trees. ELIO and OLIVER walk
on a trail with their backpacks.

129

83.

They cross a small bridge over a creek and reach a large
grass field, looking towards the mountain patiently awaiting
something.

Oliver looks at ELIO and hugs him, a friendly grab-hug. Then
a hand moves down on Elio's thigh, and he looks around.

The explosion of water in the mountain is violent and
unexpected. The river leaps three times on the rocks before
it reaches the bottom of the valley. OLIVER jumps up and in a
very American impulse howls at this spectacle of water. ELIO
laughs. They run to the water and disappear into the cascade.

INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - BERGAMO - AFTERNOON 129

ELIO and OLIVER enter their hotel bedroom in Bergamo. They
look around and laugh, for no apparent reason.

Later. There is a large window looking out over the front
entrance of the hotel and a parking lot adjoining it.

OLIVER stands looking out as ELIO comes up from behind him,
putting his arms around Oliver’s waist. Both are wearing
boxer shorts.

EXT. STREETS - BERGAMO - NIGHT 130

Elio and Oliver are drunk. They stroll in the streets of the
old town, stumbling, laughing. Taking advantage of a deserted
alley OLIVER pushes ELIO against the wall and kisses him.
Then suddenly stops.

ELIO
What?

OLIVER
Listen!

ELIO

Listen to what?

Among the soft sounds of the sleeping city is a distant
melody.
OLIVER
This song!

ELIO
There’s no song. You’re
hallucinating.

Elio tries to kiss him again but Oliver grabs his hand and
pulls him away.
OLIVER
Let’s go!
131

84.
EXT. PIAZZETTA - BERGAMO - NIGHT 131

In a small square in the old part of town three young men and
a girl are leaning on a wall. They are wearing oversized
jackets and make-up; they are early examples of the "New
Romantic" fashion.

At their feet is a radio playing “Love My Way”, the song that
was also playing at the open-air dancing bar a few weeks
earlier. OLIVER looks at ELIO as if to say "See?", then
salutes the youngsters, only to be ignored.

OLIVER
Psychedelic Furs. The best!

The New Romantics seem uninterested. OLIVER starts dancing,
as we already saw him do, alone. He then grabs the girl,
intending for her to dance with him, and it seems like the
situation could go badly.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
(in lousy Italan)
Li ho visti a New York l’anno
scorso. Richard Butler...

spettacolo!
(I saw them in New York last year.
Richard Butler... awesome!)

RAGAZZA NEW ROMANTIC
(romagnolo accent)
Davvero? Li abbiam visti anche noi
in concerto! Siamo andati a Londra
facendo 1’autostop...
(Really? We saw them in concert
too! We hitch-hiked to London...)

OLIVER
Best way to travel around!

So the other New Romantics join the dance, with their
syncopated moves. ELIO doesn't dance, he looks, uncertain. At
the song's climax he bursts out puking suddenly and
abundantly.

EXT. STRADA CON FONTANA - BERGAMO - DAWN 132

OLIVER holds ELIO's forehead as he pukes. Elio stands away
from the wall making an "I'm okay now" gesture, and goes to
the fountain nearby to splash water on his face.

ELIO
It's the best day of my life and I
end it with puking!

Oliver looks around to check that nobody is looking and
starts kissing him again. Elio lets himself go.
133

134

85.

With his eyes still closed he hears male voices passing
nearby muttering something against them, but he doesn't care.

IT’S THE KISS OF A LIFETIME.
INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - DAWN 133

OLIVER and ELIO are hugging on their hotel bed. OLIVER looks
at ELIO sleeping. A HISSING sound in the distance.

EXT. BINARIO - STAZIONE DI CLUSONE - DAY 134

It is the sound of a train arriving at the station, on the
main platform.

ELIO and OLIVER together look at the train come to a stop.
ELIO is wearing Oliver’s blue shirt. On the platform are a
few travellers ready to leave. Oliver's bags are those for
his trip back home; they are about to say goodbye.

The train doors open, some people come out, others get in
while saying their goodbyes to their counterparts.

Elio and Oliver aren't moving, they try to delay the
inevitable, if only for a few seconds. The voice on the
intercom informs that the Express train for Rome is about to
depart from Platform 1.

ELIO
Did you get your passport?

OLIVER
Yeah, I did.

The travellers are all on the train, except for Oliver..

The conductor is a few cars down, looking at his watch. A
moment of suspended, cruel silence.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
There's emptiness behind your eyes/
there's dust in our hearts/ Love my
way, it's a new road...

Elio listens to these words, which Oliver starts to sing
sweetly, whispering.

OLIVER (CONT’D)
I follow where my mind goes, so
swallow all your tears, my love/
And put on your new face/ You can
never win or lose, if you don't run
the race.

They hug. OLIVER grabs his bags and enters the train.
135

136

137

86.

The train leaves. Elio watches it disappear in the distance.
Wiped out, he walks along the platform and sits on a bench,
his gaze lost in thoughts. After a long beat he stands and go
to the...

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - STAZIONE DI CLUSONE - DAY 135

ELIO dials a number on a public phone, he does so
mechanically. A few moments later somebody picks up.

ELIO
Mafalda? Maman... Bonjour. Oui, je
vais bien. Je suis a Clusone, 4 la
gare. Oui... il est parti. Maman,
s'il te plait, tu pourrais venir me
chercher?
(Mafalda? Mom... Hey. Yes, I'm

fine. I'm in Clusone, at the
station. Yes.. he left. Mom..
please could you come pick me up?)

INT./EXT. CAR/COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON 136

ANNELLA is with ELIO in the car. She is driving back to the
villa. ELIO is silent. Oliver’s blue shirt is open over
Elio's bare chest and blows in the wind.

She looks at him. She reaches out with her free hand and
caresses his cheek, the sweetest gesture.

Elio’s face crumples. He starts to cry. She wipes his tears
away with her free hand but he cannot stop.

EXT STREETS OF TOWN - AFTERNOON 137
The Perlman car is parked in town. ELIO is alone, sitting on
the passenger seat. The car's radio is playing some summer
song.

In the distance, a group of Elio's friends are walking about.
Among them is MARZIA, who notices the Perlman car, then Elio.
She waves at her friends and leaves them to come towards him.

MARZIA
Ciao.

Elio notices her only when she is close.

MARZIA (CONT’D)
How are you?

ELIO
Good, thanks.
138

87.

Elio tries straightening up to hide his emotions, his face
recently upset by tears.

MARZIA

(in French)
J'ai lu le livre que
tu m'as offert, les poémes.
Ils sont trés beaux. J’aime
beaucoup cette Antonia Pozzi.
(I read the book you gave me, the
poems, they are beautiful. I really
love Antonia Pozzi.)
“Nell’aria della stanza - non te
guardo - ma gia il ricordo del tuo
viso” (In the room’s air - not you
do I look at - but already the
memory of your face)

Elio nods, smiling back at her.

MARZIA (CONT’D)
I'm sorry you feel so bad. I just
wanted to tell you that I'm not mad
at you. I love you. (Je suis
désolée que tu sois si malheureux.
Je voulais juste te dire que je ne
t'en veux pas. Je t'aime.)

Elio is surprised and comforted by Marzia's words. She
extends her hand to him.

MARZIA (CONT’D)
On reste amis?
(Friends.)

Elio shakes her hand, then exits the car and hugs her,
sighing. Annella is approaching.

ELIO
Pour la vie?
(Forever?)

MARZIA
Pour la vie.
(Forever)

EXT. PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 138

The car comes through the gate. ANCHISE comes forward and
offers to carry the backpack up to his room, ELIO tells him
that backpacks should be carried by their owners.

ANCHISE
Il signor Ulliva 6 partito? (Has
mister Ulliva left?)
139

140

141

88.

ELIO

Si, stamattina. (Yes, this morning)
ANCHISE

Anche a me duole. (I too am

saddened) .

ELIO avoids his eyes, not wanting to encourage him to say
anything further, and goes inside.

INT. STAIRCASE - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 139
ELIO meets MAFALDA coming down the stairs.

MAFALDA
I fixed up your room the way it
was.

ELIO frowns, angered by this news.

INT. OLIVER’S ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 140

Elio’s room, in which Oliver has stayed. Alone now, ELIO
enters it and looks around. Everything of his has been put
back, his clothes in the closet and drawers. He drops his
backpack on the floor and throws himself down on the sunlit
bed. The bedspread is the same. He closes his eyes. He is
glad to be back in his old room, now full of sustaining
memories of Oliver.

INT. PERLMAN STUDIO - PERLMAN VILLA - EVENING/NIGHT 141

Professor PERLMAN is sitting in his usual place, but his
chair is turned out to face the garden. On his lap are proofs
of his latest book. He is drinking. Three large citronella
candles next to him keep the mosquitoes away.

ELIO comes into the room to say good night. His father puts
away his manuscript with a toss and lights a cigarette - his
last of the day - using one of the citronella candles.

PERLMAN
So? Welcome home. Did Oliver enjoy
the trip?

ELIO
I think he did.

PERLMAN takes a drag from his cigarette, then pauses a moment
before speaking.

PERLMAN
You two had a nice friendship.
89.

ELIO
(somewhat evasive)
Yes.

Another pause, and another drag on his cigarette.

PERLMAN
You’ re too smart not to know how
rare, how special, what you two had
was.

ELIO
Oliver was Oliver.

PERLMAN
“Parce-que c’etait lui, parce-que
c’etait moi.”

ELIO
(trying to avoid talking
about Oliver with his
father)
Oliver may be very intelligent -

PERLMAN

(interrupting his son)
Intelligent? He was more than
intelligent. What you two had had
everything and nothing to do with
intelligence. He was good, and you
were both lucky to have found each
other, because you too are good.

ELIO
I think he was better than me.

PERLMAN
I’m sure he’d say the same thing
about you, which flatters the two
of you.

In tapping his cigarette and leaning toward the ashtray, he
reaches out and touches Elio’s hand. PERLMAN alters his tone
of voice (his tone says: We don’t have to speak about it, but
let’s not pretend we don’t know what I’m saying).

PERLMAN (CONT’D)
When you least expect it, Nature
has cunning ways of finding our
weakest spot. Just remember: I am
here. Right now you may not want to
feel anything. Perhaps you never
wished to feel anything. And
perhaps it’s not to me that you’ll
want to speak about these things.
But feel something you obviously
did.
90.

ELIO looks at his father, then drops his eyes to the floor.

PERLMAN (CONT’D) Look -
you had a beautiful friendship.
Maybe more than a friendship. And I
envy you. In my place, most parents
would hope the whole thing goes
away, to pray that their sons land
on their feet. But
I am not such a parent. In your
place, if there is pain, nurse it.
And if there is a flame, don’t
snuff it out. Don’t be brutal with
it. We rip out so much of ourselves
to be cured of things faster, that
we go bankrupt by the age of thirty
and have less to offer each time we
start with someone new. But to make
yourself feel nothing so as not to
feel anything - what a waste!

ELIO is dumbstruck as he tries to take all this in.

PERLMAN (CONT’D)
Have I spoken out of turn?

ELIO shakes his head.

PERLMAN (CONT’D)
Then let me say one more thing. It
will clear the air. I may have come
close, but I never had what you two
had. Something always held me back
or stood in the way. How you live
your life is your business.
Remember, our hearts and our bodies
are given to us only once. And
before you know it, your heart is
worn out, and, as for your body,
there comes a point when no one
looks at it, much less wants to
come near it. Right now there’s
sorrow. Pain. Don’t kill it and
with it the joy you’ve felt.

PERLMAN takes a breath.

PERLMAN (CONT’D)
We may never speak about this
again. But I hope you’ll never hold
it against me that we did. I will
have been a terrible father if, one
day, you’d want to speak to me and
felt that the door was shut, or not
sufficiently open.

ELIO
Does mother know?
142

143

Revision91.

PERLMAN
I don’t think she does.
(but his voice means “Even
if she did, I am sure her
attitude would be no
different than mine”

EXT. CAMPAGNA - PERLMAN VILLA - WINTER DAY 142

The Perlman villa in Winter. A foggy day. Six months later,
ELIO walks in the countryside that surrounds the villa.

NARRATORE
They had become each other that
summer. And long after every
forked road in life had done its
work this would always be true.
Their lives scarcely touched in
those weeks together, but they had
crossed to the other side, where
time stops and heaven reaches down
to earth and gives us that ration
of what is from birth divinely
ours. They could look the other way
and speak of everything but, they
would always know. They had found
the stars, Elio and Oliver. And
this is given once only.

He crosses the gate and comes back in the garden. He enters
the house.

INT. KITCHEN/STAIRCASE/BOCCHIRALE - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNGON

ELIO walks through the kitchen and up the stairs. The
telephone rings and ELIO runs down the stairs to answer it,
an expression of excited expectancy on his face. It is
OLIVER, calling from New York.

OLIVER (V.O.)
Elio? Are you there?

ELIO
I’m here, I’m here. How are you?

OLIVER (V.O.)
Fine. How are your parents?

ELIO
Fine, too... I miss you.

OLIVER (V.O.)
I miss you too. Very much. (long
beat) I have some news.

*
92.

ELIO
What news? You’re getting married,
I suppose.
(laughing)

OLIVER (V.O.)
I might be getting married this
spring.

ELIO
(dumb founded)
You never said anything.

OLIVER (V.O.)
It’s been off and on for two years.

ELIO
But that’s wonderful news!

OLIVER (V.O.)
Do you mind?

ELIO
You're being silly.

There is a long silence. ELIO’s genuine congratulatory smile
fades.

Just then ANNELLA appears, and ELIO hands it to his mother.

ANNELLA
Why aren’t you here? When are you
coming? Elio misses you terribly,
going around all the time with such
a long face!

She and PERLMAN exchange greetings with OLIVER.

PERLMAN
You caught us while in the process
of choosing the new you for next
summer..

“Wonderful, wonderful!” they say. When they go out, PERLMAN
hands the receiver back to ELIO, who reaches for it before
they can hang up.

ELIO
(lowering his voice when
he is sure they’ve left
the room)
They know about us...
OLIVER (V.O.)
I figured.

ELIO
How?

93.

OLIVER (V.O.)
From the way your father spoke - he
made me feel like a member of the
family - almost like a son-in-law.
You’ re lucky. My father would have
carted me off to a correctional
facility.

ELIO
(daringly)
“Elio, Elio”

OLIVER (V.O.)
(After a very long beat)
Oliver.. I remember everything

INT.PROFESSOR PERLMAN’S STUDY - PERLMAN VILLA - AFTERNOON 144

The PERLMANS and MAFALDA are at a big table spread out with
what look like application letters, with photos attached.
It’s the ritual that takes place every year, they evaluate
several letters of proposal sent by advanced graduate
students in America, or young aspiring scholars from there.
It's the ritual that brought about the choice of Oliver last
year.

ELIO enters the room, he looks over the photos, the resumés.
There are half a dozen young men and a couple of young women.

ANNELLA
E questo?
(This one?)

But Elio is not interested in this. They watch him leave the
study.

INT. DINING ROOM - PERLMAN VILLA - NIGHT 145
Elio enters the dining room all dressed for the celebration
lunch. Light is dimming outside the windows. Activities
around the table between Annella and Mafalda (placing
flowers, lighting candles etc)

Elio crouches in front of the fire.

His face lost in thoughts.

The entire end credit scrolls on his close up.

Near the end
ANNELLA
Elio, Elio
94.

Elio is so deeply in his thoughts that only after a long beat
after Annella calling him he turns toward the sound of her
voice.

Fade to black.
