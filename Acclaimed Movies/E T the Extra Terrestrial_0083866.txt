The BLACK SCREEN becomes a NIGHT SKY as one by one, stars 1
begin to- poke through and come to life in the darkness.

BEGIN TITLES

PAN across the SXY, creating the illusion of moving deeper
into SPACE. This illusion is shattered with the intrusion
of a familiar CRESCENT MOON.

The MOON drops behind a gnarled TREES LIMB and the LIMS pulls
away to reveal the pointed tree tops of a REDWOOD FOREST.

A SOFT LIGHT is visible through the heavy camouflage of TREES.
The VIEW MOVES toward this LIGET, up and over the TREES and
finally comes te rest on a freak clearing, a barren meadow,
nestled among the towering trees.

Tt is here that we see the SPACESHIP.

The SHIP gently fleats, anchored to the earth by a beam of
davender light.

EXT. THE LANDING SITE - NICE? 2

The SPACESHIP is not large. It slightly resembles a reflec-
tive, hot-air balloon, a Christmas tree ornament, inscribed
with a delicate cothis des An oben hatch door stretches
down to the grassy landing site. Soft pastel light spills
from the interior of tne SHIP, and in this light, we make out
the movements of CREATURES.

  

The CREATURES are short, stocky, numanoid, but our distance
and the misty atmoschers prevant any close identification

of feacures. The CREATURES are banded together, working
with strange, antiquated tools, probing the Earth. Their
jerky movements and their reaction to the slightest sound -
an owl hooting, a bird flying, the rustle of leaves - raveal
their hesitancy and fear.

 
 

A smoky, white, camouflaging mist seems to emanate from che
CREATURES themselves, on an inhale-exhale chythm, as if their
hot breath was consolidating in the cool night air, Blanketing
their tracks with fog.

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:-

An OWL HOOTS. THE CREATURES PREECE. The danger passes.
Work is resumed.

INSERT: HANDS

A STRANGE PAIR OF HANDS - four fingered, long and slender
delicate. The hands dig into the soil and pull a flowering
herb from the ground.

LONG SHOT: A CREATURE

ONE CREATURE walks toward the open hatch door, carrying
the same flowering weed. FOLLOW him up the gangplank
and into the SHIP. .

INT. SPACE SHIP - NIGHT

A soft-white cen of mist. We HEAR clearly now the unicue
breathing pattern of THE CREATURE as we see his obscured form
move through the ship.

INT. SHIP'S GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

The mist clears and we are in a greenhouse -@
cathedral of a structure. Heavy precipitation
from the decorative fanning roofline. THE CREATURE

places the HERB in a basin filled with a thick liquid.

 

INSERT: THE HERB

It takes root in this liquid and straightens with life.
It is then spotlit by a shaft of pastel lignt.

PULL BACK: THE BASIN

The basin is filled with plants - plants which reflect
the tropics of Earth: orchids, cactus, a baobab tree.
All plants are being systematically nurtured by
orchestrated shafts of pastel lights.

EXT. LANDING SITE - NIGHT

THE CREATURE cescends the cancplank and walks past the

group of his FELLOW CREATURES. HE comes to the edge of .
this slightly-raised field and looks out toward the trees.
THE CREATURE carefully cescends the rocky incline surrounding
the field and disappears inte the tall grass which marks

the entrance to the forest.

 

REVERSE: A FELLOW CREATURE

One FELLOW CREATURE stops his work. A RED LIGHT begins
to glow in his chest - as if a deeply-buried heart were
shining and the red glow was seeping through thin,
translucent skin.

EXT. TALL GRASS = NIGHT

THE CREATURE reappears from out of the TALL GRASS. He
faces the shin. HIS HEART also begins to shine through,
and the ruby glow pinpoints him: a small awkward creature,
aione in the gigantic Redwood Forest under a starry sky.

REVERSE: A FELLOW CREATURE

The FELLOW CREATURE resumes his work.

EIGH ANGLE: THE CREATURE

THE CREATURE, still lit by his own conscience, turns and
docks up at a towering fir tree. The RED LIGHT goes out.
HE walks into the forest.

EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

THE SOUNDS of the forest rise: birds, babbling brooks,
the twitter of insects. THE CREATURE moves deeper

inte the forest.

AT HIS TEET: A TABLEAU ° .

A perfect tableau -- wildflewers, ferns and moss.

* HE CREATURE sinks to his haunches and reaches out to take

one thing - a sapling - a miniature REDWOOD, a perfect
bonzai, growing at the feet of its elders. As THE CREATURE
RISES, he is momentarily silhouetted in a glimmer of light,
coming from the far sice of the forest.

THE CREATURE turns and looks in the direction of his ship.
Then, he looks back in the. direction of the strange light.
THE CREATURE begins to walk towareé the unidentified light.

More cars converge on the scene. We SEE bricht HEADLIGHTS

the only mother who w2ll allow all-night DéeD games.
Her wet hair is wrapped in a cowel, and she is wearing
a silk kimono.

“MARY
Do you see what this room looks
like right now?
ELLIOTT looks. It is obviously brand new clean - a place
for everything and evervthing in its Place. The "things"
are the cultural artifacts of Pre-pubescent boys: toys,
stolen street signs, record Player, guppies.

One distinguishing feature in this room is a skylight -
covered with 4 handpainted sheet - featuring a dragon
and his fiery breath.

ELLIOTT

There is no response. ELLIOTT lays the pizza on the

He notices the footprints. He follows them. The prints
come to an abrupt end. ELLIOTT parts two tall stalks of
corn and shines the flashlight between them.

E.T.'s face comes bursting threugh the corn stalks.

It is a terrible sight, like nothing we have ever seen
before. E.T.'s wide head is tightened back in leathery
creases and furrows. His thin lips are parted in a horrible
grimace, His large round eyes are wide, the pupils

dilated to an enormous size. Tiny, sharp teeth are

barec as E.T. makes a terrifying sound--an imitative
noise--the SOUND of KEYS.

The flashlight hits the ground. ELLIOTT hits the ground.
In the light we can see ELLIOTT's small fingers dig into
the soil. E.T.'s ugly head screams again. ELLIOTT hugs

“the ground. He makes a soft, scared sound.

EXT/INT. ELLIOTT’S ROOM = NIGHT 127
VIEW OF A NIGHT SKY FILLED WITH STARS.
The VIEW PULLS IN to ELLIOTT's room. ELLIOTT is sitting on

his top bunk, silhouetted acainst his windew, wrapped ina
blanket. His focus is unchanging, directed at the closes.

 

His door opens, and MICHAEL, clad in Pajamas, comes in and
Climbs up next to him. Together they stare in the directicn
ef the closet. The HERA HOVES across the filthy room and
teward the closet. The door is open, and a dim light

can be seen. .

INT. THE CLOSET ~ NIGHT ‘ 30% 5909 128

The CAMERA moves into the closet, past the barricades of
storage boxes and stuffed animals. E.T. sits in his living
area, locking through one of Gertie's ABC books. He turns
the pages slowly, stopping at the letter 'B', for BOY.

E.T. touches the drawing of the small boy.

E.T. looks up, and his attention is drawn to the GERANIUM,
now placed under the closet window. £.7. stares at the flower.

REVERSE: THE FLOWER . : 129

Before our eyes, the flewear turns on its stem. As it
faces E.T., it straightens. In a burst of life, its tight
buds begin to open, suddenly blooming, bursting forth in
brilliant red ilowers. :

Okay. So he hears real coed and

ELLIOTT is silent. He looks slightly paranoid as he turns
to double check every adult in the vicinity: the milkman,
a lady walking a dog, a man sitting in a car at the corner.

ELLIOTT
He's alone. Any moron can see
that. Is that our regular

he’s like a worker bee who only knows

INT. CLOSET - NIGHT . 188

E.T. is sitting in his nesting area. A man's old college
jacket is draped over his shoulders.

He is working on his COMMUNICATOR. A definize mechine

has begun to take shape. The wooden hanger now has twenty=
six colored wires protruding from the dowel stick, and these
wires are attached to the open "Speak & Spell." The
Speakers from the "walkie-talkies" are taped to the front
of the "Speak & Spell," and a heavy piece of coaxial cable
leads from these speakers to a coffee can.,

At this moment, E.T. is examining the workings of 2 child's
record player.

He is also listening to MARY tell GERTIE her bedtime story.

He also nas the shivers.

ELLIOTT looks at the spaceman, and his face registers his
concern. The dcy becins to unload the cardboard box. He
pulls out serewdrivers, naiis, the "Fuzz-Buster" and the
soldering iron.

When he pulls out a ragced-toothed sawblade, he scrapes
a mean cut in his finger.

The boy blows on his wounded hand. E.T. looks up.

MARY (0.C.)
Her light is srowing faint and
if it goes out, that means she is
dead. Her voice is so low I can
scarcely tell what she is saying.

E.T. raises his forefinger, and it slowly takes on 2
brilliant pink giow. This is new to ELLIOTT, and the boy
automatically backs away from E.T.

MARY (0.C.)
She says she thinks she couid get
well again if children believe in
fairies! Peter rises and throws
out his arms, he knows not to whom,
perhaps to the boys and girls of
whom he is not one. "Do vou

E.T. touches ELLIOTT's wound with his glowing finger.

Psycholocist. All have come to Brebe the mystery that has lived
within this home. and it élso appears, they have come to attempt
to save two lives - E.T.'s and ELLIOTT'S. MARY is sitting in a

Every conceivable spot is occupied by a machine, or a moniter

of the room flap against the floor as air pushes down from a
ceiling filter and cleanses the small environment. Doctors
encircle the room. Five of them have their arms inserted into
the room via rubber gloves. They are touching, testing and
examining the room's two eceupants, Elliott and £.T.

down the driveway, it rips the air tube away from the front door.

‘look into the front seat. MICHAEL sees them. He pulls off his

face mask.
