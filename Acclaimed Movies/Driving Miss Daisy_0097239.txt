DRIVING MISS DAISY

FADE IN:
INT. DAISY'S BEDROOM - DAY / AUGUST 1948

A precise, orderly room. Comfortable and well maintained, but
not. fancy or trendy. Venetian blinds are drawn against the
hot August sun. The room seems to be in repose. Suddenly the
face of DAISY WERTHAN appears, looking directly at us. She
straightens the straw hat on her head. We realize we have
been looking at a mirror image of the room.

Daisy is seventy-two years old and apparently in excellent
health. She wears a summer street dress, low-heeled white
shoes and appropriate summer jewelry -- no makeup.

She does not dwell on her mirror image, once the hat is
adjusted. She reaches into a bureau drawer, takes out a pair
of white gloves, gets her pocket book from the closet and
walks purposefully out of the room.

A SERIES OF SHOTS
A. Daisy in the upstairs hall.
B. Daisy walking down the carpeted steps.

c. Daisy in the downstairs hall, which contains a commode
with a 1930's telephone on it and various objets d'art.

D. Daisy in the dining room, drapes closed against the hot
sunlight.

E. Daisy through the swinging door in the pantry.

She moves briskly through the silent rooms. This is a woman
who is never idle. Everything about her suggests energy and
purpose. What we see of her house tells us that she is in
comfortable circumstances. Bookshelves are evident in many of
the rooms. The furniture is overstuffed and/or mahogany.

INT. THE KITCHEN - DAY

A spacious, black-and-white tiled kitchen -- pre-W.W.I in
dimension. The only sign of the times is a fairly modern gas
range. ‘

IDELLA, black and close to Daisy's age, stands at the sink,
under the window, polishing silver with an old toothbrush.
She does not look up, or in any way acknowledge Daisy's
entrance into the kitchen.
Daisy removes a shopping list from a cabinet drawer.

DAISY
I'm gone to the market, Idelia.

IDELLA
Mmmmmm .

Daisy heads out the door.

EXT. THE BACK YARD - DAY

Bright hot sunlight, the yard shimmering in the morning heat.
We can SEE the outside of the house now -- Georgian, built in
the teens, comfortable, but not pretentious. Green canvas
awnings protect the house from the sun.

DAISY walks to the garage, a separate building, built for two
cars, but only holding one -- a shiny new 1948 Packard. She
climbs into the car.

A SERIES OF SHOTS

A. Daisy's gloved hand turns on the ignition.

B. Her POV. Shifting the automatic gear into reverse.

Cc. Her high-heeled foot pushing the accelerator.

D. On the car, backing out of the garage and into the
turnaround.

E. On Daisy, gloved hands both clutching the wheel, back
straight, not touching the seat.

F. On the gear indicator, still in reverse.
G. On Daisy's foot, gunning the accelerator.

I. On the car, shooting backwards over an embankment,
seemingly suspended in the air for a moment before it lands on
the roof of the garage next door (down the hill) causing the
garage to collapse, which, in turn, lands on the free-standing
toolshed just adjacent to it, which also falls into pieces,
seattering garden tools, etc., in all directions. The NOISE
is deafening.

J. On Idella, looking out of the kitchen window in horror.

IDELLA
Sweet Jesus!

H. On a nursemaid and a toddler, coming out of the house next
door.
EXT. THE GARAGE - SAME TIME

Daisy's severely damaged car sits in (on) what's left of the
garage. All is still.

ON DAISY

Still in the car, still clutching the wheel with gloved hands.
Her hat is crooked and her glasses are askew, but otherwise
she is unhurt. She tests the door handle. It works. She
pushes the door open, extracts her purse from the car and gets
out.

EXT. THE NEIGHBOR'S GARAGE - DAY

What's left of Daisy's car rises in the air, ghost-like.

PULL BACK reveals that the car is being hoisted by a tow truck
and a gigantic chain and pulley operation. What's left of the
garage collapses like pick-up sticks.

BOOLIE WERTHAN, Daisy's son, age 40, stands with a policeman
and insurance agent in the yard. He wears a good summer
business suit. A sizable part of the neighborhood, black
servants, children, yard men, etc., stand silently at a
respectful distance watching the proceedings.

ON BOOLIE
He looks up the hill towards his mother's house.
BOOLIE'S POV - DAISY'S HOUSE

Daisy is watching from her bedroom window, but moves quickly
out of the way when Boolie catches her eyes.

ON THE NEIGHBOR'S YARD AGAIN

The pulley operation sets the remains of the car at rest. The
reverberations of this knock down what's left of the toolshed.

ON THE CROWD, watching silently.
INT. DAISY'S KITCHEN ~ SAME DAY

Idella is sitting on a stool, eating fried chicken and potato
salad at the kitchen counter. Boolie is seated at the kitchen
table, finishing off a plate of same. Each has a glass of ice
tea and a paper napkin, but Idella's plate is a cracked
remnant of an old pattern, her fork is from the dime store,
and her tea is in a small mason jar. Boolie is eating off of
Daisy's everyday china and silver. Daisy is not in the room,
but a THUMPING and CLUMPING 0.S. indicate that she is within
earshot. .
BOOLIE
Mama!

DAISY (0.S.)
No!

BOOLIE
Mama!

DAISY (0.S.)
No!

BOOLIE
It's a miracle you're not laying
in Emory Hospital -- or decked out
at the funeral parlor.

He rises from the table, and heads for
TRE PANTRY

Daisy is in the pantry closet, having changed out of her
street clothes into a house dress. She is kneeling on the
floor by a large pickle crock, removing the lid, the rock that
holds down a plate, which, in turn, holds down the pickles in
their brine. She maneuvers the crock out of the closet and
toward the pantry sink, waving away Boolie's efforts to help
her.

Once at the sink, she begins the operation of spearing pickles
that are already lined up by the sink and then ladling brine
into the jars and screwing on the jar tops. This operation
keeps her busy during the following scene. She spears the
first pickle out of the crock and hands it to Boolie, who
takes a bite.

DAISY
The cucumbers are pretty this
summer.

BOOLIE

Look at you! You didn't even
break your glasses.

DAISY
It was the car's fault.

BOOLIE
Mama, you had the car in the
wrong gear.
DAISY
I did not.
(calls to Idella)
Idella! You want a pickle with
your lunch?

IDELLA (0.S.)
Not me.

DAISY
Well, I'm putting up a jar for you
to take home to William, you hear?

IDELLA (0.S.)
Yassum. Thank you. He love your
pickles.

DAISY

That's because he has more sense
than you do.

BOOLIE
You had the car in reverse instead
of drive. The police report shows
that.

DAISY
You should have let me keep my
LaSalle. It never ‘would have
behaved this way.

BOOLIE
Mama, cars don't behave. They are
behaved upon. The fact is you,
all by yourself, demolished that

Packard.

DAISY
Think what you want. I know the
truth.

BOOLIE

The truth is you just cost the
insurance company twenty-seven
hundred dollars. You are a
terrible risk. Nobody is going
to issue you a policy after this.

DAISY
You're just saying that to be
hateful.
BOOLIE
Okay. Yes. Yes I am. I'm making
it all up. Every insurance company
in America is lined up out there in
the driveway, waving their fountain
pens and falling all over themselves
to get you to sign on.

DAISY
I love having you here for lunch,
son, but if you're going to stand
in my pantry and lie like a rug,
well, I think it's time for you
to go somewhere else.

BOOLIE
Okay. I'd better get back to the
office. Florine'll be having a fit
if I don't come home on time tonight.

DAISY .
That's right. I forgot. Y'all are
having dinner with the Ansleys
tonight! I'm sure Florine bought
another new dress. This is her
idea of heaven on earth, isn't it?

BOOLIE
What? .

DAISY
Socializing with Episcopalians.

BOOLIE .
You're a doodle, Mama. I'11 stop
by tomorrow evening.

DAISY
How do you know I'll be here?
I'm certainly not dependent on
you for company.

BOOLIE
Fine. I'll call first. But you
know that we have got some real
serious talking to do.

: DAISY
No.

BOOLIE
Mama}!
DAISY

(singing to end

discussion)
After the ball is over
After the break of morn
After the dancers leaving
After the stars are gone
Many a heart is aching
If you could read them all --

As soon as she starts singing, Daisy, having finished her
pickle business, turns on her heels and walks out of the
pantry. We HEAR her SINGING continue and FADE as she climbs
the stairs and eventually shuts the door to her room.

Boolie, having lost this round, picks up the largest mason jar
of pickles to take home.

ON HIS FACE: How do I handle this?
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Daisy, wearing a light summer dressing gown, raises the
blinds. Sunlight floods the room and she looks out of the
window.

EXT. GARAGE - SAME TIME - DAISY'S POV

The garage stands empty, except for an old hand lawn mower and
a few gardening tools at one side.

INT. THE BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Daisy looks grim.

INT. THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - LATER THAT DAY
Daisy, now dressed, is on the phone.

DAISY

(on the phone)
Well, I need you now! I have to be
at the beauty shop in half an hour!
-.. No, I most certainly did not
know you had to call a minimum of
two hours ahead. I don't know why
you call yourself a taxicab company
if you can't provide taxicabs!

ON IDELLA, standing in the dining room doorway with a dusting
rag in her hand, listening.
IDELLA
You call yo' son down at the plant,
he sen’ somebody to carry you.

DAISY
That won't be necessary. I'll
cancel the appointment and fix
my own hair.

IDELLA
Sometimes I think you ain't got
the sense God gave a lemon!

Daisy glares at her, but Idella, with inalienable right on her
side, returns the glare with a calm nod of her head and goes
off about her business.

EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
INT. THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - SAME TIME

Boolie enters from the kitchen. He is wearing brand new
pressed jeans with the cuffs rolled up and a plaid short-
Sleeved shirt and a bandanna around his neck. It looks wrong
on him.

FLORINE, his wife, enters behind him. She is in her middle
thirties, dark-haired, slim, very fashionable, carefully made
up. ‘Right now she is wearing a full denim skirt down to her
ankles (I think they called them circle skirts) and a plaid
blouse exactly matching Boolie's shirt. She is also wearing
gold jewelry that doesn't quite go with this outfit.

BOOLIE
(calling upstairs)
Mama? You there?

FLORINE
(also calling up)
Hey, Mother Werthan! It's just us!

ON DAISY, appearing at the landing, a book in her hand.

DAISY
Why didn't you call?

FLORINE
We can't stay.

DAISY
(sizing up the outfits)
So I gather.
BOOLIE
The Millers are giving a hayride
for their anniversary.

FLORINE
I had these made. Doesn’t your
baby look cute?

DAISY
That's not exactly the word I'd
pick.

Boolie takes the book out of her hand.

BOOLIE
I've been wanting to read this.

He looks through it.

: BOOLIE (CONT'D)
It's due back tomorrow. Want me
to take it for you?

DAISY
No thank you. I will go to the
library on the streetcar.

Boolie, getting angry, starts to say something, but Florine
puts a hand on his arm to calm him.

DAISY
Go on now. You don't want to
_ keep the horses waiting.
ON BOOLIE, exasperated.
EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

Daisy, dressed in hat and gloves, and carrying the library
book, walks down the driveway towards the street.

EXT. BUS STOP - MID-MORNING

Daisy, a young black maid, and a couple of others are waiting
at the bus stop. A City of Atlanta bus pulls up to the stop.
A couple of passengers emerge from the rear door. The waiting
passengers enter the bus, Daisy first, in deference to her
age, sex, and color.

INT. CITY BUS - SAME TIME

Daisy puts in correct fare, squeezes into a seat between a fat
country woman and a high school girl.
10.

The black maid, the last one aboard, goes to the back of the
bus, where there are black people standing and no seats. The
front of the bus has seats available.

EXT. CITY STREET - SAME TIME

The bus rattles off down the avenue.

EXT. CARNEGIE LIBRARY BRANCH - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT

A one-story brick building on a residential shopping street.
Sign in front reads "Atlanta Public Library, Highland Avenue

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

The checkout desk. The young LIBRARIAN is stamping Daisy's
books.

LIBRARIAN
I've got that Revolutionary War
book you were asking about, Miz
Werthan. I put it aside for you.

DAISY
You're a sweet thing, Miss Jensen.

The Librarian reaches under the counter and pulls out the
book. It is enormous, more than a thousand pages.

LIBRARIAN
Everybody's just crazy about it!

Daisy eyes it dubiously as Librarian stamps it for her. -

DAISY
Well, thank you very much.

She turns from the desk and heads out the door, carrying the
huge book in the cradle of her arm.

INT. THE PIGGLY WIGGLY / PRODUCE SECTION - DAY

The store is busy with shoppers. The PRODUCE MANAGER greets
Daisy, who has her library book, her purse, and her gloves in
the shopping cart.

PRODUCE: MAN
How many peaches for you today,
Miz Werthan?

: DAISY
Three, thank you.
il.

PRODUCE MAN
You're not gonna be gettin' any
better ones the rest of the summer.
Lemme give you a few more.

DAISY
Just the three.

PRODUCE MAN
How about a nice watermelon?

Daisy shakes her head "no," puts the paper sack of peaches
into her cart, which already contains one bar of soap, one
lamb chop, and a can of peas. She walks toward the checkout
counter.

EXIT. THE BUS STOP - DAY

Across the street from where Daisy started out. The bus rolls
INTO VIEW, the doors open and Daisy emerges, carrying her
purse, the big library book, and a medium-size grocery store
bag. She walks briskly down the street.

EXT. DAISY'S DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

Daisy walking up the driveway, not quite so briskly, lugging
her parcels.

CLOSEUP OF HER FACE. JAW SET.
EXT. THE WERTHAN COMPANY - DAY

A smallish turn-of-the-century brick factory built near the -
railroad tracks. A company truck is backed up to a loading
platform. Several black men are involved in loading large
cartons of printed material into the truck. A sleek, late-
model sedan is parked in the space marked "Reserved for Mr.
Werthan." A couple of less fancy cars are parked in other
reserved spots. A mid-week, mid-morning, business-as-usual
ay. .

INT. BOOLIE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Somebody (Florine) has tried to furnish this office well. It
contains a good leather couch, a couple of English-hunt-club-
type engravings and an expensive mahogany desk. A large Vogue-
magazine~-style photograph of Florine in a fancy hat is placed
prominently. Also there are company picnic photographs,
Boolie's Yale diploma, a Bacharach-type photograph of his
father, etc. All of the above does not quite hide the fact
that this room is part of an old factory. The walls are
patchy, the windows are old, and the venetian blinds are

grubby and sagging.
12.

Boolie is at the desk and on the phone. During his phone
conversation a SHARP BELL is HEARD O.S. It RINGS
intermittently. He looks up, annoyed, then concerned, but
continues doing his business.

BOOLIE
Well, I.W., you know as well as
I do that The Werthan Company isn't
the only printing company in Atlanta.
If you want to get other bids... oh,
you did. Well... that's what Ideal
bid, huh?... Okay. You ever do
business with Ideal before?

MISS MCCLATCHEY, his secretary, all business and about 30,
appears at the door. She seems distressed. He raises his
hand, palm up, telling her to wait.

MISS MCCLATCHEY
It's important, Mr. Werthan.

BOOLIE

(on the phone)
Can you have lunch with me
tomorrow? Herrens all right?
Yes. Unh hunh. ‘Twelve thirty.
Love to Peggy and the children.

(to Miss McClatchey)
What's wrong?

MISS MCCLATCHEY
Oscar's stuck in the freight
elevator.

BOOLIE
Damn that thing!

He gets up, leaves his office. She follows.
A SERIES OF SHOTS

A. A CORRIDOR. Boolie, followed by McClatchey, hurries down
a corridor. Glass-partitioned cubbyhole offices (3 or 4) with
men in shirtsleeves at desks, on phones, etc.

B. END OF THE CORRIDOR. Boolie opens a large metal double
door and they proceed to

C. THE FACTORY. An enormous room, full of printing presses
in full swing. Various workers are operating the machines,
stacking material onto hand trucks, etc. The room is lit
mostly by the skylighted roof. Boolie and McClatchey hurry
through to
13.

D. THE FREIGHT ELEVATOR. It is about four feet above the
ground. The old corrugated tin door is open and we SEE a pair
of shoes and legs up to the knees.

: BOOLIE
Oscar?

OSCAR (0.S.)
Yassuh. Here I am.

BOOLIE
You all right?

OSCAR (O.S.)
Nawsuh. I'm stuck.

BOOLIE
I know. Fiddle with the lever.

OSCAR (0.S.)
It all fiddled out. I done
everythin' I know how.

BOOLIE
Oh, Jesus! Call Bell Elevator,
Miss McClatchey.

MISS MCCLATCHEY
I already did. They're backed up.
But they’1l be here around one.

BOOLIE
One! Did you tell them it's an
emergency? :

MISS MCCLATCHEY
You don't have to holler at me, Mr.
Werthan. I didn't break the elevator.

A small crowd of workers has gathered behind Boolie. This is
an event.

BOOLIE
You got that stuff for Davison Paxon
in there, Oscar?

OSCAR (0.S.)
Wrapped and ready to go.

BOOLIE
I told them they'd have it
yesterday. Call Bell back!

McClatchey goes off to the phone.
14.

A VOICE FROM THE CROWD
Oscar! Oscar?

Boolie turns to look and so does the CAMERA. We SEE a
SIXTYISH BLACK MAN, neat, but dressed in a shiny suit, a
frayed old white-on-white shirt and a sad-looking tie.
Clearly somebody down on his luck.

THE OLD MAN
You,hear me, Oscar?

OSCAR (O0.S.)
I hear you.

THE OLD MAN
Is there a little doo-hickey up
yonder where the gate suppose to
Close? Stickin' down a little?

OSCAR (0.S.)
Wait a minute... Yeah. Unh hunh.
It right here.

THE OLD MAN
Well, reach up and mash on it...
Mash it up till it catch.

OSCAR (0.S.)
I done it. Now what?

OLD MAN
Well, just work the lever.

A LOUD THUMP, A WHIRR OF MOTOR, and OSCAR, a black man in his
forties, dressed in a porter's uniform, appears at ground
level in the elevator, stacks of printed material behind him.
A light round of APPLAUSE, workers immediately start packing
the material onto hand trucks and moving it out.

BOOLIE
(to the Old Man)
Excuse me, do you work here?

OSCAR
Nawsah, this Hoke.

HOKE
Pleased to see you, suh...

BOOLIE
(at a loss)
Oh. Well, thank you. How did you
know about the elevator?
15.

HOKE
I used to drive for the Avondale
Dairy and they have a old sorry
elevator worse than dishyah.

OSCAR
Don' you remember? Hoke the one I
tole you about.

BOOLIE
Oh. Of course. Well, come on back
with me to my office. Hoke, is it?

HOKE
Hoke Coleburn, suh.

The following takes place. as they walk back to Boolie's
office.

BOOLIE
You're not with the Avondale Dairy
any more?

HOKE

Nosuh. They lay me off back befo'
las' November.

BOOLIE
*Long time.

HOKE
Well, Mist' Werthan, you try bein' me
and lookin' for work. They hirin'
young if they hirin' colored and they
ain' even hirin' much young seem like.

They walk in silence for a bit. Boolie is clearly not very
interested.

HOKE
Mist’ Werthan? Y'all people Jewish,
ain't you?

Boolie stops and turns around.

BOOLIE
Yes we are. Why do you ask?

HOKE
Well, suh, I'd druther drive for Jews.
People always talkin' ‘bout they
Stingy and they cheap, but don' say
none of that ‘round me.
16.

BOOLIE
Good to know you feel that way.

HOKE

woman over near Little Five Points.
What was that woman's name? I forget.
Anyway, she president of the Ladies
Auxiliary over yonder to the Ponce de

BOOLIE
I don't think so.

HOKE
Well, one day, Mist' Werthan, one day

for twenty-five cent apiece."

BOOLIE
What was her name?

HOKE
Thass what I'm askin' myself. What
was that woman's name?

They have reached BOOLIE'S OFFICE now. Miss McClatchey is
typing at her desk. Boolie proceeds to his desk and starts
signing papers. Hoke follows, talking a blue streak.

HOKE
Anyway, them's the people callin'
Jews cheap. So I say, "Yassum, I
think about it" and I get me another
job as fas' as I can.

BOOLIE
Where was that?

HOKE
Mist' Harold Stone, another Jewish
gentleman jes' like you. Judge,

17.

BOOLIE
(looks up, interested)
I knew Judge Stone.

HOKE
You doan' say! He done give me this
here suit when he finish with it.
An' this necktie, too!

BOOLIE
You drove for Judge Stone?

HOKE

Seven years to the day, nearabout.

and I say, "No thank you." I din'

BOOLIE
Judge Stone was a friend of my

HOKE

18.

BOOLIE
Well, it's a difficult situation.

HOKE
Mmmm Hmmm. She done gone 'roun' the

BOOLIE
Oh no. Nothing like that. It just

can't fire you. You understand?

HOKE

hogs to the ground at killin’ time.
And ain' no hog got away from me yet.

BOOLIE
How does twenty dollars a week sound?

HOKE
Soun' like you done hire yo' Mama a
chauffeur.
Boolie smiles with relief.

ON HOKE, pleased, but not quite sure what he's gotten himself
into.
19.

EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE - DAY

A late model sedan drives up the driveway. Boolie driving,
Hoke in the seat beside him. Both look apprehensive. They
get out of the car and walk toward the back door.

EXT. DAISY'S BEDROOM WINDOW - SAME TIME

Daisy seen in the window watching the arrival. She is not
smiling.

INT. DAISY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

The front hall. Dim light in contrast to the sun outside.
Idella is going over the floor with a carpet sweeper. She is
singing a hymn ("Are You Washed in the Blood of the Lamb"),
mostly to herself.

Boolie comes into the hall, Hoke behind him.

BOOLIE
How are you, Idella?

IDELLA
Livin'.

BOOLIE

Where's that vacuum cleaner I
brought over here?

IDELLA
In the closet.

BOOLIE
(to Hoke)
She won't touch it.

IDELLA
I would if it din' give me a shock
every time I go near it.

BOOLIE
It works for me.

IDELLA
Good. You clean up. I go down and
run yo' office.
Hoke laughs. Idella shoots him a look.

BOOLIE
Where's Mama?

IDELLA
Up yonder.
20.

BOOLIE
I guess you know who this is.

IDELLA
Mmmm Hmmm.

She goes back to her carpet sweeping.

BOOLIE
I'll be right back, Hoke.

He heads up the steps.

IDELLA
(to Hoke)
I wouldn't be in your shoes if the
Sweet Lawd Jesus come down and ask
me hisself!

ON HOKE, sizing up the situation.
INT. THE UPSTAIRS LANDING - SAME TIME
Boolie knocks on Daisy's closed bedroom door.

BOOLIE
Mama?

DAISY (0.S.)
Come in.

INT. DAISY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Daisy is seated at a small desk, checkbook open, paying bills.
She does not rise when Boolie enters. He bends over and tries
to kiss her cheek, but she pulls away.

BOOLIE
Good morning, Mama.

No answer. She continues paying bills.

BOOLIE (CONT'D)
All I'm asking is for you to come
and say hello.

DAISY

Now you listen here. Unless they
rewrote the Constitution and didn't
tell me, I still have rights. And
one of my rights is to invite who I
want -- not who you want -- into my
house. You do accept the fact that
this is my house?
21.

BOOLIE
Well, of course I do, Mama, but --

DAISY
What I do not want -- and absolutely
will not have is some -- some
chauffeur sitting in my kitchen,
gobbling up my food, running up my
Phone bill. Oh, I hate all that in
My house. On Forsyth Street we
couldn't afford them and we did for
ourselves. That's still the best way
if you ask me.

BOOLIE
Them? Afford them? You sound like
Governor Talmadge.

DAISY
Why, Boolie! What a thing to say!
I'm not prejudiced! Aren't you
ashamed.

BOOLIE
I got to get back to the plant. You
might as well try to make the best
of this, Mama.

He leaves, shitting the door.

You ain' got to concern yourself.

DAISY

The side of the house. Hoke is kneeling down examining a bed
of flowers. He has a trowel in his hand.

Daisy and Idella, wearing aprons, stand at the counter. Daisy
is making chili sauce. Idella is washing up after her.

Peeled tomatoes, onions, etc., wait on the counter. At the
moment she is boiling mason jars in a huge kettle. Hoke comes
in from the back porch.

HOKE
You know, Miz Daisy, you got a nice

She forks a boiling jar out of the cauldron. End of
conversation. She gives a small smile of triumph to Idella.
EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE - MORNING
The flowerbed. Daisy, wearing a gardening hat, is on her

knees weeding the flowerbed. Hoke walks up the driveway and
sees her.

HOKE
Mornin' Miz Daisy.

DAISY
Good morning.

HOKE

You understand?

He reluctantly gets out of the car.
HOKE
Yassum. I reckon I jes' set in the
kitchen 'till five o'clock.

DAISY
That's your affair.

Hoke goes off towards the back door, a sad stoop to his
shoulders. Daisy watches him with some satisfaction. Then
she goes back to attack her flowerbed.

INT. DAISY'S SCREEN PORCH - THE NEXT MORNING

Very sunny. Daisy sits on one of the porch chairs, reading
the morning paper. Idella enters from the house.

IDELLA
We runnin’ outta coffee and Dutch
cleanser.

DAISY
We are?

IDELLA .
Yassum and we low on silver polish,
too.

DAISY

I know... I'm fixin' to go to the
Piggly Wiggly on the trolley.

Hoke emerges from the house where he has been listening.
27.

HOKE
Now, Miz Daisy, how come you doan
let me carry you?

DAISY
No, thank you.

She puts the paper down and walks through the
LIVING ROOM to the

FRONT HALL where her straw hat sits on the hall commode. Hoke
has followed her and they talk as she pins her hat on her head
and gathers her purse and gloves. Idella, in b.g., is
straightening the living room.

. HOKE
Ain' that what Mist’ Werthan done
hire me for?

DAISY
That's his problem.

HOKE
All right den. I find somethin’
to do.

DAISY

You leave my things alone!
(calls to the
living room)

I'm gone to the market, Idella!

IDELLA (0.S.)
Yassum.

Daisy marches out the front door.
EXT. THE FRONT STEPS AND DRIVEWAY - MORNING

Bright, hot sunlight. Daisy walking briskly toward the
driveway, Hoke following.

HOKE
You know, it seem a downright shame.
That fine Oldsmobile settin' out
there in the garage. Ain' move a
inch from when Mist' Werthan rode it
over here from Mitchell Motors. Only
got nineteen miles on it. Seem like
that insurance company done give you
a whole new car for nothin’.

DAISY
That's your opinion.
28.

HOKE
Yassum. And my other opinion is a
fine rich Jewish lady like you doan
b'long draggin' up the steps of no
bus luggin’ no grocery sto' bags.
I come along and carry them fo' you.

Daisy stops walking and turns to have it out.

DAISY
I don't need you. I don't want you.
And I don't like you saying I'm rich.

HOKE
I won' say it no more then.

DAISY
Is that what you and Idella talk
about in the kitchen? Oh, I hate
all this! I hate being discussed
behind my back in my own house! I
was born on Forsyth Street and
believe you me I know the value of a
penny. My brother, Manny, brought
home a white cat one day and Papa
said we couldn't keep it because we
couldn't afford to feed it. My
sisters saved up money so I could go .
to school and be a teacher. We
didn't have anything!

: HOKE
Yassum, but look like you doin' all
right now.

If looks could kill, Hoke would now be dead. Daisy has now
reached the street, and walks as briskly as she can up the
sidewalk. Hoke retreats toward the house. Daisy sees this
and smiles slightly to herself.

EXT. THE STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Heavily green trees dapple the sunlight on this quiet

morning. Daisy continues up the sidewalk, unaware that Hoke
is behind her in the car. He idles along slowly behind her,
until she is aware of his presence. She continues walking and
he creeps along beside her during the following.

DAISY
(horrified)
What are you doing?

HOKE
Tryin' to take you to the sto'.
29.

A NEIGHBOR LADY is gardening in her front yard, rather taken
with this unusual spectacle.

THE LADY
Where are you off to this morning,
Mrs. Werthan?

DAISY
(polite and mortified)
Oh, just a little shopping.

She continues up the sidewalk, Hoke keeping pace with her.

DAISY (CONT'D)
Go away! I've ridden the trolley
with groceries plenty of times.

HOKE
Yassum, but I feel bad takin' Mist’
Werthan money for doin' nothing.
You understand?

DAISY
How much does he pay you?

HOKE
That between him and me, Miz Daisy.

DAISY
Anything over seven dollars a week
is robbery. Highway robbery.

BROKE
Specially when I don' do nothin'
but set on a stool in the kitchen
all day long.

Another car, with three or four ladies in it, is coming down
another driveway toward the street. All the ladies stare
openly. Daisy stops walking.

DAISY
All right, the Piggly Wiggly.
And then home. Nowhere else.

° HOKE
Yassum.

He stops the car, hops out and goes around to open the door
for her, but she is too quick for him and gets in by herself.

Hoke goes back around to his door and starts to get in.
30.

DAISY
Wait. You don't know how to run
this car!

HOKE

Ain' you jes' seen me do it?
Anyway, thisshere automatic. Any
‘fool can run it.

DAISY
Any fool but me, apparently.

HOKE
Ain' no need to be so hard on yoseff
now. You cain' drive, but you
probably do alotta things I cain do.
It all work out.

DAISY
The idea!

Hoke presses the accelerator and the car moves on down the
street.

INT. CAR - SAME TIME

Hoke in a wonderful mood. Daisy in full bristle on the back
seat.

HOKE
I love the smell of a new car.
Doan' you, Miz Daisy?

DAISY

I still remember everything he said.
So don't you think for even a second

HOKE

DAISY

I like to go under the speed limit.

HOKE
Yassum, but the speed limit thirty-

HOKE
Mmmm Hmmm.

DAISY
I have been driving to the Piggly
Wiggly since they put it up and
opened it for business! This isn't
the way! Go back! Go back this

HOKE :

DAISY
Get ready to turn.

HOKE
Yassum.
33.

DAISY
Look out! There's a little boy
behind that shopping cart!

HOKE
I see dat.

DAISY
Pull in next to the blue car.

. HOKE
We closer to the do' right here.

DAISY
Next to the blue car! I don't park
in the sun! It fades the upholstery!

HOKE
Yassum.

He parks the car as directed. The Piggly Wiggly has a small
conerete parking lot on the side of the store. Daisy springs
out of the back seat as soon as the car stops and slams the
car door. She heads off for the store, then stops.

DAISY

Wait a minute. Give me the car keys.
HOKE

Yassum.
DAISY

Stay right here by the car. And you
don't have to tell everybody my
business.

HOKE
Nome. Don't forget the Dutch
Cleanser now.

She fixes him with another killer look and goes off into the
grocery store.

EXT. STREET - DAY

There is a pay phone booth on the corner. Hoke puts in his
nickel and dials.

HOKE
Hello? Miz McClatchey? Hoke Colburn
here. Can I speak to him?... Mornin',

HOKE (CONT'D)
I jes' drove yo' Mama to the sto’...
Oh, she flap around a little on the

INT. THE PIGGLY WIGGLY - HOKE'S POV

Daisy, pushing cart, spots Hoke on the phone, through the
large plate glass window.

EXT. THE PHONE BOOTH - SAME TIME

HOKE
Uh oh. She done see me on the phone.
She liable to throw a fit right there
by the checkout... Yassuh. Only took

Lawd to make the worl'.

EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE - SATURDAY MORNING

It is fall now, gray skies and leaves off the trees. A
Werthan Company panel truck is parked in Daisy's driveway.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

, Oscar and his assistant from the elevator, JUNIOR, are in the
process of removing the slip covers from the upholstered
furniture and rolling down the Oriental rugs and pads. Hoke,
jacket off and sleeves rolled up, is helping them. Idella is
supervising.

OSCAR
How the old lady been treating you,
Hoke?

HOKE

She know how to pitch a fit. I
tell you that.

Oscar and Junior roar with laughter. Daisy comes into the
room wearing a fur piece, a dark hat and gloves. She does not
like hired people laughing in her house.

. DAISY
What's so funny?

HOKE
Nothin', Miz Daisy. We just
carryin' on.
35.

DAISY
Oscar and Junior have been doing my
fall cleaning for fifteen years and
they never carried on before. Leave
them alone.

HOKE
Yassun.

DAISY
And put your coat on. We're late.

HOKE
I be right there.

DAISY (0.S.)
Idella! I'm gone to Temple!

HOKE
(as he leaves the
living room)
And I right behind her, Idella.

INT. THE TEMPLE - SAME DAY

We are in the large sanctuary of the Temple, the Atlanta
Reform Jewish Congregation. The building was designed in the
twenties, and somehow this sanctuary carries a ‘sense of the
Bible as interpreted by C.B. DeMille. The room has a very
large chandelier, lots of large windows, and is decorated with
white walls and gold relief work. The Arc for the Torah
itself is all gold relief work. The whole place gives off a
scent of well-being and not too much religious warmth. .

We are approaching the end of the Saturday morning service.
The RABBI, who prefers to call himself DR. WEIL, is conducting
the service in a morning coat. There are no yarmulkes or any
other Jewish paraphernalia in sight.

The sanctuary is sparsely populated this (and every) Saturday
morning. In the front couple of rows sit the Confirmation
Class, some thirty or so tenth-graders who have to appear
every Saturday in order to get confirmed at the end of the
year.

They are standard issue high school sophomores, dressed well
and appropriately for a religious service. None of them seem
very interested in the service. Some look just plain bored,
others are miles away, and still others (girls) are passing
notes and/or giggling.

Most of the rest of the room is empty. There are a few
worshippers in pairs or alone scattered throughout.
36.

The last few rows are more populated. Here are the older

members of the congregation, mostly widows, some older men,

and a few grown sons/daughters. Daisy is in the next to the
last row, sitting very straight in the pew, her back not
touching the seat.

DR. WEIL
‘Praised and glorified be the name of
the Holy One, though He be above all
the praises which we can utter. Our
guide is He in life and our redeemer
through all eternity.

CONGREGATION
Our help cometh from Him, the Creator
of heaven and earth.

DR. WEIL
The departed whom we now remember have
entered into the peace of life eternal.
They still live on earth in the acts of
goodness they performed and in the
hearts of those who cherish their memory.
May the beauty of their life abide among
us as a loving benediction.

CONGREGATION
_ Amen.

DR. WEIL
May the Father of peace send peace to
all who mourn and comfort the bereaved

among us.
, CONGREGATION
Amen.
The CHOIR, 0.S., now SINGS.
CHOIR

May the words of my ‘mouth

And the meditations of my heart

Be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord,
My strength and my redeemer.

Amen. Amen. Amen.

The service is over. The congregation, Daisy included, files
out the rear door. Daisy is walking with her friends, BEULAH
and MIRIAM.
37.

EXT. THE TEMPLE - SAME TIME

The front elevator of the building. It is a clear autumn day.
Daisy, Miriam and Beulah come out of the building. Daisy is
wearing her little social smile, which suddenly vanishes from
her face.

EXT. FRONT OF THE TEMPLE - SAME TIME - DAISY'S POV

Her car, Hoke standing politely by the passenger door in the
rear, is directly in front of the building. A couple of other
chauffeur-driven sedans are behind it.

Daisy scurries down the steps as fast as she can. She waves
goodbye to her friends, gets in the car, sitting up very
straight and making sure she slams the door for herself.

DAISY
I can get myself in. Just go.
Hurry up out of here!

HOKE
Yassum.

Hoke, confused, scurries around to the driver's seat and sets
the car into gear.

The car moves down the driveway and into Saturday traffic.
INT. CAR - SAME TIME
DAISY

I didn't say speed. I said get
me away from here.

HOKE
Somethin’ wrong back yonder?
DAISY
No.
HOKE
Somethin' I done?
DAISY
No. .
(a beat)
Yes.
HOKE

I ain' done nothin'!
38.

DAISY
You had the car parked right in front
of the front door of the Temple!
Like I was the Queen of Romania!
Everybody saw you! Didn't I tell you
to wait for me in the back?

HOKE
I jes' tryin' to be nice. They two
other chauffeurs right behind me.

DAISY
You made me look like a fool. A
g.d. fool.

HOKE
Lawd knows you ain' no fool, Miz
Daisy.

DAISY

Slow down. Miriam and Beulah and
them, I could see what they were
thinking when we came out of services.

HOKE
What that?

DAISY
That I'm trying to pretend I'm rich.

HOKE
You is rich, Miz Daisy!

. DAISY
No I'm not. And nobody can ever say
I put on airs. On Forsyth Street we
only had meat once a week. We made a
meal off of grits and gravy. I taught
the fifth grade at the Crew Street
School. I did without plenty of times,
I can tell you.

HOKE
And now you doin' with. What so
terrible in that?

DAISY
You! Why do I talk to you? You don't
understand me.
39.

HOKE
Nome, I don't. I truly don't. ‘Cause
if I ever was to get ahold of what you
got, I be shakin' it around for
everybody in the worl' to see.

DAISY
That's vulgar! Don't talk to me!

Hoke. mutters something under his breath.

DAISY (CONT'D)
What? What did you say? I heard that!

HOKE
Miz Daisy, you needs a chauffeur and
Lawd know, I needs a job. Less jes'
leave it at dat.

They eye each other warily in the rearview mirror.
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Pitch black dark. Suddenly an electric light snaps on. We
are in Daisy's DINING ROOM. It is very early in the morning.
Daisy is wearing her winter bathrobe and warm slippers. She
is concerned. We SEE her go through the drawers of her
buffet. She isn't finding what she's looking for. We FOLLOW
DAISY into

THE PANTRY CLOSET

where she pulls an overhead light string. The pantry is a

walk-in closet. There are numerous cans and preserved goods
on the shelves. Daisy looks at the cans, suddenly pushes one
ox two aside. Suddenly there is an odd look of triumph on her
ace.

EXT. BOLLIE'S HOUSE - A WINTER MORNING - 1949

ESTABLISHING SHOT of a handsome Colonial set well back from
the road.

INT. BOOLIE'S HOUSE / THE DOWNSTAIRS HALL - EARLY MORNING

The hall is decorated in English Country house fashion. Lots
of old pieces and Williamsburg-y wallpaper. There is a Queen
Anne telephone table with appropriate chair. The PHONE is
RINGING (loudly). Florine comes into the hall to answer it.
She is wearing a winter dressing gown with long flowing
sleeves.
40.

FLORINE
Hello?... Wait a minute, Mother
Werthan. I'll get him for you...
No trouble. He's right here.

We FOLLOW FLORINE a few steps to
THE BREAKFAST ROOM

where Bollie, shirt and tie, but no jacket, sits at a built-in
breakfast booth eating his bacon and eggs. A uniformed black
maid is pouring him a second cup of coffee.

FLORINE
Guess who?

BOOLIE
(looking at his watch)
My Lord!

Florine sits back down at the table and picks up the women's
page of the paper. We FOLLOW BOOLIE back to

THE HALL
Boolie stands by the table and picks up the receiver.

BOOLIE
Good morning, Mama. What's the :
matter?... No, I don't always think
something's the matter when you call.
It's just when you call so early in
the morning... What? Mama, you're
talking so fast I... What? All right.
All right. I'11 come by on my way to
work. I'll be there as soon as I can.

He hangs up the phone. Goes back to
THE BREAKFAST ROOM

BOOLIE
I better go on over there.
FLORINE
Bye.
BOOLIE

Come on, honey.

FLORINE
It's not healthy for you to rush like
this in the morning.
41.

BOOLIE
(getting into
his jacket)
I eat too much anyway. And it sounds
like she needs me. .

FLORINE
When doesn't it?

She smiles at him, lifts her face to be kissed.

FLORINE (CONT'D)
Give Mother Werthan my love.

He hurries out and she picks up the women's page of the paper,
lights a cigarette and calls into the kitchen.

FLORINE (CONT'D)
Coffee, Gaynell!

INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - MORNING
Daisy, still in her bathrobe, paces back and forth, looking

out of the window. In a minute or so, Boolie comes through
the door.

BOOLIE
I didn't expect to find you in one
piece.

DAISY

I wanted you to be here when he comes.
I wanted you to hear it for yourself.

BOOLTE
Hear what? What is going on?
DAISY
He's stealing from me.
BOOLIE
Hoke? Are you sure?
DAISY
I don't make empty accusations. I
have proof!
BOOLIE
What proof?
DAISY
This!

She triumphantly pulls an empty can of salmon out of her robe
pocket.
42.

DAISY (CONT'D)
I caught him red-handed! I found
this hidden in the garbage pail
under some coffee grounds.

BOOLIE
You mean he stole a can of salmon?

DAISY
Here it is! Oh, I knew. I knew
something was funny. They all take
things, you know. So I counted.

BOOLIE
You counted?

DAISY

The silverware first and then the
linen dinner napkins and then I went
into the pantry. I turned on the
light and the first thing that caught
my eye was a hole behind the corned
beef. And I knew right away. There
were only eight cans of salmon. I
had nine. Three for a dollar on sale.

BOOLIE
Very clever, Mama. You made me miss
my breakfast and be late for a
meeting at the bank for a thirty-three
cent can of salmon.

He jams his hand into his pocket and pulls out some bills.

BOOLIE (CONT'D)
Here. You want thirty-three cents?
Here's a dollar! Here's ten dollars!
Buy a pantry full of salmon.

DAISY
Why, Boolie! The idea! Waving money
at me like I don't know what! I don't
want the money. I want my things.

BOOLIE
One can of salmon?

DAISY
Well, it was mine! I bought it and I
put it there and he went into my
pantry and just took it and he never
said a word. I leave him plenty of
food every day and I always tell him
exactly what it is. They are like
having children in the house.

(MORE )
43.

DAISY (CONT'D)
They want something so they just take
it. Not a smidgin of manners. No
conscience. He'll never admit this.
"Nome,"" he'll say. "I doan know
nothin' ‘bout that." And I don't like
it! I don't like living this way! I
have no privacy!

BOOLIE
Mama!

DAISY
Go ahead. Defend him. You always do.

BOOLIE
All right. I give up. You want to
drive yourself again, you just go
ahead and arrange it with the
insurance company. Take your blessed
trolley. Buy yourself a taxicab.
Anything you want. Just leave me out
of it.

DAISY
Boolie...

EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

Idella and Hoke walking up the driveway to work. Both are

HOKE
What you 'spect he's doin' here this

They exchange looks.
INT. DAISY'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Hoke comes in from the back hall.

He pulls a small paper bag from his pocket.

Oh, Miz Daisy. Yestiddy when you out

salmon. I know you say eat de leff
over pork chops, but they stiff.
Here, I done buy you another can.
You want me to put it in the pantry
fo' you?

DAISY
Yes, thank you, Hoke.

HOKE
I be right with you, Mist' Werthan.

Hoke goes off to the kitchen. Daisy looks at the empty can in
her hand.

DAISY
(trying for dignity)
Well, I got to get dressed now.
"Bye, son,

She pecks Boolie on the cheek and heads up the stairs. He
looks after her with a little smile breaking across his face.

INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE DEN - DAY - APRIL

It is Saturday afternoon. Daisy sits in a comfortable chair.
She is listening to a period console RADIO which sits on a
nearby table. It's the Saturday broadcast of the Met. The
sextet from "Lucia di Lammermoor" is BLASTING forth and Daisy
hums along happily as she does a bit of crewel work. Hoke,
passing in the hall, stands a minute in the open door frame,
smiling at what he sees.

EXT. CREST CEMETERY - DAY - MAY, 1951

A full, fuzzy-green, warm morning. Although this is a
cemetery, it is not depressing -- not today, anyway, in the
bright sunlight. The red-clay Georgia soil looks particularly
soft.

Daisy's car is parked off to the side of one of the narrow
roadways. The car is not quite so new now, but still well-
kept. Hoke is carefully buffing the front grillwork with his
trusty old chamois cloth. We can SEE the Georgia license
plate which reads 1951, so a couple of years have passed since
the last scene.
45.

Twenty feet or so from him, Daisy is kneeling by a well-tended
grave. The headstone reads "WERTHAN." The small stone at the
foot on one side reads "Sigmund Werthan" with his dates. The
other side is unused. Daisy is digging with her trowel,
planting verbena. Hoke ambles over.

HOKE
I jess thinkin', Miz Daisy. We bin
out heah to the cemetery three times
dis mont' already, and ain' even the
twentieth yet.

DAISY
It's good to come in nice weather.

HOKE
Yassum. Mist' Sig's grave mighty well
tended. I b'leve you the best widow
in the state of Georgia.

DAISY
Boolie's always pestering me to let
the staff out here tend to this plot.
Perpetual care they call it.

HOKE
Well, doan you do it. It right to
have somebody from the family looking
after you.

DAISY
I'll certainly never have that.
Boolie will have me in perpetual care
before I'm cold.

HOKE
Go on ‘way from here!

DAISY _
Hoke, run on back to the car and get
that pot of azaleas for me and set it
on Leo Bauer's grave.

HOKE
Miz Rose Bauer's husband?

DAISY
That's right. She asked me to bring
it out here for her. She's not very
good about coming. And I believe
today would have been Leo's birthday.

HOKE
Yassum. Where the grave at?
HOKE'S POV -

46.

DAISY
I'm not exactly sure. But I know
it's over that way on the other side
of the weeping cherry. You'll see
the headstone. Bauer.

a veritable sea of look-alike headstones.

HOKE
Yassum.

DAISY
What's the matter?

HOKE
Nothin' the matter.

He goes back to the car and gets the azaleas. Daisy goes on
with her digging.

HOKE
Miz Daisy...

DAISY
I told you, it's over on the other
side of the weeping cherry. It says
Bauer on the headstone.

HOKE
Now, how do that look?

DAISY

What are you talking about?
HOKE

I'm talkin' 'bout I cain' read.
DAISY

What?
HOKE

I cain' read.
DAISY

That's ridiculous. Anybody can read.
HOKE

Nome. Not me.
DAISY

Then how come I see you looking at the
paper all the time?
47.

HOKE
Thass it. Jes' lookin'. I dope out
what's happenin’ from the pictures
bes' I can.

DAISY
You know your letters, don't you?

HOKE
My ABC's? Yassum, pretty good. I
jes' cain' read.

DAISY
Stop saying that. It's making me mad.
If you know your letters then you can
read. You just don't know you can
read. I taught some of the stupidest
children God ever put on the face of
this earth and all of them could read
enough to find a name on a tombstone.
The name is Bauer. Buh buh buh buh
buh Bauer. What does that buh letter
sound like?

HOKE
Soun' like a B.

DAISY
Of course. Buh Bauer. Er er er er
er. BauER. That's the last part.
What letter sounds like er?

HOKE

An R?
DAISY

So the first letter is a --
HOKE

B.
DAISY

And the last letter is an --
HOKE

R.
DAISY

B-R.. B-R. B-R. Buh-err. Buh-err.
It even sounds like Bauer, doesn't it?

HOKE
Sho' do, Miz Daisy. Thass it?
DAISY
That's it. Now go on over there like
I told you in the first place and
look for a headstone with a B at the
beginning and an R at the end and
that will be Bauer. :
HOKE .
We ain' gon' worry ‘bout what come in
the middle?

DAISY
Not right now. This will be enough
for you to find it. Go on now.

HOKE
Yassum.

DAISY
And don't come back here telling me
you can't do it. Because you can.

EXT. THE CEMETERY - SAME TIME

We FOLLOW HOKE on his walk past the weeping cherry tree,
carrying the potted azalea in front of him. He is cautious,
but excited. The headstones loom in front of him, somehow
suddenly menacing. But he proceeds. And, sure enough, there
it is -- BAUER. . .

He silently mouths the Buh and the Er and places the azaleas
gently in front of the headstone. A big moment for him.
Then, walking quickly, he heads back to where Daisy is
finishing up her digging and collecting her things.

HOKE
Miz Daisy...

DAISY
Yes?

HOKE

I sure 'preciate this, Miz Daisy.

DAISY
Don't be ridiculous! I didn't do
anything. Now, let's get all this
pack to the car. I'm burning up out
ere.

He gathers her digging tools and her blanket and they walk
together towards the car, Hoke holding her elbow to keep her

from tripping.

EXT. BOOLIE'S HOUSE - CHRISTMAS MORNING, 1953
ESTABLISHING SHOT - house all done up for Christmas.
INT. BOOLIE'S HOUSE / THE DEN - SAME TIME

We HEAR Eartha Kitt SINGING "Santa Baby" and we SEE we are in
a small room off the living room, furnished like a Georgia
decorator's idea of an English club. The mantelpiece and
mirror above it are currently supporting a large display of
gheiepmas cards. One of them reads in bold letters, "So Long
1953!

Boolie, wearing a long-sleeved cashmere pullover and an open
shirt, is going through a pile of long-playing Christmas
records. His cabinet hi-fidelity record player is the very
latest thing, circa 1953. ‘The record jackets we see are
albums by Bing Crosby, Rosemary Clooney, Hugo Winterhalter,
etc., none of them particularly religious in content. Through
the open double doors we can just glimpse a portion of a huge
floor-to-ceiling Christmas tree and a mound of wrapped
presents at the base.

0.S. we HEAR Florine's inimitable VOICE.

FLORINE (0.S.)
Of course I told you! Of course
I told you!

And we HEAR a second, MUFFLED VOICE rising in protest.

FLORINE (0.S.)
Now, how can I be expected to buy it
if you don't write it down!

More muffle, escalated.

FLORINE (0.S.)
Honey! Boolie! I need you!

BOOLIE
Be right there!

And we FOLLOW HIM through the back hall to the
KITCHEN

An early fifties dream of a kitchen, newly appointed. Every
surface contains the makings of a Christmas party-to-be. A
large baked ham, unsliced, various bottles of liquor, makings
for canapes, etc., etc. The current bone of contention is a
large cut glass bowl full of sliced oranges and bananas.
Florine, in slacks and a silk blouse, peers into the bowl.
KATIE BELL, the current cook, black and young, is cowering by
the sink.
50.

FLORINE
I told you. I told you a million
times, Katie Bell. Write it down.

KATIE BELL
Yassum.

FLORINE
More I cannot do.
(to Boolie)
We're out of coconut.

BOOLIE
(the peacemaker)
I'm sure we can manage, Katie Bell.

KATIE BELL
I tole her.

FLORINE
But you didn't write it down! I don't
need to stand around and listen to
excuses on Christmas Day. Maybe you
can figure out how to serve ambrosia
to fifty people without coconut. I
give up.

Head high, she marches out of the kitchen.

BOOLIE
(to Katie Bell)
I'll call Mama. She has the whole
Piggly Wiggly in her pantry.

Katie Bell smiles weakly, a little cheered. Boolie goes to
the

CENTER HALL
He stands by the telephone table and dials.

BOOLIE
Mama? Merry Christmas. Listen, do
Florine a favor, all right? She's
having a fit and the grocery store is
closed today. You got a package of
coconut in your pantry? ... Would you
bring it when you come? Many thanks.
See you anon, Mama. Ho ho ho!

He hangs up the phone and bounds up the
CURVED STAIRWAY, baby-blue carpeting, calling as he goes:
51.

BOOLIE
Honey! Hey, Honey!

He enters the
MASTER BEDROOM

a fancy, French Provincial affair with a bay window, a chaise
longue, etc.

BOOLIE
Florine! Florine!

FLORINE (0.S.)
In here.

He goes back out into the hall and enters
A SECOND BEDROOM

At least it was intended to be a bedroom because it is good-
sized. This room is Florine's clothes closet. Racks of
clothes are everywhere like a fancy dress store; shoes, hats,
accessories, etc., abound. Florine is standing in front of a
three-way mirror holding a hostess skirt in front of her.

BOOLIE
Your ambrosia's saved. Mama's got
the coconut!

FLORINE
I knew she was good for something.

BOOLIE
(his face clouding)
Damn it, Florine! I told you I don't
like all this sniping at Mama. She's
an old lady, for God's sake!

Florine's eyes flash and she starts to speak, but changes her
mind and smiles coquettishly.

FLORINE
Silly! I was teasin' you! Let's
don't fight on Christmas, okay?

BOOLIE
Of course okay.

He smiles and kisses her, a kiss reflected in her many
mirrors.
52.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET SCENE - CHRISTMAS NIGHT

MUSIC OVER. Rosemary Clooney "Counting My Blessings" or some
such thing. We are SEEING well-to-do suburban streets from
the POV OF AN AUTOMOBILE. Lots of outdoor Christmas
decorations, lights, etc.

INT. DAISY'S CAR - SAME TIME

Hoke is driving. Daisy sits in her customary position in the
back. She is not in a festive mood.

HOKE
Oooooh at them lit up decorations!

Christmas to anybody.

HOKE

DAISY
I don't wonder. You're the only
Christian in the place!

HOKE
‘Cept they got that new cook.

DAISY
Florine never could keep help. Of
course, it's none of my affair.

HOKE

DAISY
Too much running around, if you ask

Junior League that! As if any one of
them would ever give her the time of

HOKE
I know dat.

DAISY
Then why did you?

: HOKE

54.

EXT. BOOLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Hoke turns the car into the driveway. Several cars are
already in the turnaround, indicating a party in progress.
Perched in a dogwood tree, near the road, is a Rudolph-the-Red-
Nosed-Reindeer facsimile, nose a-blink.

HOKE
Well, looka there. Look what Miz
Florine done put in the dogwood
tree.

DAISY
Oh my Lord! If her grandfather,
old man Freitag, could see this!
What is it you say? I bet he'd jump
up out of his grave and snatch her
baldheaded.

Hoke has gotten out of the car and is going around to the
passenger door.

BOKE
Go on ‘way from here, Miz Daisy!
Jump up and snatch her baldheaded!

DAISY
wait a minute.

She takes a small package wrapped in brown paper from her
purse.

DAISY (CONT'D)
This isn't a Christmas present.

HOKE

DAISY
You know I don't give Christmas
presents.
HOKE

He unwraps the package.

HOKE
Ain' nobody never give me no book.

He reads, not without difficulty:

HOKE (CONT'D)
“Hand Writing Copy Book - Grade Five."

DAISY
I always taught out of these. I
saved a few.

HOKE
Yassum.

DAISY
It's faded but it works. It you
practice, you'll write nicely.

HOKE
Yassum.

DAISY
But you have to practice. I taught
Mayor Hartsfield out of this same
book.

HOKE
(very touched)
Thank you, Miz Daisy.

DAISY
It's not a Christmas present.

HOKE
Nome.

DAISY
Jews haven't got any business giving
Christmas presents. And you don't
need to go yapping about this to
Boolie and Florine.

HOKE ~¢
This strictly between you and me.

FLORINE (0.S.)
Merry Christmas, Mother Werthan!

We FOLLOW HOKE and DAISY'S POV to

BOOLIE'S FRONT DOORWAY

Boolie and Florine are standing in the doorway, arms around
one another. Florine is dressed in a satin gown-pants-suit

affair, reminiscent of Rosalind Russell as Auntie Mame. They
are both waving.
56.

BACK TO THE DRIVEWAY

HOKE

He takes her arm and helps her up the steps toward the house.

EXT. MITCHELL MOTORS - SAME TIME

The car heads into the dealer's lot. A large sign in the
window proclaims the arrival of the new 1955 models. Boolie
and Hoke get out of their respective doors and walk towards
the shiny new 1955 Cadillac, painted Cadillac blue and
gleaming in the sun like a jewel.
57.

BOOLIE
You know how Mama fought me, but
it's time for a trade. I bet both
of you will miss the old one, though.

HOKE
Not me, unh unh.

BOOLIE
Oh, come on. You're the only one

They are inspecting the new car now. RED MITCHELL himself,
all smiles, having made two sales, comes out to join them.

RED MITCHELL
Well, hey, Boolie! You got a gem
here. You got that payment for me,
Hoke?

ROKE
Sho' do...

BOOLIE
We'll be right in, Red.

Mitchell heads back towards the building. Boolie walks Hoke a
.little ways away.

BOOLIE (CONT'D)
For God's sake! Why didn't you just
buy it right from Mama? You'd have
saved money.
58.

HOKE
Yo' Mama in my bizness enough as it

The two cars are side-by-side in the sun, the one gleaming,

ondly.

It's a good car, all right. I guess
nobody knows that better than you.

Boolie, holding the keys to the new car and his copy of the,

Mitchell waves and goes back inside. Boolie lights a
cigarette.

picnic-making in progress.

Golden afternoon sun streams into the room, which now contains
a fifties refrigerator, a new dinette and chairs, and a cheery
wall calendar, which reads "June, 1957."

Daisy comes into the kitchen.

INT. DAISY'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

Daisy's bedroom has undergone the usual changes in the nine or
so years since we've seen it. A late model (middle fifties)
bedside radio has replaced the large pre-war one. The
wallpaper is different, though it looks very much like its
predecessor. The room is still well kept. Daisy is dressed
in traveling clothes. She is about eighty now, but still in
good health. She moves a bit more carefully.

It is early morning. The sun is recently up. A large, old-
fashioned suitcase sits open on one of the twin beds. It is
just about full. Everything is wrapped carefully in layers of
tissue paper. Daisy has been packing it for days, and the job
is just about complete.

She looks out of her front window towards the street and
frowns. She checks her wristwatch. The street again. And
she makes a decision. Chin set resolutely, she slams the
suitcase shut and snaps the various locks closed. Another
check to the street. She lifts the suitcase off the bed. It
is almost too heavy for her.

A SERIES OF SHOTS OF DAISY WITH THE SUITCASE

A. Struggling out of her bedroom door.

B. Bumping down the hall steps.

Cc. Going through the dining room.

D. Battling with the swinging door into the pantry.

E. Emerging into the back yard and half-dragging it across
the driveway.

EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE DRIVEWAY AND GARAGE - SAME TIME

A beautiful, soft, early summer morning. Birds singing,
Daisy's garden is in gentle bloom. All in contrast to Daisy's
rising irritation. She looks toward the street, pushes a
stray wisp of hair back under its net and goes resolutely back
into the house.

INT. DAISY'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Daisy enters the kitchen. A shoebox sits open on the table.
It contains various components of the picnic lunch, all
carefully wrapped in waxed paper. Daisy opens the
refrigerator, gets a couple more wrapped packages and puts
them in the shoebox. She closes the box and wraps it with a
rubber band, irritation still mounting. She gathers it, and a
good-sized, fancily-wrapped gift box, and heads out the back
door again.

sits straight in the seat, ready to travel.

I was thinking about the first time
I ever went to Mobile. It was
Walter's wedding. 1888.

HOKE
1888! You weren't nothing but a
little child!

DAISY
I was twelve. We went on the train.
And I was so excited. I'd never been
in a wedding party and I'd never seen
the ocean. Papa said it was the Gulf
of Mexico and not the ocean, but it
was all the same to me. I remember we
were at a picnic somewhere -- somebody
must have taken us bathing -- and I
asked Papa if it was all right to dip
my hand in the water. He laughed
because I was so timid. And then I
tasted the salt water on my fingers.
Isn't it silly to remember that?
66.

HOKE
No sillier than most of what folks
remember.

A STATE PATROL CAR pulls up alongside the parked car. TWO
TROOPERS in uniform are in the front seat.

TROOPER
(to Hoke)
Hey, boy!

Hoke looks at him evenly.

TROOPER (CONT'D)
What do you think you're doing with
this car?

DAISY
(also calm but angry)
This is my car, officer.

The Trooper gets out of the patrol car and walks over.

TROOPER
Yes, ma'am. Can I see the
registration, please.
(to Hoke)
And your license, boy.

Hoke produces both the registration from the glove compartment
and the license from his wallet. The Trooper studies both.

TROOPER
(to Daisy)
What's this name? Wetheran?
DAISY
Werthan.
TROOPER

Werthan. Never heard that one before.
What kind of a name is that?

DAISY
It's of German derivation.

TROOPER
German, hunh? Coulda fooled me. I
thought it was a Jew name.

The other Trooper smirks in the patrol car. The First Trooper
tips his hat to Daisy and they drive away.
67.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATER

Daisy's car, traveling, passes an old pickup, headed the other
way. The pickup, a white farmer family, parents, grandparents
and children, dressed in overalls and simple country clothes.

CLOSEUP OF HUSBAND AND WIFE exchanging silent glance at the
sight of Daisy's chauffeur-driven car.

EXT. STATE DIVIDE - DAY
Marker says "Entering Alabama." Daisy's car travels by.
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Deep country, cotton fields, an occasional snack, a less
occasional car.

INT. DAISY'S CAR - DAY

HOKE
You talkin' ‘bout first time before.
I tell you 'bout the first time I
ever leave the state of Georgia?

DAISY
When was that?

HOKE
A few minutes back.

DAISY
Go on!

HOKE

Thass right. First time. My daughter,
she married to a Pullman porter on the
N.C. & St. L., you know, and she all
the time goin' -- Detroit, New York,
St. Louis -- talkin' 'bout snow up
aroun' her waist and ridin' in de
subway car and I say, "Well, that very
nice, Tommie Lee, but I jes' doan feel
the need." So dis it, Miz Daisy, and
I got to tell you, Alabama ain’ lookin'
like much so far.

DAISY
It's nicer the other side of
Montgomery.

HOKE

If you say so. Pass me up one of
them peaches, please ma'am.
68.

She reaches into the shoebox. A road sign catches her eye.

DAISY
Oh my God!

HOKE
What happen?

DAISY

That sign said Phenix City -- thirty
miles. We're not supposed to go to
Phenix City. We're going the wrong
way! Oh my God!

HOKE

Maybe you done read it wrong.
DAISY

I didn't. Stop the car! Stop the

car!
EXT. ROADSIDE - SAME TIME

Hoke swerves off the road, next to a field. The mood is
tense, in contrast to the peaceful lunch stop.

INT. DAISY'S CAR - SAME TIME
Daisy, very agitated, wrestles with the map on her lap.
DAISY
Here! Here! You took the wrong turn
at Opelika.

He takes the map and reads it.

. BROKE
You took it wid me. And you readin’

the map!

DAISY
I was getting the lunch. Go on back.
Oh my God!

HOKE
It ain' been thirty minutes since we
turn.

DAISY

I'm such a fool! I didn't have any
business coming in the car by myself
with just you. Boolie made me! I
should have come on the train. I'd be
safe there. I just should have come
on the train.
69.

HOKE
Yassum. You sho' shouldda'.

SERIES OF SHOTS
1. DAISY'S CAR pulling out into the road.

2. DAISY'S CAR traveling through an Alabama country town, a
square, a courthouse, white people, black people clustered
separately on benches, etc., watching the fine car pass
through, an event.

3. INT. CAR. No conversation. It's getting hot and sticky.
Late afternoon now.

4. EXT. COUNTRY GAS STATION - NEAR DUSK. Daisy's car pulled
up to the pump. A man in overalls fills the tank. Daisy
emerges from the ladies' room, a distasteful look on her face,
regarding the condition inside.

5. EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DARK. Daisy's car still heading
towards Mobile.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Hoke driving, Daisy in her seat, both somewhat slumped. They
are tired. It's a humid, dark night. Large moths and small
insects fly at the windshield.

DAISY
They fixed crab for me! Minnie
always fixes crab! They go to so
much trouble! It's all ruined by now!

Oh Lord!
HOKE

We got to pull over, Miz Daisy.
DAISY

Is something wrong with the car?
HOKE

Nome. I got to be'xcused.
DAISY

What?
HOKE

I got to make water.

DAISY
You should have thought of that back
at the Standard Oil station.
70.

HOKE
Colored cain' use the toilet at no
Standard Oil. You know dat.

DAISY
Well, there's no time to stop.
We'll be in Mobile soon. You can
wait.

. HOKE
Yassum.
{a beat)
Nome.

EXT. ROAD - SAME TIME
Daisy's car pulls abruptly to the side of the road.
INT. CAR - SAME TIME ‘

DAISY
I told you to wait!

HOKE
Yassum. I hear you. How you think I
feel havin' to ax you when can I make
my water like I some damn dog?

DAISY :
Why, Hoke! I'd be ashamed!

HOKE
I ain' no dog and.I ain' no chile and
I ain' just a back of the neck you
look at while you going wherever you
want to go. I aman, nearly seventy-
two years old, and I know when my
bladder full and I gettin' out dis car
and goin' off down the road like I got
to do. And I'm takin' the car key dis
time. And that's the end of it!

He gets out of the car, shutting the door sharply behind hin.
ON DAISY, sitting straight in her seat, lips pursed. Dark
country night silence. A DOG BARKS in the distance. She
rolls down the wiridow.

DAISY
Hoke!

She waits a second, then calls again, less angrily.

DAISY (CONT'D)
Hoke!
71.

No answer. Silence. Darkness. COUNTRY SOUNDS. She is
becoming frightened.

- DAISY (CONT'D)
Hoke!

She starts to get out of the car, when suddenly a man appears
in the shadowy dark. She is frightened for a moment, but
realizes it is Hoke come back.

HOKE
You all right in there, Miz Daisy?

Her face floods with relief, but not for long. Soon she is
her old snappish self.

DAISY
Of course I am!

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DUSK
INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL / BOOLIE & FLORINE'S ROOM - DUSK

A standard twin-bedded double room. Nicely furnished, but not
very large. A room air conditioner hums away. White gauzy
curtains billow in front of it. Open suitcases on the luggage
rack and bureau.

Boolie, wearing boxer shorts, undershirt, long socks and
garters, is stretched out on one of the beds, talking on the
telephone, which sits on a table between the beds.

During his conversation, Florine emerges from the bathroom.
She is dressed in her best evening outfit -- a killer of a
summer city dress (a sack dress? one with a balloon skirt? --
whatever Kay Kendall would have worn in 1957).

BOOLIE

Yes. I'm calling Mobile, Alabama.
Adams 4-7893. That's Adams. I don't
know what digits. Wait a minute.
23. 234-7893. Person to person.
Mr. Walter Woolf. No, wait, Operator.
Make that station to station.

(to Florine)
It'll take forever to get Uncle Walter
to the phone.

Florine, intent on her mirror image, shrugs.

BOOLIE (CONT'D)
(on the phone)
Yeah. Hey! Is this Slick? Hey,
Slick! It's Boolie! Unh hunh.
Congratulations on your Dad's big day.
72.

INT. UNCLE WALTER'S HOUSE / THE LIVING ROOM - TWILIGHT

An unpretentious, comfortable Mobile living room -- not nearly
as well-to-do as Daisy's house in Atlanta. SLICK, Uncle
Walter's son, is a sixtyish small man, dressed in short-sleeve
white shirt, no tie, etc. He is talking on the phone with
Boolie. In the b.g. are UNCLE WALTER, blind and ninety, but
the possessor of great vitality. He happens to strongly
resemble his sister, Daisy. He is ensconced in his favorite
living room chair, a pile of wrapped presents, Daisy's
included, on a table nearby. He is surrounded by various
children, grandchildren and relatives, including Daisy and her
Slightly older sister, NONIE.

Slick is having trouble hearing Boolie over the b.g. NOISE.

SLICK
Well, thank you. Thank you,
Boolie.
(he beckons to Daisy)
Aunt Daisy, it's Boolie calling.

ON DAISY

A prim smile. She's glad her son is doing the right thing.
She leaves the relatives and takes the phone from Slick.

DAISY
Hello. Hey, son. Uncle Walter
appreciates your call. I don't
think he can come to the phone.

INT. BOOLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

BOOLIE
(on phone)
Fine. How is Hoke? —

INT. WALTER'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

DAISY
What do you mean? How should he be?

Uncle Walter's daughter emerges from the kitchen bearing a
large iced angel food cake, aglow with candles. An excited
hush falls over the family and the singing of "Happy Birthday"
starts.

DAISY (CONT'D)
I have to hang up, Boolie. I'll tell
him. Yes, we will. All right. You,
too. Bye.

The cake procession and the singing continue.
73.

ON UNCLE WALTER, his blind, pink face lit by the glow of
ninety candles.

ON DAISY, also lit by the candles, her face soft with love and
pride for the occasion. She looks across the room.

DAISY'S POV

Hoke standing by the kitchen door with MINNIE and a couple of
other family servants. Hoke nods gravely at Daisy,
acknowledging the importance of the moment.

ON DAISY. She nods imperceptibly, but gratefully, back at
Hoke, still lit by the candles.

ON UNCLE WALTER, guided by Slick, leans over to blow the
candles out.

EXT. THE WERTHAN COMPANY - DAY

The same exterior, but with a few changes. A very large
billboard in front of the factory entrance reads:
"CONSTRUCTION BY A. R. EDWARDS, INC. - COMPLETION FALL 1962."
The rest of the old Werthan plant and the projected modern
addition at the rear.

The Cadillac that was driven to Mobile pulls into an empty
space. It is older now and a little worse for wear, but it is
kept well. It now belongs to Hoke. He emerges from the car,
a bit greyer, but spry. He is up in his seventies. He waves
to some men on the loading dock, who wave back. He heads into
the building.

INT. THE WERTHAN COMPANY / THE RECEPTION AREA - DAY

The receptionist waves Hoke in and he proceeds down the
corridor to

MISS MCCLATCHEY'S DESK

where she is seated, typing letters. Boolie's voice is HEARD
on the DICTAPHONE machine by her side. She types as fast as
he talks. When she sees Hoke she smiles, turns off her
machine.

: MCCLATCHEY .
Well, good morning to you.

HOKE
Can I see him?

MCCLATCHEY
He's out there with the construction.
Best toy he ever had.
74.
HOKE
I know that's the truth.
‘He walks back down the hall and through the

FACTORY, which looks pretty much as it did fourteen years
before, past the same old

FREIGHT ELEVATOR with the same old corrugated tin door.
Oscar, older now, is unloading full hand carts.

OSCAR
Hey, my man!

HOKE
They ain' give you a new elevator
yet?

OSCAR

You don't see one, do you?

HOKE
Well all right.

He proceeds through the factory and out a rear door.
EXT. REAR OF WERTHAN COMPANY - DAY

The early stages of construction. Concrete poured on first
floor and I-beams being put in place. Boolie, wearing hard
hat and expensive suit, talking to CONSTRUCTION WORKERS.
Boolie is a bit paunchier and balder.

BOOLIE
Eddie, are you telling me you're
going over already?

EDDIE
No suh, Mist' Werthan. I'm just
sayin' be prepared, if you git my
meanin'.

BOOLIE
I'm prepared to spend exactly what's
in the contract and not one dime more.

EDDIE
I hear you.

Boolie sees Hoke. He moves away from the construction group.

EDDIE
(to a worker as
Boolie moves away)
They don't call 'em Jews for nothing.
75.

The other man snickers.

BOOLIE
(to Hoke)
Isn't it your day off? To what do I
owe this honor?

HOKE
Seein' ‘bout things in the
neighborhood.

BOOLIE

Well, let me show you around.
They move around to a
SIDE ELEVATION OF THE CONTRUCTION

BOOLIE
(pointing up at
empty air)
Right there's gonna be my office.
One hell of a view.

HOKE

Isn't that something?
BOOLIE

You don't seem real interested. .
HOKE

We got to talk, Mr. Werthan.
BOOLIE

What is it?
HOKE

It Mist' Sinclair Harris.
BOOLIE

My cousin Sinclair?
HOKE

His wife.
BOOLIE

HOKE

BOOLIE
She’s from Canton, Ohio.

HOKE

Yassuh. She tryin' to hire me.
BOOLIE

HOKE

‘She phone when she know Miz Daisy be
out and she say, "How are they
treating you, Hoke?" You know how
she soun', like her nose stuff up.
And I say, "Fine, Miz Harris," and
she say, "Well, if you lookin' for a
change, you know where to call."

BOOLIE
I'll be damned!
BROKE
I thought you want to know ‘bout it.
BOOLIE
I'll be God damned!
HOKE
Ain' she a mess?
(a pause)
She say name yo sal'ry.
BOOLIE
I see. And did you?
HOKE
Did I what?
BOOLIE

Name your salary.

HOKE
Now, what you think I am? I ain'

somethin' like her.

BOOLIE
But she got you to thinkin', didn't
she? :

HOKE
You might could say dat.

BOOLIE
Come on back in my office.

They head back inside the factory.
77.

INT. BOOLIE'S OFFICE - IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

The same space as before, but serious redecoration has
occurred. It is now furnished with the latest blonde mahogany
desk, coffee table, side piece, etc. The wall-to-wall
carpeting and drapes are new, too. And there is a new fashion
photo of Florine placed prominently. She has Mamie Eisenhower
bangs in it. Boolie sits at his desk, puts his feet up and
motions Hoke to sit.

BOOLIE
Name your salary.

HOKE
Dat what she say.

BOOLIE
Well, how does $65 a week sound?

HOKE
Sound pretty good. ‘Course seventy-
five sounds better.

BOOLIE
So it does. Beginning this week.

HOKE
Das mighty nice of you, Mist' Werthan.
I 'preciate it. Mist' Werthan, you
ever had people fightin’ over you?

BOOLIE
No.

HOKE
Well, I tell you. It feel good.

He smiles and walks happily out of the office.
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE DEN - DAY - MAY, 1963

Only addition to the scene is a bulky console b/w TELEVISION
set, which is ON at the moment, a soap opera in progress.

Idella and Hoke are watching avidly. Idella is shelling peas,
a paper bag for the pods and a bowl for the peas. She looks
very old and frail.

Daisy stops in the doorway.
DAISY

I don't know how y'all can look at
that.
78.

HOKE
you see it a few times, you get in
t.

DAISY

Your brains are gonna dry up. I'll
be up in my room reading. Don't
make a mess with those peas, Idella.

IDELLA
Do I ever?

Daisy goes upstairs. The two watch.
HOKE
Ain't the blonde one got a lotta
hair? How do she make it so shiny?
IDELLA
(shelling away)
Washes it in my-naise.
He looks dubious.
IDELLA (CONT'D)
Yes she do. Had about it in Life
Magazine.

: “HOKE
Don' seem human, do it?

ON THE SOAP OPERA
Two young women drinking coffee in a kitchen.

DARK-HAIRED YOUNG WOMAN

Ominous organ MUSIC.
DARK-HAIRED YOUNG WOMAN (CONT'D)
It looked to me like he was on his
way to Hope's house!
More ominous MUSIC.
ON HOKE
HOKE
Look out! Linda up to somethin’ now.
What you think, Idella?

No answer.
79.

HOKE (CONT'D)
Idella?

0.S. SOUND of BOWL hitting the floor.

We ‘SEE the bowl overturned and peas rolling out on the
Oriental rug.

ON HOKE

HOKE
Idella! Idella!

INT. AUBURN AVENUE BAPTIST CHURCH / THE SANCTUARY - DAY

This is a fairly small church, humble in contrast to Daisy's
Temple we have seen earlier. The sanctuary is about half-
filled at the moment. A funeral is in progress.

A BLACK CHOIR MEMBER - A TEEN-AGED GIRL, with a particularly
strong voice, is singing "What a Friend we Have in Jesus."
She wears a choir robe. She is standing with the rest of the
choir, but this is the solo part of the service.

A MINISTER, also black and also robed, stands nearby, just
behind a simple coffin.

A SHOT OF THE SANCTUARY reveals that the entire population is
black, except for three white people in the rear -- Daisy,
Boolie and Florine. Hoke is sitting in the pew with them, on
the aisle, next to Boolie. Everyone in the congregation holds
a printed program of events.

ON THE THREE WHITE FACES, a part of the service, but not a
part. Florine wears a stylish suit, Daisy has on a black hat
with a veil. She looks straight ahead at the singer, her face
showing no emotion. Only Hoke's face expresses his feelings,
as the four watch the solemn proceedings.

INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE KITCHEN - DAY - JULY, SAME YEAR

For the first time, the kitchen looks a bit out of date, a bit
shabby. The linoleum is clean, but a little chipped and
scruffy. An electric fry pan sits on one of the counters,

. Clearly a concession to Boolie because it is shiny new and
ebviously never used. -

Daisy is frying chicken in a large black cast iron skillet.
The cut-up chicken is on the counter as is the paper bag full
of flour. She shakes the chicken in the bag, then places it
in the hot oil skillet.

Hoke appears behind her, watching critically. Eventually he
cannot contain himself and speaks.
80.

HOKE
You fixin' to ruin it.

DAISY
What are you talking about?

HOKE
You got de skillet turn up too high
and de chicken too close together.

DAISY
Mind your business.

HOKE
It's yo' chicken.

He shrugs, walks out of the kitchen. Daisy considers a
Moment, turns the flame down.

EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE YARD - DAY

Some time later. Daisy, wearing gardening gloves, is standing
on a small kitchen stepladder, wielding a large pair of
shears, trimming a shrub. Hoke stands at the foot of: the
ladder, picking up the clippings and putting them in a nearby
wheelbarrow.

EXT. CITY SCENE - DAY - WINTER, 1964

ESTABLISHING SHOT of ice storm in progress, branches weighted
down, icicles hanging everywhere, etc.

EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE - DAY
Effects of storm visible.
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE FRONT HALL - IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING

No furniture or decoration has changed here since we first saw
it, but everything is older. Daisy is on her knees rummaging
through the lowest commode drawer. Outside the storm is
visible. The hall is dark. Daisy finds what she is looking
for, a stumpy old white candle. She shuts the drawer, gets
up, and we FOLLOW HER through

THE DARK PANTRY into

THE KITCHEN

somewhat lighter because of the windows. She lights the
candle with kitchen matches, drips wax onto a saucer, and

firms the candle in place. She heads back towards the living
room.
81.

She walks through the dark HALL. We FOLLOW HER into
THE LIVING ROOM

Only a little brighter, evidence of ice storm outside. The
room seems more cluttered, less organized than it was in 1948.
And the darkness of the morning only accentuates the somewhat
shabby aura.

Daisy goes to sit in her armchair. The current National
Geographic is on the table. She picks it up and tries to
read, but is unsuccessful in the poor light.

Suddenly she HEARS the BACK DOOR open and close. FOOTSTEPS.
She half-rises out of the chair in alarm.

DAISY
Who is it?

HOKE (0.S.)
Mornin', Miz Daisy.

DAISY
Oh, Hoke.

She sinks back into her chair with relief. Hoke comes into
the doorway. She is carrying a paper bag, and wears an
evercoat and galoshes. .

DAISY
What in the world?

HOKE
I learn to drive on ice when I
deliver milk for the Avondale Dairy.
Ain' much to it. I slip aroun' a
little comin' down Briarcliff, but
nothin' happen. Other folks bangin'
into each other like they in the
funny papers, tho'. Oh, I stop at”
the 7-11. I figure yo' stove out
and Lawd knows you got to have yo’
coffee in the morning.

She is touched.

DAISY
How sweet of you, Hoke!

He hands her a cardboard cup and sips his own.
HOKE

We ain' had no good coffee 'roun
heah since Idella pass.
82.

DAISY
Mmm Hmm. iI can fix her biscuits and
we both know how to make her fried
chicken. But nobody can make Idella's
coffee. I wonder how she did it.

HOKE
I doan' nome.

They sip silently for a moment, deep in thoughts. Then:

DAISY
Idella was lucky.

HOKE
Yassum. I ‘spec she was.

He starts out of the room.

DAISY
Where are you going?

HOKE
Put desheah things up. Take off
my overshoes.

DAISY
I didn't think you'd come today.
HOKE
What you mean? It ain' my day off,
is it? :
DAISY

Boolie called and said he couldn't

even get down his driveway. Well,

I don't know what you can do around
here except keep me company.

. HOKE
I see can I light us a fire.

He leaves the room. The next few exchanges are Daisy calling
to him in the kitchen.

DAISY
Eat anything you want out of the
ice box. It'll all spoil anyway.

HOKE (0.S.)
Yassum.

DAISY
And wipe up what you tracked onto
my kitchen floor.
83.

HOKE (0.S.)
Now, Miz Daisy, what you think I am?
A mess?

This is an old routine between them and not without affection.
Daisy smiles. The PHONE RINGS, loudly. An intrusion on the
ntimacy.

Daisy gets up to answer. She speaks as she goes to the hall.

DAISY
Yes. That's exactly what I think
you are.

HOKE

All right den. All right.
THE HALL TELEPHONE

(NOTE: The scene of following phone conversation shifts
between Daisy's hall and BOOLIE'S DEN, where he sits wearing a
cashmere sweater and a muffler. Florine can also be seen,
wearing a full-length mink coat and expensive leather gloves.]}

DAISY
Hello?

: BOOLIE

It'll all be melted by this

afternoon. They said so on the radio.
I'll be out after you as soon as I
can get down the driveway.

DAISY
Stay where you are, Boolie. Hoke is
here with me.

BOOLIE
How in the hell did he manage that?

DAISY
He's very handy. I'm fine. I don't
need a thing in the world.

BOOLIE
Hello?
(to Florine)
I must have the wrong number. I
never heard Mama say loving things
about Hoke before.

DAISY
I didn't say I love him. I said he
was handy.
84.

BOOLIE
(winking at Florine)
Uh huh.

. DAISY

Honestly, Boolie. Are you trying to
irritate me in the middle of an ice
storm?

She hangs up sharply.
ON BOOLIE as he hangs up the phone, smiling at his wife.
EXT. STREET - DAY

A traffic jam is in progress. Cars standing still, HORNS
BLARING, irritability in the air. It is early fall, but hot
and humid.

One of the cars in the stalled lane is Daisy's. It's a car we
haven't seen before -- a Cadillac sedan (circa 1960). All of
Daisy's cars, subsequent to the first Cadillac, are virtually
the same -- all "Cadillac blue" -- but, of course, Boolie
trades them in every two or three years -- a matter of equity.

At the moment Daisy is alone in her car, fanning herself with
her handkerchief, and out of sorts. She is wearing a hat and
gloves.

Hoke, walking against the traffic, reaches Daisy's car. He is
earrying his jacket. He leans into the car.

INT. DAISY'S CAR - DAY

DAISY
Well, what is it? You took so long!

HOKE
Couldn't help it. Big mess up yonder.

DAISY
What's the matter? I might as well
not go to Temple at all now!

He gets into the car.

HOKE
You cain' go to Temple today, Miz
Daisy.

DAISY

Why not? What in the world is the
matter with you?
85.

HOKE
Somebody done bomb the Temple.
DAISY
What? Bomb the Temple!
HOKE
Yassum. Dat why we stuck here so
long.
DAISY

I don't believe it!

HOKE
Dat what the policeman tell me up
yonder. Say it happen about a
half hour ago.

DAISY
Oh, no! Oh, my God! Well, was
anybody there? Were people hurt?

HOKE
Din’ say.
DAISY
Who would do such a thing?
HOKE
You know good as me. Always be the
same ones.
DAISY

Well, it's a mistake. I'm sure they
meant to bomb one of the Conservative
synagoges or the Orthodox one. The
Temple is Reform. Everybody knows
that.

HOKE .
It doan matter to them people. A Jew
is a Jew to them folks. Jes' like
light or dark, we all the same nigger.

DAISY
I can't believe it!

HOKE
Tell you what. I see can I get us
out of here.

He starts up the car, maneuvers it down the shoulder of the
road, moving past all the congestion.
86.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Daisy's car moving in lighter traffic.

INT. CAR - SAME TIME

Hoke drives. Daisy dabs at her eyes with a Kleenex.

HOKE
I know jes' how you feel, Miz Daisy.
Back down there above Macon on the
farm -- I ‘bout ten or ‘leven years

DAISY

(after a moment of
collecting herself)
why did you tell me that story?

HOKE
I doan' know. Seem like disheah mess

DAISY
Ridiculous! The Temple has nothing
to do with that!

HOKE
So you say.

DAISY
We don't even know what happened.
How do you know that policeman was
telling you the truth?

HOKE
Now, why would a policeman go and lie
"bout a thing like dat?

DAISY
Well, you never get things right
anyway.

Miz Daisy, somebody done bomb dat
Place and you know it, too.

Go on. Just go on now. I don't want

Stop talking to me!

INT. THE COMMERCE BUILDING / THE COMMERCE CLUB - DAY - SUMMER,
1966

The entire top floor of a mid-sixties Atlanta skyscraper with
a panoramic view. This is a businessman's club/restaurant,
furnished appropriately with leather chairs, paneled walls,
portraits of past presidents, etc.

There is an honorary luncheon in progress. Boolie, the
honoree, sits at the center of a raised table on a dais. Next
to him is Florine, dressed in a fashionable mini-dress and
Courreges white boots. Next to her is Daisy in her best
dress. .

WELLBORN ARKWRIGHT, the president of the Commerce Club, is
standing in his place, on the other side of Florine, holding a
large engraved silver bowl, and beckoning to Boolie. General:
applause. Boolie rises, takes the trophy, and approaches the
microphone. A cameraman gets off a few shots.

BOOLIE

Thank you, Wellborn. And thank you
all. I am deeply grateful to be
chosen Man of the Year by the Atlanta
Business Council -- an honor I've seen
bestowed on some mighty fine fellas
and which I certainly never expected
to come to me. I'm afraid the loss
here --

(he touches his hair)
-- and the gain here --

(he pats his belly)
-- have given me an air of competence
I don't possess. But I'll tell you,
I sure wish my father and grandfather
could see this. Seventy-two years ago
they opened a little hole-in-the-wall
shop on Whitehall Street with one
printing press.

(MORE)
88.

BOOLIE (CONT'D)
They managed to grow with Atlanta and
to this day, the Werthan Company
believes we want what Atlanta wants.
This award proves we must be right.
Thank you.

He holds up his trophy. Applause. He starts back to his seat
but thinks better of it.

BOOLIE (CONT'D)
One more thing. If the Jackets whup
the Dogs up in Athens Saturday
afternoon, I'll be a completely
happy man.

Laughs, lighter applause. Boolie shakes Wellborn's hand, and
goes back to his place. He kisses a delighted Florine.
Another flash bulb or two.

INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE FRONT HALL - DAY - FALL, 1966

Daisy is seated at the telephone table, dialing. Still the
same old black telephone. She dials with some difficulty.
Things have become harder for her to do.

DAISY
Hidey, Miss McClatchey. You always
recognize my voice. What a shame a
wonderful girl like you never married.
Miss McClatchey, is my son in? Oh,
no no no. Please don't call him out
of a sales meeting. Just give him a
message. Tell him I bought the
tickets for the UJA banquet. Yes, UJA
banquet ‘honoring Martin Luther King on
the seventeenth. Well, you're a sweet
thing to say so. And don't you worry.
My cousin Tillie in Chattanooga married
for the first time at fifty-seven.
‘Bye.

She places the phone in its cradle.
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE KITCHEN - DUSK - SAME DAY

Boolie comes through the back door on his way home from work.
The end of the same day. The house is quiet.

BOOLIE
Mama? Where are you?

DAISY (0.S.)
Up here.
89.

He follows her voice up the stairs into
HER BEDROOM

Daisy sits at her desk, paying bills. Her large, old-
fashioned checkbook open on her desk and a small stack of
bills neatly stacked and stamped nearby. She works
efficiently, but slowly, because it's harder to write now.
She continues her work after Boolie comes in.

BOOLIE
How are you feeling, Mama?

DAISY
Not a good question to ask somebody
nearly ninety.

BOOLIE
Well, you look fine.

DAISY
It's my ageless appeal.

. BOOLIE
Miss McClatchey gave me your message.

DAISY
Florine is invited, too.

BOOLIE
Thank you very much.

DAISY
I guess Hoke should drive us.
There'll be a crowd.

BOOLIE
Mama, we have to talk about this.

DAISY
Talk about what?

BOOLIE
The feasibility of all this.

. DAISY
Fine, you drive. I thought I was
being helpful.

BOOLIE
You know, I believe Martin Luther
King has done some mighty fine things.
90.

DAISY
Boolie, if you don't want to go, why
don't you just come right out and say

so?

BOOLIE
I want to go. You know how I feel
about him.

DAISY

Of course, but Florine --

BOOLIE
Florine has nothing to do with it.
I still have to conduct business in
this town.

DAISY
I see. The Werthan Company will go
out. of business if you attend the King
dinner.

BOOLIE
Not exactly. But a lot of men I do
business with wouldn't like it. They
might snicker a little and call me
Martin Luther Werthan behind my back --
something like that. And I'd begin to
notice that my banking business wasn't
being handled by the top dogs. Maybe
I wouldn't hear about certain lunch
meetings at the Commerce Club. And
Jack Raphael, over at Ideal Press, he's
a New York Jew instead of a Georgia Jew
and the really smart Jews come from New
York, don't they? So some of the boys
might start throwing business to Jack
instead of old Martin Luther Werthan.
I don't know. Maybe it wouldn't happen,
but that's the way it works. If we
don't use those seats, somebody else
will and the good Dr. King will never
know the difference, will he?

DAISY
If we don't use those seats? I'm not
supposed to go either?

BOOLIE
Mama, you can do whatever you want.

. DAISY
Thanks for your permission.
BOOLIE
Can I ask you something? When did you
get so fired up about Martin Luther
King? Time was, I'd have heard a
different story.

DAISY
Why, Boolie! I've never been
prejudiced and you know it!

BOOLIE
Okay. Why don't you ask Hoke to go
to the dinner with you?

DAISY .
Hoke? Don't be ridiculous! He
wouldn't go!

BOOLIE

Ask him and see.
ON DAISY'S FACE, looking up from her desk, clearly challenged.
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / DAISY'S BEDROOM - EVENING

The wallpaper is the same as we last saw (before the trip to
Mobile) but a little blotched and spotted in places. A couple
of the framed photographs on the wall are a little crooked. A
new color TV set sits on a metal stand, looking out of place.

Daisy is reflected in the mirror above her bureau. The same
mirror as at the beginning of the picture, but, of course, she
is twenty years older. Her mind is as sharp as ever, but her
body is becoming difficult to operate. She is in the process
of putting on the final touches of her evening outfit. She
takes a final check in the mirror, not especially happy with
the results, and heads out of the room.

INT. THE KITCHEN - SAME TIME

A new sink/dishwasher combination is installed. Otherwise the
room is the same. Hoke sits at the kitchen table. He wears
thickish glasses now and is squinting at the evening paper.
Daisy enters the kitchen, having added a light jacket to her
outfit.

DAISY
All right.

Hoke rises, following her out the back door, remembering to
turn out the kitchen light as he leaves.

A SERIES OF SHOTS

1. Hoke helping Daisy into the car (a car we have not seen).

DAISY
Well, it's so silly! Boolie said
you wanted to go to this dinner with
me. Did you tell him that?

HOKE

DAISY
I didn't think so. What would be the
point? You can hear him anytime --
whenever you want.

HOKE ..
You want the front do' or the side

DAISY
I think the side. Isn't it wonderful
the way things are changing?
EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL - NIGHT
Lots of cars, policemen, lights, a big event. Daisy's car
turns the corner and Hoke stops in front of the lesser-used
side door.

EXT. BILTMORE SIDE DOOR - SAME TIME

Daisy emerges from her car, slowly but head held high. Hoke
stands where he is, on his side of the car, not helping, his
head also held high. This is an enormous breech of
etiquette. Daisy proceeds into the hotel. Hoke climbs back
in the car and looks straight ahead.

ON HOKE'S immobile face.
INT. BILTMORE HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

The room is crowded with round tables, each seating eight. A
speaker's table is on a raised dais at one end of the room,
UJA banner and NAACP banner behind it. DR. KING, MRS. KING,
other black leaders seen at a distance seated amongst white
clergymen, etc., at the head table. Dr. Weil, the Temple
rabbi, is at the microphone winding up a prayer.

DR. WEIL
And we ask, Oh Lord, that You shine
favor on all Your children. None of
us here would presume to know what You
look like or even what color You are.
But we do know without doubt that

INT. DAISY'S CAR - SAME TIME

ON HOKE who still sits at the steering wheel, alone, listening
to the SPEECH on the car RADIO.

EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING - MARCH, 1970

The car that was at the UJA banquet drives up the driveway.

It now belongs to Hoke. A newer Cadillac, same color blue (a
1969-70 model) sits in the garage. Hoke pulls his car into
the garage next to the new one and emerges into the strong
clear sunlight. We SEE the EXTERIOR of Daisy's house, no
longer as freshly painted and well maintained as it was twenty
years ago. Shutters are peeling paint here and there, a
gutter has come away from the house, etc.

Hoke opens the kitchen door and we FOLLOW HIM into
97.

INT. THE KITCHEN ~ MORNING
The room is still and empty in the sunlight.
HOKE
(calling)
Mornin', Miz Daisy.
No answer.

He cocks his head, listening, something seems off to him.

HOKE (CONT'D)
Miz Daisy?

No answer. He proceeds through the kitchen and pantry into
THE DINING ROOM

where he finds all the drawers open, having been pawed
through. He hurries into

THE FRONT HALL
where the drawers in the commode are also open.
HOKE
(alarmed)
Miz Daisy?
We HEAR a THUMPING upstairs and he heads for the steps.

DAISY (0.S.)
Hoke! Hoke! Is that Hoke?

HOKE
Yassum. It's me. You all right?

DAISY (0.S.)
(coming closer)
Hoke?

Hoke looks up the staircase as Daisy makes her way slowly
down. Her hair is in disarray and her housecoat has fallen
open, the slip showing underneath.

DAISY
Hoke? Hoke?

HOKE
Yassum.

DAISY

Where did you put my papers?
98.

HOKE
What papers, Miz Daisy?

She has reached the bottom of the stairs now.

DAISY
My papers! I had them all corrected
last night and I put them in the
front so I wouldn't forget them on my
vay to school. What did you do with
them?

She lurches off unsteadily towards
THE DEN
Hoke follows, close on her heels.

HOKE
School? What are you talking 'bout?

Daisy is opening drawers and rifling through things.

DAISY
The children will be so disappointed
if I don't give them their homework
back. I always give it back the next
day. That's why they like me.

HOKE
You talking out yo' head!
DAISY
Why aren't you helping me?
HOKE
Oh Lawd! What you want me to do, Miz
Daisy? :
DAISY

Find those papers! I told you. It's
all right if you moved them. I won't
be mad with you. But I've got to get
to school now. I'll be late and who
will take care of my class?, They'll
be all alone. Oh God! Oh Goddy!

I do everything wrong.

She has tottered off toward

THE LIVING ROOM

Hoke hurries behind her and tries to get her to sit in her
easy chair, but she is intent on opening drawers and looking
for her papers.

HOKE
Set down. You ‘bout to fall and

DAISY
It doesn't matter. I'm sorry. It's
all my fault. I didn't do right!
It's so awful! Oh God!

Now you lissen heah. Ain' nothin’

DAISY
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. I

DAISY
It doesn't make any difference!

HOKE
Miz Daisy, ain’ nothin' the matter wid
you.

“DAISY

You don't know! You don't know!
What's the difference?

HOKE
Your mind done took a turn this
mornin'. Thass all.

He has been shutting drawers behind her. She has now worked
her way into

THE FRONT HALL

and is rummaging in the commode. Hoke dials a phone number
quickly.

HOKE

Lemme have ‘im, Miz McClatchey.

DAISY
Go on. Just go on now.

INT. THE WERTHAN COMPANY / BOOLIE'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

The new wing is finished and Boolie's office is very grand.
Florine has really gone wild furnishing it. Lots of chrome
and glass and large expanses of window. A framed, signed
photo of Richard Nixon sits on Boolie's desk with the other
mementoes. Boolie has longer sideburns, less hair and more
belly. He is in his early sixties -- pink, healthy,
beautifully dressed.

BOOLIE
Hey, Hoke! What can I do for you
this morning?

INT. DAISY'S HALL - SAME TIME

It's yo' Mama. She think she

The chair rocks furiously.

HOKE
You want something to cry about, I

She is less physically agitated now, but still very confused.
She is in her chair, muttering weakly.

She takes his hand.

HOKE

He stands by her chair holding her hand.
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE / DAISY'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

The blinds are up. Sun streams into the room. The bureau
drawers are open. Clothes from the closet are piled on the
bed. There is a large cardboard carton half full of things.

Florine comes out of Daisy's closet. She wears what she
considers work clothes. Vanderbilt-type jeans and a crisp
cotton shirt. She is probably in her early 60's and she
shouldn't be wearing clothes like this, but she definitely
still has her figure. Her age mostly shows in the amount of
makeup she must resort to and her hair which seems to grow
brighter and more false as she goes along. At the moment she
is carrying Daisy's old fur neck piece on a hanger. She puts
it on and looks in the mirror. It is old and scruffy and out
of fashion. She laughs at her image and tosses it into the
cardboard box.
103.

INT. CAR - DAY - NOVEMBER, 1973

Hoke, 85 years old, is seated in the passenger seat of a car.
We do not see the driver. Hoke's glasses have gotten thicker,
clsoe to Coke bottle depth now. He is wearing an overcoat
over his suit. He does not look happy. We see that the car
is traveling down a suburban street.

The car slows down as it approaches Daisy's house.

EXT. DAISY'S HOUSE / THE FRONT YARD - DAY - HOKE'S POV

A gray, fall day. A large wooden "FOR SALE" sign is stuck in
the lawn close to the street. Over it has been plastered a

EXT. PEACHTREE WOODS EXTENDED CARE FACILITY - DAY

A modern, impersonal, but well-kept structure -- mostly steel
and glass, eight or ten stories high. The parking lot is
fairly full. Boolie's Mercedes pulls into a space. Boolie
and Hoke emerge. They walk towards the front door, Boolie
holding Hoke's arm.

INT. PEACHTREE WOODS / THIRD FLOOR - DAY

A brightly lit, well-kept facility, as these places go; but, -
despite the Thanksgiving decorations, a fairly impersonal _
atmosphere. We can see the Central Nurse's Station and .
corridors shooting off from it. ,
Down the corridors are various elderly people in motorized ~
wheelchairs, walking with walkers, and, in a few cases, |
without any assistance. We SEE a VISITOR'S ROOM and a few
family clusters making Thanksgiving visits. The atmosphere is
brisk, hospitally at its best. ee
 

 

 

 

 

106.

INT. DAISY'S ROOM - DAY

A large, one-bedded room with a large glass window. Through
the window is a pleasant view of a young piney woods and a red
clay bank. The room consists of a hospital bed, a hospital
bureau, and a couple of chairs. There are several houseplants
on the window sill, the only personal touch in the room.

Daisy emerges from the bathroom wearing a neat housecoat. She
is ninety-seven years old. She is fragile now, walking with a
walker. Her hair is neatly fixed and her face composed. She
makes her way slowly to the chair by the window. When she is
almost there, we HEAR a KNOCK at the door. She does not
answer, but continues toward the chair.

Boolie peers through the door and enters the room. Hoke
follows.

BOOLIE
Happy Thanksgiving, Mama. Look who
I brought.

She looks toward Hoke. Boolie helps her into her chair.

HOKE
Mornin' Miz Daisy.

She nods. :

HOKE (CONT'D)

No response.

BOOLIE
She certainly is. She goes to
jewelry making -- how many times a

kinds of things. Pins and bracelets.
She's a regular Tiffanys.

She nods, smiles. He notices an untouched slice of pumpkin
