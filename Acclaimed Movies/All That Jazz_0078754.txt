To be on the wire is life: the

We hear Angelique applaud. CAMERA PANS down to include
Angelique. She is strikingly beautiful and is dressed in

CAMERA tracks down line of twelve girls. Joe pauses to
speak to each in turn. He reads from audition cards. Joe
Gideon ig a man who has developed a specific image.

Dressed in casual black clothes, he is a chain smoker with
a cigarette constantly drooping from the left corner of his
mouth, He ig unusually energetic -- seems to dart swiftly
from place to place. His emotions change rapidly without
transitions. Laughing, joking one moment -- then suddenly
angry (usually directed toward himself) but always accompa-

nied by a hyper-nervous energy.

Following the slates we CUT into a nightclub where the star
of the film, Davis Newman, is performing a monologue. Davis
wears jeans and a work shirt and is smoking a cigarette.
During the ensuing we will see either the three different
angles at once or will isolate each angle.

are Joe and editor, Eddie Lerner. Joe has a cup of wine
and never stops chain smoking. Also working in the room
is an eager, long-haired youth, Jonathan, the assistant
editor. At the rewind table is apprentice Stacy St. John,
a shapely, pretty 19-year old. Although we continue the
monologue here in its entirety, it will be seen in bits and
pieces against the scene.

DAVIS
You knew, man, Death is really
a hip thing now. It's...in.
But we all have very different
feelings about if. I mean,
for instance, man, to a
Catholic...Death is a pro=

else. Somebody finall
pinned Billy down said,
‘Dr. Graham, what is Heaven

no sex but a lot of golf.’ At the end of the word “golf,”
(another hit Joe manipulates the Steenbeck
on cigarette) and reverses the film back to

"really something else."
He reruns the joke to the
same place, stops the machine
and repaats the action, then
allows tne film to continue.

INT. PROJECTION ROOM. SHOT OF SCREEN, NIGHT, 12

We see a piece of the monologue sequence that has been cut
together. Over the sound of the monologue, whichever piece
of it we see:

REVERSE ANGLE TO JOE, EDDIE, JONATHAN AND STACY. KATIE TO
ENTER.

Joe sits alone, slumped in his seat, still smoking and
@rinking. Stacy sits a couple rows behind him. Eddie and
Jonathan sit at the console to the rear. The door to the
screening room opens and Kate Jagger enters. She carries
a small poodle. Hatie ig twenty-two, beautiful, a featured
dancer in a Broadway show. She wears no makeup and is
dressed in a denim suit. All look briefly to see who has
entered. By the reactions of Eddie and Jonathan, who
obviously like her, she is a familiar figure around the
cutting room. Eddie smiles and whispers.

EDDIE
Hi, Katie,

JOE
(not taking his eyes
off the screen)
Sit down, Katie.

She moves to a seat behind Joe. He acknowledges her presence
by raising his left hand, which she takes warmly, at the same
time gently kissing his neck. There is also a cool acknow~
ledgment between her and Stacy. Eagerly Katie looks at the

her one look as if to say ‘What is she laughing at?'

Can we have dinner together before
I go to the theatre? _

I can't,
KATIE
Shoulda I come over later?
JOE
We may be working very late...

I'll call.

Katie's eyes go back once more to the screen. She finds
something funny, laughs again. She touches the back of
Joe's head, then gets up and, with whispered goodbyes to
the others, she leaves. A moment later the screén goes
white, and the lights of the room come Up.

JOE
Anybody got any setter ideas?

ag though this is a favorite girl of Joe's that he has

attention to her nudity. Joe is fascinated by the meeting,
watching it at all times in the mirror, at the same time
experimenting with an eyebrow pencil. At times he and
Angelique make eye contact, both amused by the mother's
enthusiasm and her total misinterpretation of her son's

from her artificiality and amateurism, he must first break

he relentlessly critizes Victoria. :

the rehearsal again ... Victoria loses her balance on the
turns and breaks down. The dancers finish the combination.
The pianist stops. Having achieved his objective, Joe
turns crosses a couple of steps to a table, goes back and
hands her a couple of kleenex. They talk by the bar.

DANN .
Jesus Christ!

Soon the entixe company has disrobed. The boy dancers wear
only dance belts (with hats on their heads, o£ course). The
girls wear only a minimum of clothing.

It's apparent that Joe has decided that the theme of the
Number is "Casual or indifferent sexual encounters in
contempora: society": People meet -- have sex -- separate
without a residue, or even memory, of relationship. There are
various mechanical sex couplings: every variation of girls and
boys ~- boys and boys -- girls and girls -- in threes and fours
-~ and so on and so on... . .

This is certainly not what the “jury” had expected. Shock,
confusion, bewilderment read very cteazty on their faces.

The Number finishes with all the dancers in isolated areas;
caressing only themselves, loving only themselves, incapable
of making contact with any other person. There is nothing left
but self-love. :

seated almost directly opposite Joe. A model of the set

is prominently displayed in front of Joe.

JOE

(up and bright)
OK,..now you've all seen the set
and costume designs...what I'd
like to do now is read through the
script tor-the-first—time. None

NOTE: From here on the book reading sequ ence is entirely
Silent, A DUMB SHOW, except for exa' erated so ettects
involving Joe. For example, he iit Strike a match, Light

his cigarette and crack his knuckles.

The reading evokes great positive response from both the
cast and everyone else in the room except Joe and Audrey.
We see (and to remind you again ~~ do not hear a. ase
responses: laughter, applause, thigh-slapping, looks of
mutual joy and seli-satisfaction. Joe occasionally manu-
factures a sickly smile during a continuation of the
exaggerated sound effects, which further include coughing,
sniffling, heavy breathing, stubbing out cigarette in
ashtray, etc. The pleased, laughing response of the on=
lookers hag reached epic proportions, They have never
heard anything so funny. The more Joe hears of the book,
the more he realizes he and the show are in desperate
trouble. At the end of the reading, Joe forces the sick-
Test of smiles, touches his chest, massages his left arm
and closes his book. It is the last sound effect we hear.

As Joe slowly makes his way down the hall, he pauses when
he hears a woman moani loudly. The moaning comes from
a room directly across ths halfway . Curious, puzzled, he
crosses to the open door and looks in.

168 WHAT HE SEES: 168

A very old woman, practically skeletal and near death, lies
helplessly on a bed. Her moans continue.

INT. OLD WOMAN'S ROOM, JOE AND OLD WOMAN. NIGHT.

He crosses to the bed, looks at her tenderly for a moment.
Carefully he climbs onto the bed, raises the sheet to get
next to her and then enfolds her in his arms. He rocks her
gently.

JOE
I think...you are...the most
beautiful woman I have ever seen
- «eeand I love you. -

The moans subside, and she looks at him as though he has
evoked a memory from the past, He kisses her <-- as a lover.
The old woman closes her eyes and seems lost. ently, he
breaks the embrace. She opens her eyes as he rises from
the bed. He leans over her, holding her hand, caressing
her cheek. She closes her eyes slowly.

The room is quite empty. At one table sits a Middle Aged
Couple. An Attendant is mopping up. There is only one
Woman Attendant at both the food counter and the cash
register. Joe enters, without hesitation walks to the
food counter, stops at the dessert display, ‘There are
single portions of pie, whole pies as well. Picking up

a piece of lemon meringue pie, he passes the cash register,

WOMAN ATTENDANT
That will be forty cents.
(when Joe simply
walks away)
Sir!...Forty cents...

She looks bewildered as Joe crosses to a table right next
to the couple. He becomes increasingly fascinated in their
tetally mundane conversation.

with them whether we hear them or not. For instance, Penn:
"What a.finish, Joe, what a finish.” .Joe, now back on stage
with group and dancers, finishes..number. There is riotous
applause. As he leaves the arena the audience stands
continuing the ovation throughout the following.

She, too, is applauding. He walks to her; she ovens her
arms. He hesitates momentarily, then walks toward her. She
embraces him tightly. He returns the embrace. They kiss.

an even deeper embrace. Their cheeks press together,
