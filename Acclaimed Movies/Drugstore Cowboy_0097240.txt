INT. CAR DAY

An OVERHEAD VIEW of BOB HUGHES lying down in the back seat
of a 1968 Cadillac. He is looking up at the ceiling of
the car, at the camera, and his features are changing this
way and that, sometimes eeking out a giggle or an inspired
laugh, looking like some sort of wired druq addict with
thoughts racing by too fast to interpret by his features.

BOB'S VOICE
I figured I was qualified to write a book, if I
could ever sit down long enough in one place to
do it. It would be titled, A Dope Fiend's
Guide to Drug Stores, or something like that.

CLOSE VIEW of Bob's face and shifting eyes.

BOB'S VOICE
And in it the curious reader would find flights
of fancy, gems of creativity, artistry, and yes
even honest-to-goodness poetry. Of course it
would have a lot of the standard stuff, like
picking locks...

EXT. PHARMACY #1 ROOFTOP NIGHT ae
Bob sawing a hole in the roof of a closed pharmacy.

BOB'S VOICE
+ » .0r sawing holes in roofs. Yeah, sawing
holes, I liked to do that. When working away
with hand drills and saws and such, I even
thought of myself as a half-assed carpenter.

INT. CAR DAY

 

CLOSE VIEW of Bob's face in the back seat of the Cadillac.
HE CRACKS a smile and winks absentmindedly.

INT. CAR DAY **
BOB

Yeah, I think we'll give it the old beaver shot

this time.
Up in the front seat, his partners know he isn't expecting
a response. There's DIANNE, NADINE AND RICK, and all are
used to Bob being in his own little world there.
(Allow time for voice over history of each character,

like: there was Dianne. She wouldn't tell a cop shit
even if she had a mouthful.)

EXT. PORTLAND OREGON CITY STREET DAY ae

EXT, PORTLAND OREGON itt ones

The car pulls over to a curb and pushes other cars away
making room for their getaway. Bob gets out first and

casually walks down the sidewalk as if window shopping.
An OLD WOMAN walking her POODLE approaches.

BOB
Nice day, huh?

Then Bob smiles at the OLD WOMAN.

INT. PENITENTIARY DAY

Long shot of Bob walking down hallway with guard.

JAIL BARS slide open in front of Bob. He is smiling that
same SMILE.

EXT. STREET DAY

Bob walks through glass doors into a PHARMACY.

INT. PHARMACY #2 DAY

CLOSE VIEW of Rx sign, Bob steps neatly past the checkout
counter and takes a look at veterinary supplies ona
shelf.

DIANNE enters the Pharmacy. -
THE NEXT PERSON to enter the Pharmacy is NADINE, not long

out of her teens, her blouse is scanty and her skirt stops
well above the knees.
9-10-88
3.

THE FOURTH MEMBER of the group enters, RICK, the muscle.

Nadine proceeds down the store's main aisle and stops at
the perfume counter.

Rick takes a post near the entrance pretending to look
through the get well cards.

Dianne is engaged in an over the counter conversation with
the DRUGGIST. She has a pack of gum in her hand.

DIANNE
Do you have Wintogreen gum? Why don't you have
wintogreen gum?

DRUGGIST
No, ma'am, I don't believe that we carry it.

DIANNE
Could you order it?

DRUGGIST
Ma'am?

Bob gives the signal to Dianne who is peering over her
sunglasses, then scratches her rear, signaling Nadine who
goes into her act.

RICK
Help! This lady is having a seizure. She
might swallow her tongue!

Nadine SCREAMS and falls backward against a low display
case, leaving her body arched to make the most of the fact
that she's wearing a very short skirt.

She begins to convulse and jerk, trying to mimic the
symptoms of an epileptic seizure.

VIEW of the Druggist's eyes, and they are taking special
notice of Nadine's torso; he bounds over the counter to
Nadine's rescue.

Bob makes his move, quickly ducking behind the vacated
counter and dropping to his knees.

MOVING VIEW of Bob scooting along, looking for any drawer
or cabinet with a lock. Midway along the counter he finds
what he is looking for. He spies a drawer and opens it.

Dianne, spying a checkout girl on her way to the action,
COUGHS a signal to Bob to hurry up.

Bob responds to Dianne's cough and scurries back down to
the end of the counter and peeks around to see if things
are safe.
10

9-10-88

BOB'S VIEW. The checkout girl is helping the druggist
with Nadine.

Bob is satisfied that it is safe, and scurries back to the
drawer. He straightens up to his knees and begins rifling
the contents. The sweat is standing up on his forehead.
His hands start to shake and his knees quiver and jerk as
he scoots back down the aisle around the pill shelves and
into the back room.

Dianne begins to start another COUGHING FIT as the
druggist is on his way back behind the counter going to
the phone.

Bob tries the back door but it is locked. Now the
druggist is in Bob's sight and he has to operate on the
back door to the druggist's back.

Bob quietly pulls out a screwdriver and smoothly takes the
locked door off the hinges, very quietly, and leaves the
back room.

DIANNE
(to the counter girl)
Excuse me...are you too busy to take this money
for some cough syrup?

The counter girl, holding Nadine, looks at Dianne like she
is crazy and Dianne smiles for the benefit of all the
SURROUNDING CUSTOMERS, and quietly leaves.

VIEW of Nadine arched over the low display, and hearing a
distant AMBULANCE SIREN, she sits up, rearranges her
clothing and hair, tries to look embarrassed, deftly
disengages the hands of the counter girl holding her, and
walks out the door. She is followed by Rick.

The druggist and the checkout girl stand in amazement as

they leave. We see the druggist's has a nagging suspicion
that they have been HAD.

EXT. STREET DAY

Dianne leans into backseat window to kiss Bob and then
enters the driver's side of the Cadillac.

INT. CAR DAY -

Bob is in the back seat lying down.

DIANNE
How'd we do?

BOB
So, 80...

Dianne starts the engine and nervously taps the steering
wheel with her long tapered fingernails.

DIANNE
I wish they'd get a move on, I've told
them and told them to get the hell out once
we've made our goddamn move. Fuck me blue!

Bob raises up enough to look out the back window.

BOB
For Christsakes, Dianne, watch your language.
Who in the hell do you think you are, Ma Barker
or somebody?

DIANNE
Just who in the fuck do you think you are, my
father? If you can cuss, so can I goddamnit!

Bob sits up and keeps looking out the rear window, and

spots Rick and Nadine casually strolling down the
sidewalk, hand in hand, toward the car.

EXT. CAR DAY

 

Bob opens the door of the car and calls out.

BOB
Come on, come on, I said walk not crawl.

Rick and Nadine take their places in the car next to
Dianne.

INT. CAR DAY

 

NADINE
You said walk and that's what we done, walk,
can't we do nothin' right?

BOB
Yeah, I said walk, but I didn't mean you had to
window shop all along the way.

Rick grins. Dianne pulls out of the parking place.

BOB
Anybody got an outfit up there?

Dianne turns completely around, disregarding traffic.

DIANNE
Goddamnit, Bob, why do you have to fix in the
car? Can't you wait until we get home like
everybody else?
9-10-88

BOB
Shut up and watch your driving.

Bob sits up a bit and looks out the window of the car,
like a little kid with his nose pressed against the glass.

BOB'S VOICE OVER
After any kind of drug haul, everyone in the
crew indulged to the utmost. I laughed to
myself as I pictured blues or dilaudid in such
great amounts that the spoon would literally be
overflowing. Upon entering my vein the drug
would start a warm itch that would surge along
until the brain consumed it in a gentle
explosion that began in the back of the neck
and rose rapidly, until I felt such pleasure
that the whole world sympathized and took ona
soft, lofty appeal. Everything was grand then.
Your worst enemy, he wasn't so bad. The ants
in the grass, they were just doing their thing.
Everything took on the rosy hue of unlimited
success, you could do no wrong. As long as it
lasted, life was beautiful.

Dianne has been riding in the front seat swearing at the
traffic quite liberally, and a few choice four letter
words drift into Bob's quiet musings in the back seat.

BOB
(to Dianne)
Boy what a bitchy group! Fuck this, and screw
that, Dianne, what kind of an example are you
setting for the youngsters anyway?

Dianne takes her eyes off the road, turning to Bob.

DIANNE
You're goddamn lucky that I have to keep my
eyes on the road. . .

BOB
Keep your eyes on the road then.

DIANNE
.» . .and the steering wheel in my hand because
otherwise you would be a good candidate for
strangling.

BOB

Well it don't look like you are doing that
great a job of keeping your eyes on the road.

13 EXT. STREET DAY

 

The Cadillac drifts effortlessly through a red light.

EXT. APARTMENT DAY
The car slows to a halt in front of the JOSEPHINE
APARTMENTS. Bob can be seen peeking out the back window
of the car.
INT. CAR DAY
Bob turns around to see the rest of the crew.
BOB
Now, everybody. Just act cool. It's like we've

just come back from church. This being Sunday
morning, we should make it believable.

EXT. APARTMENT DAY

 

The car jumps excitedly over a bumpy drive and squeals
it's tires a little as it makes its way to the back of the
apartment building.

BOB'S VOICE
For some reason, every dope fiend in the area
could tell if you were holding.

Across the street, DAVID, a long haired hippy about
twenty-one years old, sits up in an easy chair on the
porch of his house, as if he just woke up.

BOB'S VOICE
The hangers on, the rip-off artists, that is.
Not the cops. They couldn't smell a dead rat
two feet away. But the damn dope fiend
snitches could.

At this point David does look a little like he is sniffing
the air as he puts on a shirt.

BOB'S VOICE
It didn't make any difference how careful you
were. They could sense it. They could almost
smell it.

David makes his way down the steps of his porch and sees:
Bob, Nadine, Rick and Dianne skipping from the car quickly
into their apartment.
BOB'S VOICE
They could tell by the way you drove in the
yard, by the way you hurried into the
15

9-10-88

BOB'S VOICE
(continued)
apartment, and if you made a studied, careful
approach, they could sense it even more. There
was just no way to improvise that disgusted
sick feeling of coming home with nothing.

INT. APARTMENT DAY

 

The four sitting around a coffee table that has fast food,
take-out soft drink cups on it. Bob is fishing out the
drugs.

RICK
Give me a blue.

BOB
Nadine?

NADINE
(shrugs)
Give me the same, I guess.

BOB
(smiles)
No, I don't think so, Nadine.

NADINE
Why not?

Dianne brings her head up and looks right through Nadine.

DIANNE
Nadine, you can't shoot no goddamn blue. Give
her half of one, Bob, that'll keep her in the
crapper all afternoon.

NADINE
(fighting back)
Goddamnit, I was in there just like you, I
ought to get the same as everyone else, even if
I can't shoot it all right now. I could save
it, or maybe sell it and get me a few things.

BOB
Well, Nadine, I'l] tell you, that just ain't
the way things work around here. You don't do
shit. All you've done is shag your twat, and
that ain't nothin'. It's me that's taking the
big risk. What are they going to bust you for,
having a fit in a drug store?
9-10-88

15A EXT./INT. APARTMENT DAY
cr David is walking across the lawn toward the apartment.
NADINE
Well, how about Dianne, she ain't done nothing
either?
DIANNE

Don't give her a damn thing. Kick her ass out
in the street where we found her.

BOB
No, no fair is fair, you want your fourth, you
got it, Nadine. But I ain't taking on no
apprentices and giving them a full end of my
thing. You take it and get out.

At this , Nadine looks confused, like she doesn't know
what she wants.

RICK
Goddamn you, Nadine! Take your half a blue and
shut up, shoot it and go puke awhile.

A KNOCK sounds on the door.

Quickly Dianne scoops up all the bottles and runs for the
~~ bedroom. Bob draws a forty-five automatic pistol from
under the couch cushion. Holding it at arms length
pointed at the floor, he approaches the door's peephole.

VIEW through the peephole. Bob recognizes the intruder.

BOB
What do you want, David?
DAVID
I just want to see you for a minute, Bob, let
me in.
BOB
You alone?
DAVID

Hell yes, I'm alone, what'd you think, I
brought my rat-faced granny along to hold my
hand?

Nadine and Rick are standing as if glued to the floor.

BOB
You, Nadine, pick up those spoons, outfits and
Cr that glass of water. Rick you get your goddamn

gun out and get in the bedroom and back me up.
9-10-88
10.

Both Rick and Nadine jump at his order.

Bob opens the door and points his cocked gun at the
long-haired disheveled young man.

DAVID
What the hell, pard, you finally gone
completely crazy or something?

David smiles at the ritual. He slowly steps into the
apartment and looks over Bob's shoulder to see Rick's arm
and gun protruding around the door jam of the bedroom.
Then he carefully takes off his jacket, swirls around like
a ballet dancer doing a swan number and relaxes on the
couch in a half sitting and half lying position.

DAVID
What are you holding, pard?

BOB
I ain't holding shit, David.

Bob lowers his gun and tries his best to look innocent.
BOB
I was just thinking of dropping by your place
to see if you've got any speed.
David smiles.

DAVID
Well, I got some speed.

David laughs, embarrassed somewhat.

BOB
What kind of speed you got?
DAVID
Methadrine crystal.
BOB
(grins)

You know what, David? You could have little
balls of shit wrapped up in those little
cellophane bags of yours and your answer would
always be the same, methadrine crystal.

DAVID
No, Bob, really, this is good stuff, clears
right up in the spoon, no residue, hair-raising
flash, here, you try one on the house.

Bob is skeptical.
BOB
Okay, how much you got on you right now?
DAVID
Ten grams.
Bob looks to the bedroom.
BOB
Okay, just a moment, I got to talk to Dianne
first.
INT. BEDROOM DAY xe

Bob enters and finds Dianne straddling the window sill,
still clutching her armload of small bottles. She has
heard everything in the next room and shows
dissatisfaction with the way things are turning out.

Bob grins at her sheepishly.

BOB
How about some speed, baby? The man says that
he's got methedrine crystal.

DIANNE
What do you want that goddamn speed for? You
know how ringy it makes you. It turns you into
a different person, Bob, and I don't much like
that person.

Bob holds out his hands, palms up in the age old gesture,
as if to say, "Oh, what the hell, one more time isn't
going to hurt anything." And Bob's voice takes on the
excitement of a small boy in a candy shop.

BOB
Baby, listen to me, what night is this anyway?
It's Sunday, right? How about us getting some
speed, see, and then we'll all jump in the car
and get that big fat pharmacy. You know how
these things go. When you're hot, you shoot
the works, when you're cold, you lay off a
bit. Well right now I'm hot, baby, I'm so hot
I'm burning all over.

DIANNE
Alright, buster, 1£ you're so goddamn hot why
don't you lay me down on the bed and make love
to me right now?

Bob turns away in disgust.

BOB
Oh crap, you know what I mean, Dianne. I'm hot
to steal. We can do that any goddamn time.

Bob moves away quickly and slams the bedroom door.

BOB
For Christ-sakes, you got to bring up crap like
that at a time like this?

Bob looks around as if trying to spot the answer to his
problems.

INT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAY

Rick is still holding the gun, but not pointing it at
David, they are all listening to Bob and Dianne's
conversation,

INT. BOB'S BEDROOM DAY

BOB
So, okay, I ain't been doing so good in that
department. What do you want me to do? I'm
hooked baby, I'm not like a woman. I got to be
the one that gets it up first . All you do is
think about sex, you pervert.

Dianne draws her outside leg back over the window sill
into the room.

DIANNE
Hell, how much goddamn speed you going to get
off that creep? Be sure to get enough for

all of us. And don't you ever call me a
pervert again or I'l] cut your fucking heart
out!
Bob relaxes and grins.
BOB
I know you will, baby, I know you will.
INT. LIVING ROOM DAY ek

Bob enters.

DAVID
You got any blues?
9-10-88
13.

BOB
(looks perplexed)
Hell no, I ain't got no blues! You know how
hard it is to pick up blues these days?

DAVID
How about dilaudid, you got any sixteenths?

BOB
(eyebrows go up again)
Hell no, if I had sixteenths, you think I'd be
sitting here rapping to you about some shitty
speed? Now how about some morphine. I got
some good old morphine.

DAVID

What'd you get, man, morphine sulfate, quarters
or halves?

BOB
Yeah, man, (lapsing into black jargon) I got
quarters and halves. It's got a little
atrophine in it, but. Just take you a little
old ink blotter, lay the tablets out on them in
rows, place one drop of water on each one and
the atrophine eases right off into the blotter
and you're home free. Throw the little fellers
off in the spoon and you're raring to go.

DAVID
You're crazy, man, I can't even read a stop
sign when I'm on that crap, my eyes go so far
out of focus. I ain't trading no uptown crank
for no downtown trash.

BOB
Well you know how it is these days, David.
That's all I got and all I can give.

DAVID
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, if you didn't
have nothin' more you wouldn't be even trading
off that. You think I'm dumb, man, but I'm not
as dumb as you think.

BOB
(shrugs)
What can I say.

David fusses and fumes and heads for the door. Bob just
grins at him.

BOB
Too bad we couldn't do business, pard.
9-10-88
14.

At the last second David turns from the door.

DAVID
Okay, man, how many quarter grains of morphine
you going to give me for that?

BOB
I'll hit you with nine quarters per package,
and that's just because I'm feeling good and
because you're a real standup dude. I'll even
throw in an ink blotter. How's that? I'll]
take all ten quarters from you.

Dianne comes from the bedroom and leans against the door
jam.

DAVID
You want ten, so okay, you get ten. That's
nine apiece, nine times, ten, let's see,
that's. ..

BOB
Seventy-five.

NADINE
That's ninety, Bob.

If looks could kill, Nadine is dead.

DAVID
Yeah, that's right. Ninety.

Dianne gives them all a look of complete disgust and heads
for the bedroom to get the pills.

David sneaks a glance at Nadine.

DAVID
How much you want for her, Bob?

BOB
Huh?

DAVID
How much you want for her, man, the female, the
fox.

Bob turns his pistol on Nadine while he addresses David.

BOB
You know what, sport? I'd kill that girl right
here before I'd sell her to you. What'd you
think I'm some kind of closet pimp? I never
heard of such a violation of the right of
womanhood in all my life.
9-10-88
15.

David doesn't know how to react, so he just nods
affirmatively to Bob's question.

BOB
Out of curiosity, how many bags of speed would
you give for her?

David slumped with relief and headed toward Nadine with
his hand extended, ready to feel for himself if all the
curves were real.

NADINE
You little twirp. You come one step closer to
me and I'll knock your block off.

David hesitates, draws his hand to his side and turns to
catch Bob's reaction.

Dianne saves the situation by throwing the pills on the
coffee table.

DIANNE
Pick up your stuff and go. We got some things
to do.

David picks up his stuff and heads for the door.

DAVID
I like her. I might come back sometime and see
you about trading for her.

BOB
Alright, twirpy. You do that.

Rick bolts the door behind David. Bob throws his gun on
the couch on his way to examine the goods. Nadine is
indignant.

NADINE
I ain't going to be sold like no pig in the
poke to nobody.

Bob looks up from the speed he is inspecting.

BOB
The next time you come to my aid and help me
with my arithmatic when it's unfavorable to us,
I'll drag you out and sell you to the first
one-eyed Philippino I can find, for whatever
he'll goddamn give me. Even if it's only a
pack of chewing gum.

Nadine turns away and goes outside.
Rick goes after her.

LIEUTENANT GENTRY, TROUSINSKI, and a handful of other
police are investigating Bob's work. OUR VIEW moves in

foot off the floor or is chewing on a golf tee.)

EXT. APARTMENT #1 DAY

 

Rick and Nadine are talking.

RICK
Listen, Nadine. Bob's one of the best people
you'll ever run across in your entire life.

NADINE
He asked that twirp how much he'd give for me.

RICK ~~
He wasn't going to sell you to that stimg, he
was just trying to teach you a lesson.

NADINE
I'm worth a whole lot more than a pack of
chewing gum, Rick.

RICK
If David had laid a hand on you, he would have
regretted it, I can tell you that. Man do you
know what Bob would do for you, or me or Dianne
or anyone in his crew? He'd literally die for
you, Nadine.

NADINE
I just can't imagine Bob Hughes dying for me,
why is that Rick?

RICK
Maybe you don't believe me, but I know it's
true. Why do you think he always dives, or is
always the first one in with the gun? The only
reason he always tries to act so mean is
because he's so soft that he's afraid you and
everyone else will find out and take advantage
of him. Man I've been hearing about Bob for
years. He's notorious for that one particular
thing, along with a lot more obvious talents.
Don't let him or Dianne get you down. They
mean well.

NADINE
I just hope you're right, baby. I just hope
you'tre right.

Dianne stands up and wrestles Bob.

BOB
What the fuck are you doing? The goddamn bitch
has gone completely crazy. What do you want to
go to bed for? Man, we ought to be out
working.

Dianne begins to undress Bob, and herself.

BOB
I know this hospital on the coast, I just know
is a virgin. I know it is.

DIANNE
You're crazy Bob, you know that? You ain't
fucked me in a month and you're crazier than a
shithouse rat.

BOB
I mean this place has got security zero.

BOB
Hold you? What do you want me to hold you
for? Man we ought to get cracking, get in the
car and see if we can't make it up to that
hospital before it gets daylight out. Boy
you'll love this one, Dianne. I'11 even let
you hacksaw some on the bars.

DIANNE
Oh, boy, you'll let me hacksaw on the bars.
Whoopee. For Christsakes, you mean you're not
even going to let me go inside? I thought you
loved me. You won't fuck me and you won't let
me go inside.

Bob and Dianne begin to mess around.

BOB
Let's go on up the coast right now and just
look over this hospital 1f nothing else. I
mean, you'll just cream your jeans when you see
it. It sits way back in the woods. It's a
giveaway, baby. I can actually see those big
gallon jugs of pills on the shelves. Thousands
of them, baby, thousands of them. Coke by the
twenty ounce jug! Can you imagine twenty
ounces of coke? Did I ever tell you about the
time we got the hospital over east of the
mountains and got the twenty ounce jug of coke?

DIANNE
(repeats Bob's last line along with him)
Only about ten thousand times.

Dianne body freezes a the SOUND of the front door RIPPING
away from its hinges, and crashing to the apartment floor.

FOUR BURLY NARCOTICS DETECTIVES COME galloping across the
downed door like a bunch of mustangs breaking out of a
corral. Guns drawn, faces tight, muscles coiled, they
pair off into two teams, two grab Bob and Dianne, and the
other two knock the door down to Rick and Nadine's

Alright you two, you turn around.
Dianne and Bob comply.

GENTRY
Getting a little droopy there in the tits,
aren't we, Dianne?

By now Dianne is relaxed into it. She looks at her
breasts, smiles and says:

DIANNE
Yeah, it's goddamn Bob's fault. He won't take
them out for exercise anymore.

Gentry smiles.
GENTRY
What's the matter, Bob, you been shooting too
much dope again? Seems like the last time we
were by here and you were hooked to the gills,
Dianne was complaining of the same thing.

BOB
Oh, you know how it is, out on the job all day.
Work, work, work like a dog, man comes home, he
wants to relax a bit

GENTRY
I've been hearing about all that work you've

down a bit. And then Wham-bam, you knock off

Hey, wait a minute, that wasn't me, pal. I
ain't hit no poison shop in years, look at.me.
Do I look like I'm using.

He does.

GENTRY
Looks like you're hooked to the gills.

BOB
You got a warrant, pal?

GENTRY
Yeah, I got a warrant, Bob. We put it ona
micro dot. I got it pasted right on the end of
a thirty eight slug. You want to see it Bob?
I'll shoot it through, if you'll just turn your
eves backwards, you can read it when it passes
Y.

BOB

Wow, man, you guys are heavy, what you been
reading, Mickey Spillane?

GENTRY
You know what they give little punks like you
for holking illegal class A narcotics?

BOB
What can I say? I'm not holding. Let me call
my attorney. I'm sure he can straighten all
this out in a few minutes.

Two other DETECTIVES, Halamer and Trousinski, begin to
trash the apartment. They reach the Golf clubs in the

corner and

Bob shakes

Trousinski

dump them out on the floor.

BOB
Hey Gentry, what are you shooting these days?
I got my handicap down pretty good near eight,
how about that?

his head yes and looks at Gentry.

GENTRY
Eight huh?

BOB
Shot three eagles on the back side alone last
time I played Mayfield.

GENTRY
I don't play those public courses, greaseball,
that course is for pussies, no wonder you have
an eight handicap.

BOB
Hey, how am I supposed to play if my clubs are
all broke?

is now breaking them in half. The sympathy

play is working on Gentry.

GENTRY
Alright, Trousinski, break two more then leave
the clubs alone.

You haven't gone out in the bushes and buried
the drugs again, have you Dianne?

DIANNE
I don't know what you're talking about. Why
don't you just go piss up a rope, fuckwad.

GENTRY
Dianne, what language you use.

Gentry looks to his partner and chuckles.

Bob smiles

GENTRY
I always heard you guys had class.

BOB
I tried to talk to her about her language but
she still talks like a truck driver.

GENTRY
Okay, kiddies, here's how it's coming down.
You can just tell us where it's at and save
yourselves a whole lot of trouble or you can
sit there with your mouths shut while we tear
this apartment apart board by board. Now how's
it going to be?

his "What-can-I-say-it's-out-of-my-hands"

BOB
Tear away. This place is rented and insured
and my lawyer will no doubt file against you,
because, pard, you ain't findin' nothing in
this apartment unless you brought it with you.

Light is streaming in the windows. Huddled in a corner of

and Bob. Some are showing twitchiness of withdrawal.

RICK
You going to sue them, Bob? I'd sue the hell
out of them if it was up to me.

Bob, who's head is buried in his arms that are gathered
around his legs, lifts his head up and yawns.

BOB
No. Sue them? Hell no, I ain't going to sue
them. I told you all this crap was rented and
insured. What do I want to sue them for?

RICK
How about our clothes?

BOB

All right, go call your smart sister.

DIANNE
I'll go make the goddamn call, but you either
got to fuck me when I get back, or you got to
let me go in that hospital pharmacy with you
when we hit it.

BOB
OK, I'm an easy rider.

39 INT. APARTMENT DAY ek

Dianne's smart SISTER looks around the room in amazement.
She touches parts of the wreckage.

SISTER
Good God, what did they use, sledge hammers?

DIANNE
No, fireaxes.

SISTER
Christ I've seen tornadoes down south that
didn't produce this kind of destruction.

.Dianne's sister never really looks Bob in the eye, even
when she is talking to him she is wandering around the
room looking at some of the damage or looking at Dianne.

DIANNE
I was just reading about tornadoes in the
encyclopedia. It's very scientific, I think,
and they were saying that they do a lot of
damage but they rarely hit the inside of an
apartment.

SISTER
By the way Bob, what happened to your prick?
It looks like it's pointing to China
permanently. Have you been doing too much
speed, Bob?

BOB
(laughs it off)

SISTER
Oh boy, Bob, you're really on top of it all
today. Why don't you just leave Dianne, Bob,
40

SISTER
(continued)
and go join one of those female impersonator
clubs. And then no doubt you'd be happy, to
have finally found your place in life,
contributing to a normal segment of our
community.

Bob blows up at her.

BOB
Get her out of here, Dianne, get her out!

And with that Bob hurriedly strides to the bathroom to get
out of range of the barrage of insults he knows are
forthcoming.

SISTER
That's what I always liked about old Bob. He
just won't stand around to lose. He'll run
every time, the yellow-bellied sonofabitch.

She drops the clothing on the littered floor and heads for
the door.

SISTER
Goodbye, Dianne, and be sure to call your other
sister next time. I've done my good deed for
the month.

Dianne looks up from a needle and a spoon she is using to
fix with. Pull back from this image as Dianne feels the
drugs.

DIANNE
Yeah, thanks, smarty, sorry I couldn't be more
sociable, but what can one do when one doesn't
even have a chair to offer?

EXT. APARTMENT DAY (later)

Bob hands Rick the keys to the car. Everyone is dressed
in clothes that don't really fit them, in style at least.
Bob has a duck-hunting jacket on with a duck sewn on to
the back of it, and Dianne is wearing a bowling shirt.
Rick and Nadine are dressed like a very conservative
suburban couple.

Oh, Lord, it's my dope fiend thieving son and
his crazy nymphomaniac wife.

Mom closes the door and...

INT. MOM'S HOUSE_DAY

Bob's Mom makes her way through a cozy house, a bird ina
cage, a television that is on. She stops at a window that
is open and Bob is on the other side of it.

MOM
Please tell me what I did to deserve this.
Never knowing when there's going to be a knock
on the door and someone telling me my baby's
dead. ..

INT./EXT. MOM'S HOUSE_DAY

Mom shuts the window on Bob and Dianne. They make their
way around the house.

OTHER NEIGHBORS are looking on now.
Bob and Dianne meet Mom at the back door.

MOM

pharmacist or run down by a car fleeing from
police pursuit. . . why me?

BOB
Mom, do you by chance still have those clothes
I left here when we got sent to the joint last
time?

MOM
No, I gave all that stuff away years ago. I
thought you were never going to get out.

 

BOB
But Mom, how could you think that. ..

MOM
The first time he got arrested he was a little
boy, I went down to the police department,
along with that horrible Tom the Priest who
turned out to be his pusher, and the cops said
they'd let him go if he'd just tell who the
rest of his pals were. He told me right to my
face, "I can't Mom, them's my friends."

Some friends. They left him. He is a thief

him than I am. He can go to prison. He likes
it there anyway, don't you Robert?

BOB

If you say so, mom.

Mrs Hughes groans in despair as Bob goes inside the house.

INT. ATTIC DAY

Bob finds clothes and a picture of his mom and dad when he
was a kid.

INT/EXT. MOM'S APARTMENT DAY

MOM
I'd ask you to sit down, Dianne, but the last
time I did that you fell asleep and dropped a
burning cigarette on my couch and burned a hole
in it. So if you please, just stand where you
are so I can watch you, and catch you should
you fall asleep standing on your feet. I
wouldn't want you to burn yourself up or fall
down and hurt yourself while you are in my
home, Dianne.

DIANNE
Why do you hate Bob and I so, Mama? We never
done anything to make you hate us so.

MOM
I don't hate you, Dianne, and I don't hate
Robert either. And the good Lord knows that to
be the truth. I truly feel pity for you both.
You're grown up now, and yet you still act as
children who want to do nothing but run and
play. You cannot run and play all of your
life, Dianne.

Bob emerges with a suitcase filled with clothes draped
across his shoulder.

MOM
Is there anything else that belongs to you up
there?

BOB

If there is, give it away. I can always get
some more.

MOM
Oh, to be sure, you'll just go out and steal
some more.

BOB
Well, we gotta go, Mom. See you again soon.
You be good now. And don't do anything I
wouldn't do.

MOM
And what could I possibly do that you are not
capable of, I ask you that?

Bob and Dianne walk to the end of the drive where the cab
is still waiting for them and get in the car, Bob a little
depressed as he leaves his mother crying out her
frustrations to the neighborhood. The neighbors are
listening.

MOM

What sins could I possibly do that you have not
done a thousand times?

EXT, APARTMENT HOUSE #2 DAY

 

Bob and Rick walk up the front path to the house.
BOB

Hey, Rick, nice work. This looks like a
fucking comfortable place.

INT. APARTMENT DAY

 

Rick, Nadine and Bob are in the living room of their new
apartment. Bob is turning on the television which is in
the middle of the room.

NADINE
Do I have to go? You're not going to want a
screamer or a shimmy girl on this one are you?

BOB
I don't know. Why do you ask?

NADINE
They always got those signs around hospitals
that says QUIET, and if I was to go into that
shimmy act, they'd probably throw me into the
psycho ward and I'd never get out.

Bob fools with the television and thinks for a second.

Dianne has

BOB
Yeah, why the hell not. You just go ahead and
stay here, Nadine. Just relax and watch a
little TV. I can just see all those pretty
colored bottles of pills that hospital is
holding for me right now. Hot Dog!

NADINE
(Her eyes light up)
Oh, speaking of dogs, Bob, do you think Rick
and I could get a dog, a little pup or
something to hold and pet when you guys are
gone?

BOB
Nope, no dogs, and that's final.

RICK
What you got against dogs, Bob?

BOB
No fucking dogs!

DIANNE

Bob.

Bob stops tuning the TV and sits down trying to forget the

others are

during a raid on a drugstore in the city, and
little Panda got out of the car and ran away.

VIEW of Dianne and Bob yelling for the dog.
DIANNE'S VOICE
We looked for him, but there was just no time.

We had the heat on us and we had to get out of
there.

A POLICE CAR CRUISES BY Bob hiding on the other side of
his car.

Bob switches to another show and sits down to watch.

BOB
Dog may be man's best friend but he really
screwed me around I'll tell you that.

On the TV, there is another show with a dog in it. And
Bob gets right up and turns the TV off, losing his temper.

BOB
(shouting)
It's off, we ain't going to the coast, we ain't
going nowhere! Do you know what you have just
done to us, Nadine, just by even mentioning
dogs in our home?

NADINE
No, I don't Bob, what did I do?

BOB
You just put a thirty-day hex on us, that's
what. Right now our luck just flew out the
window for thirty days. Have we got a
calendar, so we'll know when the hex ends?
What month is it anyway?

RICK
Jesus, Bob, nobody told us about not saying
anything about dogs. How was we supposed to
know?

Bob pulls himself up into his most put-upon, abused manner
and answers.

BOB
You know why no one mentioned dogs? I'11 tell
you why, because just to have mentioned them
would have been a hex in itself.

RICK
(sarcastically)
Well, now that we're on the subject, is there
any other sacred subjects or things we're not
supposed to do that will affect our future?

BOB
As a matter of fact there are a few, and we
might as well discuss them right now, being as
how we are shut down for thirty days anyway.
HATS. If I ever see a hat laying on a
bed...you'll never see me again.

DIANNE
That's a laugh.
Pause..

910 -88
32

NADINE
Why a hat?

BOB
Because that's just the way it is, sweetie!

BOB
And mirrors. Don't ever look at the back side
of a mirror, because when you do you'll affect
your future because you're looking at yourself
backwards. Actually, you are looking at your
innerself and you don’t recognize it because
you've never seen that side of yourself before.

{Bob is getting confused at his own
explanation)

But anyway, you can freeze into motion your
future that way and it can be either good or

bad, in any case, we just don't want to take
chances.

Bob breathes for a second.

BOB
And there's cats. A lot of people are
frightened of just black cats. As far as I'm
concerned they're all bad. Have you ever
noticed how they look at you sometimes, like
they're superior to you? Well, that's because
they are. They can readjust your future,
especially if you sit on one, or in any way
piss one off. So I just stay clear of the
whole mess of them.

Bob stops for a second again.

BOB
The main thing is just remember the hats. A
goddamn hat is the king of them all. It's
worth at least fifteen years bad luck or even
death. I'd rather have death myself, because I
just couldn't stand no fifteen year hex.

Rick and Nadine remain silent mulling over Bob's latest
erratic behavior. Dianne is shaking her head yes, and
wholly agreeing with Bob's philosophy.

DIANNE
Relax, Bob, let's go lay down for awhile.
You've been on the go for days. This thirty
days ain't going to kill us now.

INT. BEDROOM NIGHT ae

 

Dianne snuggles up next to Bob in bed. Bob has a golf
club and mistakenly hits a bedroom lamp.

DIANNE
Don't let it get you down, Bob. Sometimes bad
luck can be good luck. I mean look at all the
times we either had a flat or engine trouble

and made it to your score late, thinking it was
good luck, you know what I mean?

BOB
Hell, I can't even figure it all out myself. I
just know from years of experience the things
to dodge and the signs to look for, like, it is
as if whoever manages such things is telling
you, "Get out of there and get it, kid, it's
there for the taking and everything's free this
week. I'll let you know when your time is up.
You'll see the signs. All you have to do is
look for the signs."

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD NIGHT

Overhead view of small dog under porch light.

EXT. APARTMENT NIGHT

 

A small dog BARKS in the distance, a street light glistens
off the dew on lawns of houses surrounding Bob's
apartment. A dated model pickup with cab-over camper is
parked across from the apartment.

INT. CAMPER NIGHT

 

Gentry draws back from field glasses that he is peering
through. HALAMER, another detective speaks up.

HALAMER
Why don't we just go on up, plant some stuff on
them and drag them on in? That usually works.

Gentry blinks a couple of times to clear his vision and
assumes a superior pose.

GENTRY
I'll tell you why, I don't want to get Hughes
on no chickenshit possession beef, and that's
all you're going to get him on unless you catch
him cold on his way home from a score.

GENTRY

(continued)

({Halamer nods)
Bob isn't really all that bad a guy. He does
have a little class and I got to respect him,
as much as I hate the sonofabitch. He runs in
spurts while he follows his luck and when he's
hot he runs like a dog and when he's cold he'll
just lay up in some rat hole some Place and
you'll never see hide nor hair of him.

HALAMER
Yeah, you know this guy better than I do.

GENTRY
I've been chasing Bob since he was a kid and
hell, he was a pro back then. I think they got
him on his first pharmacy when he was thirteen
years old. He knows what it's all about,
believe me. He can actually smell heat. He
probably knows we're sitting out here right
now. But if he moves again, we'll be right on
his case.

Halamer takes a sip of coffee.

HALAMER
What are we going to do in the meantime, just
sit out here and freeze our fucking nuts off?

INT. APARTMENT NIGHT

 

A KNOCK comes on the front door of Bob's apartment. The
light flashes on and Bob is there quickly with his gun,
and Rick is ready to back him up.

He opens the peephole and looks out.

VIEW through the peephole, a little OLD LADY is standing
outside in a bathrobe.

BOB'S EXPRESSION of confusion. He let's Rick take a look
through the door.

Bob keeps opening the door further, then looks from side
to side for somebody hiding beside the little old lady.

LADY
---and I been here for twenty years now. I'm
sorry to bother you young folks like this, did
I wake you up?

BOB
No, we was still up.

LADY
Well, I don't know what to think, but I was
Just getting ready to go to bed and I saw this
sinister looking man with a ladder creeping
around in the bushes outside. I wonder if you
would be so kind as to go out there and look
around and see if he's gone. I'm afraid I just
couldn't sleep with one of those crazy sex
maniacs running loose in the neighborhood.

Bob hides a laugh. Rick snickers, but then catches his
expression and realizes the possible graveness of the
situation.

BOB
I assure you, ma'am, that I will take a look
promptly.

LADY

Well, thank you very much. Goodnight.

They shut the door.

INT. APARTMENT NIGHT

Bob sits on the sofa and thinks. Nadine bites a hangnail
and leans against a wall heater.

Rick flexes his muscles for Nadine.

DIANNE scratches her head and watches Bob, who is still
thinking on the couch. Bob suddenly jumps up.

BOB
Well, they must have followed us when we moved,
so I guess we'll just have to teach thema
little lesson.

outside his house and drives off.

INT. APARTMENT DAY xe

Bob is writing a letter to the narcotics division in
printed block letters. Rick looks on. Bob reads the
letter outloud as he writes.

BOB
The reason you can never get Bob Hughes for
possession of narcotics is that he has an

north side of him. They have a fishing line
running between their houses and Bob signals
the guy...

positive of.....it's not his goddamn lunch.

52B EXT. GUS'S HOUSE DAY *e

BOB
Say, did you see that fella creeping around
your house last night with that ladder?

Gus stares at Bob, alarm spreading across his features.

BOB
Yeah, well I never would have seen the guy
neither but about two o'clock this morning I
look out the window and sure enough, there the
guy is. A big ugly sonofabitch wearing a long
dark trenchcoat and he's standing up on top of
his ladder and he's looking in your upstairs
windows.

Gus looks up at his window, growing very angry and
grumbling and looks like he is about to hit Bob.

Gus
I'll shoot the sonofabitch. I'11 shoot the
sonofabitch right in the balls.

Bob backs up a bit. This is going to go better than he
planned.

Wait a minute, hold on a second mister. I

Watch me, just watch me.

I shouldn't have even told you about the guy.
In fact, I think I ought to go right now and
call the police.

GUS
Listen, you little scrawny sonofabitch, I can
handle this myself. If you tell one other
person about this I'll ring your neck.

Are you threatening me?

No, idiot. I'm promising you.

some place to go.

sonofabitch with anything. He's always got the
neighbors holding it for him.

Bob peeks out the curtained front window of the apartment

funny dance to himself.

Bob breaks into another laughing fit.

Nadine gets upset and gets out of her chair and goes to
the bedroom.

Halamer and Trousinski (also known as the Strangler)
tip-toeing across the lawn quietly. They peer up at the
curtained window in Bob's house.

VIEW of Bob's window, and then of the uncurtained one next
door.

Halamer and Trousinski whisper, but we cannot hear them.
Carefully they raise a ladder they are carrying and lean

it against the side of Gus' house. This causes a muffled
THUMP.

Gus hears the thump outside and starts down the stairs to
see what the sound is.

Bob and the crew watch the action outside.
WHAM!

The blast catches Halamer in the rump and he screams while
he gropes for his gun.

INT. APARTMENT NIGHT

Among Dianne's "Good Lord" and Nadine's “What the heck is
going on out there?" we can hear Bob's laugh, above the
blasts and confusion. Bob steps behind the curtains.

BOB
Those cops are gonna be pretty mad now. Let's
get the fuck outa here. Tomorrow morning,
Rick, you take Nadine and get the car ready,
get the thing tuned up and Dianne, get the
necessary supplies to make our move. We
haven't been cross roading in years.

Bob sneaks out the front door of his apartment, gets about
halfway down the hallway and is suddenly grabbed from
behind and punched, and is SURROUNDED by three PLAIN
CLOTHES COPS, one of them is Gentry.
9-10-68

Bob is on the ground looking up at them.

GENTRY
Bob, I want to talk about what happened last
night.

BOB

We told the investigating officers all we knew
about that and we haven't got anything further
to add.

GENTRY
You little punk. Halamer and Trousinski know
how you set them up, Bob, and I can honestly
say that they are anything but happy about the
matter. It took hours for us to pull all that
buckshot out of him. Why don't you just go out
along the highways and byways of this great
grand country of ours until you find a nice
spot to settle down somewhere far away from
here. A place where narcotics drawers are just
brimming to the top with all kinds of goodies
laying there waiting for you to take them?
How's that sound Bob?

BOB
Fuck you Gentry. I won the goddamn war, not
you. Who are you to dictate the terms?

Bob jumps up and tries to get in a punch, but the officers
deck him and he is on the ground again.

BOB
Why don't you find you a small town police
department where you can just step in as chief
where all you've got to worry about is the
usual Saturday night drunks and the kids on
Halloween?

GENTRY
So you think you won the war, huh? When
Halamer and Trousinski get a hold of you, hell,
4t will all be over in a month's time. Oh,
yes, we might have to explain it away for a few
days, but sooner or later everyone's going to
forget that you ever existed. That is, all but
the pharmacists. They'll probably hold an
annual ball on the eve of your death for the
next twenty years.

Then Nadine walks around the corner. Gentry and the
others help him up.
9-10 -88

ce GENTRY
Let me help you up, Bob.

The police leave Bob.

BOB
Fuck you Gentry, fuck you. I just wish that it
had been you out there that caught some of the
buckshot.

Gentry is already halfway down the hall by the time we see
him again.

Nadine reaches Bob, who has blood on his mouth and shirt.

NADINE
How come you always talk so nasty to those
cops? Why don't you talk nice?

BOB
Shit! Who ever heard of talking nice toa
cop? That crap went out with the forties. I
tried talking to a cop nice and respectful once
and you know what he did?

NADINE
ce What?

BOB
He kicked me in the kneecap, that's what the
bastard did.

NADINE
Well, what did they do when you talked nasty to
them?

BOB

They kicked me in the kneecap then too, but at
least I'm expecting it.

Close view of Bob

BOB
Oh, we're going to leave town all right, but
don't think any chickenshit cops is running us
out of town, because they ain't. It's only
because I think it's the smart thing to do.

thighs, wetting her lips, trembling occasionally, and
sighing often as if it is the only way she can keep
breathing, while she watches Bob pace back and forth.

BOB
OWL PHARMACY, Prescription services, Convenient
downtown location!

Bob rips that page out of the phone book. He puts the
book down and reads off some more pharmacies.

Nadine looks depressed. She tugs a hangnail on her finger
and thinks REAL HARD about something.

BOB

Okay! Let's get off our duffs and out on the
road. We ain't going to find no morphine
hanging off the fir trees. Dianne, you pick
out some doctors and try putting the old
headache act on them. Rick and Nadine, you
come along with me. We got to find out just
what poison shops in this town are holding.

Dianne waiting in the waiting area of the Doctor's

blind person.

RECEPTIONIST
Is this your first appointment with Doctor

Say, I've got a one milligram dilaudid
prescription and I've been all over town trying
to find me some. Could you possibly £111 this
prescription for me?

INT. PHARMACY DAY

 

Nadine watches the pharmacist through a mirror she is
using to try on sample lipstick.

The pharmacist changes from a smiling good natured type to
a frowning, snarling, no-nonsense masher.

PHARMACIST
No, we don't have any dilaudid in any form. We
haven't carried any form of that crap in years.
So don't bug us anymore.

He slams down the phone and looks around his store, an
inquisitive CLERK steps closer to the pharmacist.

CLERK
What was that all about?

PHARMACIST
Oh, one of those goddamn dope fiends again,
asking if we stock one-milligram dilaudid.

CLERK
We don't have any, do we?

PHARMACIST
No, I don't stock the stuff anymore. I used
to, but those crazy dope fiends about drove me
out of my mind over them...

Nadine begins to get a creepy feeling and leaves slowly.

PHARMACIST
«.-all day long they were pestering me with
phony prescriptions, at night, they crashed
through the front door, the back door, through
the roof, I expected to find one come crawling
down the chimney.

Rick and Nadine saunter out the door. The Pharmacist lets
out a sigh of relief.
9-10-88

PHARMACIST

That was a couple of them right there, I'd bet
my bottom dollar on it. Did you see how they
stood around trying to look so innocent and
prim? They run in packs just like wolves. If
you let them think you've got a narcotic drug
left on the shelf, they'll pester you until
they get it. There isn't anything you can do
once they find out you've got what they're
after.

102 INT. EXAMINATION ROOM DAY

 

The smiling, middle aged, good natured DOCTOR enters and
Dianne is on the table wearing the white nightgown.

DOCTOR
And how are you today?

DIANNE
Not too damned good, Doc.

DOCTOR
This is your first visit with us, isn't it?

He studies her personal history card in his hand.

Dianne puts on her most pained expression, blocks her eyes
from the overhead light.

DOCTOR
What seems to be the problem?

DIANNE
I have a horrible migrane. Can we turn out the
lights, I mean, they're just killing me.

DOCTOR
I'm sorry, this is a skylight.

DIANNE
I'm feeling like I'm sick to my stomach. I've
taken things for this in the past. Not codeine
because I'm allergic to that, but something
else.

DOCTOR
I see.

DIANNE
But there's this little blue pill, I think it
starts with a "d" dilly-something.

both shaking their heads.

BOB
Don't look so glum. The bastard's holding all
right.

NADINE
I don't know, Bob, the clerk asked the
pharmacist what it was all about, and he said,
"Hell, I haven't seen any dilaudid in years."

BOB
Oh yeah, well they were just putting the shuck
on you, because I know the bastards had
dilaudid in there not too awful long ago, and
besides, they wouldn't have gotten so paranoid
if they wasn't holding.

Bob checks another pharmacy on the yellow pages list.

EXT. OK USED CARS DAY ee

 

Bob is signing a paper on the hood of a red pickup truck.

BOB
Now the reason that we have this truck is not
because we necessarily need another vehicle.

INT. RED PICKUP NIGHT

But we can move easier, in this sort of a

you go back to the pickup and get that small
bar I shoved under the front seat.

Bob and Nadine walk away arm in arm. Bob flirting with
Nadine.

Bob
Nadine and I will walk around a bit and see
what all is happening on this street. See if
there's any drunks or couples sitting around in
any of these cars parked along here.

Rick fetching the bar from the front seat of the truck and
walking back Bob's direction.

EXT. STREET NIGHT ~

 

Rick meets up with Bob and Nadine.

BOB
Okay, Rick here's the play. We get the traffic
right first, then we move over in front of
those open transoms. You cup your hands, I
stick my foot in, you lift, up I go.

Rick nods.
BOB

I'll let you in the back door and we can amble
over to the truck, in back of the Pharmacy.

Bob and Rick move fast, step up under the pharmacy's
entrance and Rick lifts while Bob pulls, up and over.

Bob is in an area that is divided by rough-cut dirty, aged
wood. Two safes are against one wall. Also there is an
alley entrance which has a huge sliding wooden door,
secured by a padlock, Bob tears off the padlock to ensure
a quick exit.

NEXT, in the other section of the room, encased in
aluminum and glass, 1s the back of the pharmacy, Bob
ATTACKS a small sliding door and enters, moving quickly
along the shelves of pills and halfway along the main
counter he finds a locked drawer. It isn't too large
but...

WHEN HE SPRINGS IT OPEN he finds it heaped to the brim
with different bottles of different colors and designs,
and all of them have a purple federal stamp on the cap.

BOB GRINS.

He grabs the whole drawer and runs for the alley exit.

while she opens the door of the truck.

Nadine then grabs the drawer, swings it backward as far as
her arms can go and brings the drawer forward as if she is
a fish wife emptying a pan of water, spilling the bottles
all over the seat and floor of the truck.

Bob can't believe what he's seeing.

INT. PHARMACY NIGHT
Rick and the safes.

BOB'S VOICE
Rick, forget about the safes.

EXT. PHARMACY BACK DOOR NIGHT
Rick emerges from the pharmacy. They close the back door

and both take off running toward Nadine and the pickup.

EXT. TRUCK NIGHT

 

Nadine bends down with the empty drawer between her legs
then straightens up, flipping the drawer up and over her
head. It sails into the air...

SPINS AROUND a few times and lands in the street a few
parking meters away.

A small grey VOLKSWAGEN rounds a corner and slows down
near the drawer, seemingly studying it momentarily, then
it drives on.

ANOTHER CAR is coming as Bob and Rick reach shaking
Nadine.

BOB
Okay. Let's get all these bottles together,
put them in a sack and you, Nadine, you take
that sack and walk over to those bushes along
side that house and wait for us while we go
back and get that drawer and clean it up. You
didn't have any gloves on and, baby, that clean
cream drawer is going to have nothing but your
fingerprints all over it.

It takes a second to get all the bottles together.

INT. TRUCK NIGHT (later)

 

The truck is moving. Bob and Rick breathe a sigh of
relief as the headlights of the truck spotlight the drawer
in front of them.

Rick jumps out of the truck and picks up the drawer and
gets back in the truck.

INT. MOTEL NIGHT

 

Bob and Rick and Nadine have entered, Dianne comes into
the room to see what they found, but Nadine doesn't stay,
she marches back to her room and slams the door shut.

Bob is inspecting the bottles in the bag and bringing them
out one by one.

DIANNE

You been making a pass at her again, Bob?

Bob shakes his head and paws through the pile of small
bottles.

He comes up with a small one with a blue label.

BOB
I'll be goddamned.

DIANNE
What is it, Bob? What did you find?

BOB
Powdered dilaudid, that's what. A whole
untouched one eighth ounce bottle of powdered
D. And there should be another partially
filled bottle here somewhere.

Bob spreads them all out on the coffee table and separates
them into different categories.

BOB
You know what this bottle is worth, Rick?

He holds up the bottle that is only two inches high.
Rick shakes his head as he takes the bottle from Bob.

BOB
Well, I'll tell you what it's worth. It's
worth a goddamn fortune, at least a small
fortune. That there's got eight hundred and
forty some odd sixteenths in it, and at ten
dollars a sixteenth, that comes to around eight
thousand four hundred dollars worth of the best
goddamn dope money can buy.

Slaps his leg.

DIANNE
Hot dog, what a find, yep, that there little
bottle will probably last us three for a week.
I guess we must have outrun that hex we had on
us. I sure an glad we started cross-roading,
aren't you, Bob?

And Bob takes a willing Dianne in his arms and whirls her
around the room, as she squeals and shrieks in delight.

Bob jumps up. Rick is fixing.

BOB
Okay, pards, I'l] show you how we'll hide this

You cross over a couple of these units and
stash the stuff over somebody else's room.

INT. BEDROOM NIGHT

 

Rick enters the room and stands awhile just inside the
door watching Nadine. She is still on the bed with her
coat on and her head lowered.

RICK
Buck up, baby. So you muffed it, everyone does
that once in awhile. It came out all right and
that's what counts. We're going to go out
again, but don't worry, we'll be back soon.

Nadine raises a tear stained face.

NADINE
What did that sonofabitch say about me?

RICK
Baby, he didn't say anything. Not one word.
Dianne doesn't even know anything about it.

NADINE
But he isn't going to take me along anymore.
Is that it? And one day you all will just drop
me off on a corner and tell me to do such such
and I'll come back and wait and wait and you'll
never show up.

THEN her voice breaks into sobs and the trail of tears
become a flood.

Rick kneels beside her.

RICK
Baby, we ain't going to leave you standing on
no corner. We ain't leaving you any place.
You're mine, baby. I'm not leaving you. Bob
is no doubt leaving you home tonight because
you are feeling bad. He knows how bad you feel
about the whole thing.

NADINE
To hell with that sonofabitch and his hexes and
all his funny little stunts. It wasn't my
fault he had to leave the coast. That was his
fault. The goddamn hog.

RICK
Now, baby, you just take it easy, we got us a
good thing going. Why break it up? Tomorrow
you will see things in a different light.
You're all upset. It'll be fine.

NADINE
No Rick, it's not going to be fine. I just
can't stand their superior ways and all that
crap about hexes. You don't believe that
stuff, do you?

RICK

Hell, I don't know, Nadine. What difference
does it make? It's their thing. I guess if
they want to believe in hexes, they're entitled
to. All we got to watch is not talking about
pets in their presence and not leaving any hats
on any bed. Hell there's nothing hard about
that.

NADINE
Well, I'm just going to prove to all of you
that there isn't anything to any of that stuff.

Nadine marches to the closet and promptly takes out one of
her hats. She determinedly flips it onto the bed and then
asks Rick:

NADINE
Do you think it will make any difference that
I'm using a woman's hat instead of a man's?

Rick shakes his head slowly.

RICK
I wish you hadn't of done that, Nadine. It
really isn't fair. I mean, you can do whatever
you want to change our lives, but what do you
want to mess with someone else's for? That
don't seem quite right.

Rick shakes his head again. He lays an outfit anda
couple of sixteenth down on the night stand.

RICK

I think they want to go right away. We won't
be long, maybe a couple of hours.

EXT. PARKING LOT NIGHT

 

Rick breaks into a car in the hospital parking lot.
Bob and Dianne kiss before he takes off.

Dianne watches from her stolen car as Rick, in his car
heads right between two parked police cars ata
hair-raising thirty-five miles an hour. Only three feet
separates the two cars, so Rick gets both of their rear
fenders in the initial rush.

INT. HOSPITAL NIGHT

 

Inside the HOSPITAL it is like one continuous corridor,
broken up at intervals by little substations, which are
composed of a waist high counter enclosing a switchboard,
a few desks and an aid station of sorts. There are a
couple of NURSES hanging around the substations. A
POLICEMAN is in the corridor.

OUTSIDE we can hear the sound of cars revving their
engines, and horns BLARING and metal SMASHING.

The policeman and the nurses go to the front windows of
the corridor to see what the problem is.

THEIR VIEW from through the window of the parking lot.
TWO CARS are running amok in the lot.

EXT. PARKING LOT NIGHT

 

Then he throws the car in reverse, and floorboards the
accelerator.

His car clings to the smashed police cars for a second
while his tires scream and pour out smoke. then abruptly,
the torn and intermeshed metal of the cars separates and
away Rick roars again until he comes to a halt forty feet
away against another late model car.

VIEW of the Hospital, people are hanging out the windows
watching.

Rick keeps right on working, he gives the police another
shot for good measure, then he picks out an automobile
behind and off to one side and gives it a bank shot that
crumples the right front fender.

TWO POLICEMEN come running from the front doors of the
hospital.

They run across the front lawn less than a hundred yards
away from Rick.

Then Dianne gets into the act. She holds her horn down
causing one continuous blast, and squeals out of her
position toward the officers, who are running after Rick.

VIEW of Dianne closing in on the officers, who take a dive
to the ground.

Dianne keeps going until she comes to Rick, who has
ditched his car and is now on foot. She stops
momentarily to let Rick in, then turns and takes off
burning rubber all the way out of the parking lot.

BOB SEES and HEARS the pandemonium from where he is hiding
up against the side of the building.

BOB
They'll probably talk about this one for years.

He smiles and quickly smashes out a window and climbs into
a vacant office.

INT. HOSPITAL NIGHT

Bob coming through the window of a darkened office. He
crosses the room, sticks his head out the door into a long
corridor, and:

INT. CORRIDOR NIGHT

NOT SEEING ANYBODY, steps across the corridor to the
locked entrance of the PHARMACY. After studying the door
momentarily, he takes a small pry bar, slams the tapered
end into the crack between the door and the jam at lock
level, and SNAPS the other end of the bar back. The door
shoots open with a noise resembling a muffled shot.

INT. PHARMACY NIGHT

Bob: quickly enters and braces the door behind him. It
stays in position, but with a piece of the jam gone, then
136

he goes directly to the narcotics cabinets housed behind a
counter. The lockers are made of one-eighth inch sheet
steel and have large brass padlocks on them.

Bob tries to wedge his pry bar between the bolt of a lock
but the bar is too big. Next he tries to wedge it between
the lock and the hasp, but the bar slips out.

BOB
Fuck it!

The sweat is pouring down Bob's face in rivulets, his
clothes are damp and his hands are beginning to shake.

He tries forcing the bar into the crack beside the cabinet
door, but the bar jumps toward him every time he applies
pressure.

He tries lifting the cabinet free from the wall, but it is
solid. He jams the pry bar between the wall and the
cabinet and gives a mighty heave. The cabinet bends
toward him, but it's obvious that this will take too long.

Bob stands back from the cabinets and brings the wedge
shaped point of the bar down in a cutting motion in an
attempt to tear a hole in the sheet metal and more or less
can-open the thing enough to reach inside.

INT. CORRIDOR NIGHT

INT. CORRIOUR Rives

A nurse hears the noise as she passes by.

She tries to open the door but it is jammed. She pulls
her ear to the door and listens, then she runs down the
hall for help.

INT. PHARMACY NIGHT

Bob has one of the cabinets open only to find Demerol
(otherwise known to drug addicts as "dummy 0i1")

BOB
ugh!

He raises his pry-bar to go for another cabinet when the
door of the pharmacy breaks open behind the weight of .TWO
BURLY ATTENDANTS.

They hurl themselves into the room, take one look at Bob
and immediately begin closing in.

Bob swings his bar at them, and leaps over to a window
overlooking one of the quaint little gardens in the
hospital courtyard. With one swing of the bar, he smashes
out the window and dives through it.

EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD NIGHT

Bob lands on the sidewalk in a roll and when he scrambles
to his feet, blood is streaming down his face.

Above him the attendant is trying to climb out the window.
Bob gives him a mild bop on the head with his bar and the
attendant starts climbing back in. Bob heads for an exit
door to another wing.

The exit door is locked. Bob smashes a hole through the
glass top of the door, reaches in to open it from the
inside, and heads down the corridor.

INT. CORRIDOR NIGHT

He tries wiping blood from his face as he makes his way
down the corridor.

He disappears into a women's restroom.

INT. RESTROOM NIGHT

Bob stands in front of a mirror and examines the damage to
his head.

He watches the blood pump out in small but steady streams.
He washes off his face and hands, and puts paper towels to

the wound. He wipes up the sink and the mirror and then
retreats to a toilet booth.

INT. TOILET NIGHT

Bob sits down and waits.

Rick steps over to the closet. Then he sees something.

NADINE'S FEET are sticking out from the floor on the other
side of the bed.

Her lips and face are a funny bluish color. An outfit
hangs out of a ditch in her arm.

RICK
Oh, my God!

He falls to his knees to hold her.
RICK
I'm sorry, baby. I never should have gotten
you into all this.
Rick holds her and moans.

RICK
Oh, baby, please, baby, what can I do?

Dianne enters and sees the situation. She huddles over
Rick, just as:

She bit it.
RICK

She said it was bullshit! Oh, it's all my

Who gave her the stuff, she couldn't have done
that on no two-sixteenths. What's she been

Bob picks up a bottle beside the bed, the small blue
partially filled one.

Bob shakes

Rick takes

BOB
Where in the hell did she get this?

RICK
What is it?

I knew there should have been another opened

You can't call her that. She's dead. Don't

Bob kicks the hat off the bed and backs out of the room

Dianne is clinging to Bob's arm. Bob slams the door.

INT. MOTEL ROOM HALL DAY

DIANNE
How did you ever get away?

BOB
I hid in a woman's restroom. When I woke up
and left, I ran into a nurse and gave her a
story that I was looking for the emergency
room. They fixed me up pretty good.

INT. BOB AND DIANNE'S BEDROOM DAY

Bob and Dianne are looking up at the celling, lying in
bed. :

DIANNE
I know what. Let's pull her up into the attic
and hide her there for the day. At least then
the maid won't be stumbling over her.

BOB
You know what, Dianne? That's probably the
best idea you've come up with in years.

INT. RICK AND NADINE'S BEDROOM DAY

Bob and Dianne enter. Rick is kneeling on the floor with
his head down on the bed as though he is in prayer. Bob
walks up to him cautiously, takes him by the shoulders and
stands him up and hugs him, then walks him out of the
room.

BOB
We got to get Rick here in bed. He's been up
all night and probably don't know what the hell

Dianne replaces the chair where it usually is.

BOB
Hell, it's like trying to raise a couple of
goddamn kids when you take on a couple like
that and try and teach them to steal. Do you
know that, Dianne? It's just like raising
children. All the hassles, all the petty
Jealousies, all the what-ifs.

DIANNE
You aren't kidding.

BOB
I'm getting too old for this shit. These
goddamn kids today, they ain't got no sense at
all. They're all TV babies. They been
watching people killing and fucking each other
on that goddamn boob tube and that's all they
know. Hell, they think it's legal, that it's
the right thing to do.

Bob slowly opens the door.

A uniformed MOTEL MANAGER is outside.

Bob closes

MANAGER
Hello, are you Mr. Hughes?
BOB
Yes.
MANAGER
Are you planning on checking out today?
BOB
No, why?
MANAGER

Well, I'm sorry, sir, but when you registered,
we asked you how long you intended to stay and
you said a couple of days. We had prior
commitments in the form of a reservation for
your room today.

BOB
You mean I got to move out right now?

MANAGER
Well, you see, I'm afraid so.

BOB
Well you just listen here. One of our
colleagues is very sick and I just don't feel
that we want to up and try to move to another
motel...

MANAGER
Well, you see, they're having a sheriff's
convention here in town and all these rooms
have been reserved for them as long as ninety
days ago.

Let me come down to the office in a minute.
I'll be right down.

Or better yet, an undertaker's.

EXT. MOTEL DAY

Bob walks into the office.

INT. MOTEL OFFICE DAY

The stately smiling MANAGER is behind the counter. Bob
is standing in front of her.

MANAGER
I'm sorry Mr. Hughes, you should have let us
know you intended staying this long. We'd
have warned you of our commitments.

BOB
I got a colleague in that motel room that's
got the mumps, I'm scared to move him. What
if they should spread. Hell, we'd hit you
with a law suit that would ruin you. Now
can't you juggle those rooms around a bit or
get the intendeds a reservation somewhere
else?

MANAGER
Well, if that's the case, you go on back to
your room.
(a beat)
Perhaps we can reserve them a room somewhere
else just for this one night. You will have
to leave tomorrow.

Bob walks out of the office. Just as a SHERIFF walks in.

EXT. MOTEL DAY

Bob walking back to his room. POLICE SHERIFFS are
beginning to pull into the motel parking lot. Other

the sofa.

DIANNE
Well?

BOB
It looks like a fucking sheriffs convention
out there. but they're going to let us keep
the room one more night.

DIANNE
Good God, how are we ever going to get her out
of here with the place full of drunken cops
coming and going all night?

BOB
I don't know.

DIANNE
Maybe we could just head on out and leave her
up there.

_ BOB
(astounded)
Are you mad, Dianne? She'd be oozing down out
of the attic in less than a week. These
people around here have seen her. They're
going to remember that she was with us. No we
got to get her out tonight.

INT. MOTEL DAY (later)

 

Bob and Dianne sitting across from each other. Bob is
showing signs of wear.

DIANNE
It's gonna be one heck of a time getting her
outta that crawlspace...
Bob just looks at the floor, doesn't say a word.
DIANNE
Don't know if I'm ever going to get my nails
done now...

Dianne watches Bob watching the floor.

DIANNE
Nadine really got to you didn't she, Bob?

Bob considers the question for awhile, then looks
straight at Dianne for the first time that afternoon.

BOB
Yeah, I suppose you could say that. I'm not
exactly thrilled over her having left us in
such an abrupt manner.

DIANNE
I don't mean that, Bob. I've seen you around
other overdose cases and you never got like
this.

BOB
Like what?

DIANNE
Oh, I don't know, just different.

BOB

Oh, yeah, well 1'11 tell you what's wrong.
I'm scared to fucking death that some big
fucking cop is going to come rumbling through
that door any minute and say, "Out this is my
fucking room, out."

Nadine's HORRIBLE EXPRESSION of fear and happiness
strikes Bob as he begins to handle the body.

The body is very stiff, and like a mannequin. They have
to lower Nadine head first down the hole.

INT. HALLWAY NIGHT

Dianne is ready to catch Nadine who is coming down head
first, but Dianne buckles under the weight of Nadine and
falls with her into the closet with a crash.

INT, MOTEL EARLY MORNING
Bob zips Nadine into garment bag.

Bob parts the curtains of the front window of the motel
room.

OUTSIDE it is a sea of COP CARS. It looks like his car
and the pickup are the only ones that don't have radio
antennas and red lights sticking out all over them.

BOB
(to Dianne)
You go first, unlock the car. Look around a
bit while you're doing it. See if anyone is
lurking about.

Dianne puts her coat on, smiles, turns to the door and
heads for the parking lot.

Bob stands and fidgets in front of the curtains, not
watching Dianne in the parking lot. He can hear the
trunk of the car open. Then a few seconds later Dianne
returns.

DIANNE

We're all set, the car door's open and I
didn't see anyone at all.

EXT. PARKING LOT DAY

 

Bob crosses the parking lot with Nadine over his
shoulder, making it seem like she doesn't weigh a thing.
He puts Nadine in the trunk and returns to the room. In
front of their room is a suspicious cop. Bob ad libs.

BOB
Did you remember the diapers, hon?

INT. ROOM DAY

 

Bob enters, a little winded.

BOB
Wow, what a drag. I mean, that broad was
heavy. You're right, she would have been fat
in a couple of years. Jesus, I'm glad she
decided to go and do her thing now instead of
waiting until then. I'd of never made it.

Bob looks at Dianne and tried to grin but it didn't come
out quite right. He looked like a little kid about to
bawl.
9-10-88
73

BOB
How about going up in the attic and getting
out our stuff and dividing it up. We'll give
Rick the car and the stuff we sent ahead to
those bus depots. Figure it all out. Don't
count him short. Give him the big end.

Dianne stared at Bob until he turned away.

DIANNE
What are you thinking about doing, Bob? What
you got on your mind?

Bob let his eyes slide around the room evasively, he

started to

Bob slowly

speak a couple of times then said nothing.

BOB
The thing is I've been thinking about heading
on back to the coast. I think maybe I'll go
on down and get on that twenty-one day
methadone withdrawal program, get my head
together.

DIANNE
Are you kidding?

BOB
No I'm not, Dianne. I can't do it anymore.

shakes his head no.
DIANNE

Well, I'm not going on no withdrawal program,
so what's going to happen to me?

BOB
Why can't you come along?
DIANNE
No way.
BOB
Why not?
DIANNE

I don't want to. You know I've tried that and
it doesn't work for me.

Dianne is acting like she doesn't know whether to believe

her man or not, knowing that this is the end of their
relationship if Bob goes.

EXT. COUNTRY GRAVEL ROAD DAY

 

The car pulls over to the side of a long road. A heavily
wooded area {s to one side. The pickup truck pulls up
behind the car.

INT. TRUCK DAY

Bob thinks for a second, then speaks just as he gets out
of the truck.

BOB
Get the shovel, Dianne. I'11l handle her.

EXT. ROAD DAY
Bob skips up to the side of the car, Rick is driving.

BOB
You, Rick, stay here and see that nobody comes
along and wants to know if we're having a
picnic or something.

EXT. WOODS DAY

Bob is carrying Nadine through the woods. Dianne is
following. At one point he stops carrying her on his
shoulder, puts her down and drags her while she is still
in the clothing bag.

EXT. WOODS DAY

Bob is digging a hole, he keeps chopping and hammering at
roots that are too stubborn to be dug up. Dianne walks
away.

Bob unzips the bag and takes a look at Nadine before he
covers her up. He remarks at two leaves that are
covering her eyes.

BOB
Well, Nadine, it's every man and woman for his
or her self. And it's time for your old
friend Bob to take off. Maybe I'm changing in
my Autumn years. ‘Cause I don't want to
happen to me what's happened to you.

Bob looks back to Dianne and Rick then back at Nadine.
BOB
And Dianne, I don't think that she can put up

with the straight life. So I guess I'm going
alone.

EXT. WOODS DAY

 

Bob is finishing the job, then he randomly walks around
breaking sticks and things in a temper.

Then he stops, calming himself, gathering his thoughts,
and marches out of the woods.

EXT. ROAD DAY

 

Bob walks out of the woods. Dianne is by the side of the
road, and Rick is inside of the car.

Bob opens the rear door of the car and gets his clothes
out of the back and puts them in the back of the truck.

He pauses, not looking at Dianne or Rick, but aware that
they are watching him. Bob can't look back at Dianne.

RICK

Dianne bends down to the driver's window and smiles at
Rick.

DIANNE
Hell, I don't know. - But let's just start
worrying about us. Now I know you're ten
years younger than I am, but I'm not looking
for romance anyway. I'm looking for someone
with guts. You get you an old lady, and I'll
get me an old man, and we won't pick them
because they're beautiful people, we'll pick
the ones that will make the best thieves in
our helling crew, and baby, everyone will dive
on this crew. It won't be no one man show.

Dianne turns around and runs to the other side of the car
and gets in.

DIANNE
Oh, well, they say that God looks out for
drunks and fools, and He sure enough looked
out for Bob on occasion, and maybe He'd look
out for him now too.

Bob SMILES at the countryside.
The voice of GENTRY, the police lieutenant, is heard.

GENTRY'S VOICE
Looks like you're hooked to the gills, and we
got witnesses this time Bob.

DOUBLE EXPOSED over Bob's smile is Gentry, saying these
words in the back of the surveillance camper.

Gentry's EXPOSURE has given way the THE HAT; Bob's smile
remains in the corner of the screen; and Dianne is seen
as well.

NADINE
Why a hat?

BOB'S VOICE
You just put a thirty day hex on us.

DIANNE'S SMART SISTER
Why don't you just leave Dianne, Bob, and go
join one of those female impersonator clubs?
You shouldn't have any trouble at at all
getting a membership from what I can see, and
you'd no doubt be happy learning to enjoy
contributing to a normal segment of our
community.

BOB'S VOICE
Dianne could put up with anything from her man
as long as he was a successful drug thief.

Bob's smile, it is beginning to mouth the name Dianne,
over the moving countryside out of the window, and an
exposure of the hat having disappeared. Images of Dianne
flash over the countryside.

BOB'S VOICE
She doesn't particularly care what her man
looks like, how he acts or what he says to her
during breakfast. Like other women she loves
a man who can produce, and she loves with
great intensity. She'll spit in a cop's eye
in a minute. She's virtually fearless in all
respects. But if he doesn't produce, well
then, that's it; goodbye to her man.

INT. BUS NIGHT

Bob looks around the bus. He's showing signs of
withdrawal.

Sitting across the aisle from him is a darling old
grandma knitting.

BOB'S VOICE
Isn't she a cute old grandma? Knitting so
fastidiously. To look at her one wouldn't
think she had ever done anything in her whole
life but raise her children and her children's
children. But who knows, she might have been
a hooker and a bawdy dancer in Alaska during
the gold rush. She could have murdered
fourteen people and skinned them alive for all
anyone knew. But right now, right this
minute, she is a darling old grandma and most
likely that's all she's ever been.

Have any of these passengers been in as insane
a situation as I am in now?

VIEW of a rumpled drunk guy sitting in back of Bob.

BOB'S VOICE

Now take that guy sittin there. He's half
crocked now, rumpled and grubby as any bum on
skid row. And who was he? He could very
easily have been an upstanding businessman
just a few years ago. Plenty of the bums and
winos of today were just that not so long
ago. Or he might have been a hit man for the
Mafia.

Bob grins at his fantasizing.

A name tag on her desk reads MRS. WATERMAKER.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Well, young man, what can we do for you this
morning?

BOB
I want to sign up for your withdrawal program.

MRS. WATERMAKER
I see. And when was the last time you took
whatever you use?

BOB
Night before last.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Are you going to get violently sick today
then? You realize that to get right on the
withdrawal program that you have to be in the
third stage of withdrawal, sweating, stomach
cramps...chills...temperature, and so on?

BOB
Yes.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Have you ever been on either the maintenance
or withdrawal program before?

BOB
No.

MRS. WATERMAKER

whatever you're on now? .

MRS. WATERMAKER
All your life?

A little skepticism flashes across Mrs. Watermaker's
face.

BOB
Well, since I've been twelve or thirteen I've
been using narcotics. I guess you could say
that was all my life.

MRS. WATERMAKER
How old are you now?

BOB
Twenty six.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Why do you want to quit now, after all that
time? I'd think you'd be inclined to go right
on with it. Why quit now?

Bob shrugged and grinned.

BOB
I don't know, curiosity I guess. I just
thought I'd try it.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Are you serious? I mean, we get a lot of guys
and gals coming up here just trying to get in
on a new kick and that's not what we're here
for.

BOB
Well, lady, you just found you one of those
people what ain't got any other way to turn,
so give me a jolt and let me go on my merry
way.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Oh, my, it's not that easy, young man. You've
got all kinds of paperwork to £111 out.

You've got a doctor's examination to go
through and then maybe, just maybe, we'll help
you out. You've got to get sick first too,
you know.

Bob grins and throws up on the floor.

listens to a song on a radio.

Clouds part over the building.

INT. METHADONE CLINIC DAY

 

Bob is in a chair talking again to Mrs. Watermaker.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Let me see now, I wanted to ask you a few
things before we go on much further. Let's
see, are you married?

BOB
Yes.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Where is your wife?

_ BOB
I don't know.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Hmm, I see. Do you have any children?

BOB
Nope.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Do you have a job?

BOB
Nope.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Do you have a social security number?
yrau-bo

BOB
No.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Hmmm. I see, have you ever been convicted of
a felony?

BOB
Yes. A few times.

MRS. WATERMAKER
What were they? What kind of felonies were
you convicted of?

BOB
Oh, burglary, robbery, possession, grand
theft, stuff like that.

MRS. WATERMAKER
And how much time have you spent in prison?

BOB
I don't know. Twelve years more or less I
suppose.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Well, then, you haven't been an addict all
your life then, have you, Mr. Hughes?

BOB
what do you mean?

MRS. WATERMAKER
I mean you could hardly have been an addict in
prison now, could you Mr. Hughes?

BOB
Why not?

MRS. WATERMAKER
Do you mean to sit there and tell me that you
were addicted to drugs while in prison?

BOB

Well, not all the time. But I used all the
time I was inside, I mean, what do you want,
lady, my life story? Well, I'll tell it to
you. I was a junkie. I liked dope. I liked
the lifestyle. I was on top of it all but it
wasn't real. You don't see my kind of people,
because my kind of people don't come down here
and beg dope. They go out and get it and if
they miss, they go to jail and then they kick
alone without nothing in some holding tank.
192

y-ib-b6
83

MRS. WATERMAKER
I'm sorry, Bob. I don't mean to hassle you.
All this is required. I'm sorry if it seems
unnecessary. Have you ever thought about
becoming a counselor and helping other addicts
with their problems?

BOB
(without hesitation)
No, I don't think so, ma'am.

MRS. WATERMAKER
Why not?

BOB
Well, to begin with, no one, and I mean no one
can talk a junkie out of using, so all your
counseling is just wasted words and you might
as well have flushed them down the toilet. A
junkie needs his thing nine times out of ten
just to be able to live with himself. He
needs it just like a diabetic needs insulin.
How are you going to sit and talk a diabetic
out of using insulin?

MRS. WATERMAKER
Hmmm, I see, well, tell me, Bob, if you can,
why did you use narcotics?

Bob sits and squirms in his chair. He looks out the
office window.

BOB
That really is a tough question, lady. I may
think I know the answer, and then maybe I
don't. When you ask a dope fiend why he uses,
it's just about like asking a normal person
why they like sex. And I suppose different
people will come up with different answers,
ranging from it just feels good, to I can't
resist the urge, to it's all part of love, to
I only do it to have children. Lady, a dope
fiend will give you just about the same
answers, with the exception of the last one.
I've yet to hear a dope fiend claim he shot
dope in an attempt to have children.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY DAY ex
Bob is sitting by the window, watching cars and people go
by outside.

The elevator doors open and TOM walks out, past the hotel
desk, where a tall, cadaverish CLERK is sorting mail.
The Clerk sees Tom.

CLERK
Hey Tom, there's a letter for you here.

TOM
(accepting the letter)
Bless you.

Tom opens it, walking across the lobby to the chairs by
the window, and sits down to read. Bob has recognized
him.

BOB
Father Murphy? Hey, Tom.

TOM
(peering at Bob)
Well, well. . . bad Bobby Hughes. Imagine
seeing you here after all these years.

BOB
Yeah, it's been a long time. You living here
too?

TOM

I have nowhere else to go. There is no demand
in the priesthood for elderly drug addicts.

An indiscretion back in '70 -- you were
"inside" at the time, I believe -- resulted in
my descent to this sorry state. As a matter
of fact I am feeling a bit sick right now.

Are you holding?

BOB
Naw, I am kicking like a goddamn mule. Those
bastards at the methadone clinic want me good
and sick before they'll process my
application. But you ought to be able to get
on easy?

TOM

(absently tearing bits of paper from the

letter)
Sure I'm on the program. But sometimes I get
a little ahead of my schedule, you
understand. Sometimes I think that nurse is
lightening them up, but who knows. So how
about it, you want to score?

BOB
Not me, Tom. But I'll keep you company.

EXT PARK DAY ae
Bob and Tom sitting on park bench.
INT. TOM'S ROOM DAY ae

Tom and Bob are sitting in the small room, talking.

TOM
« . ». SO they are cooking up the shot ina big
spoon and this little guy that was sitting in
the corner, you wouldn't notice him, is
standing there with one foot off the ground,
like he's going to kick the spoon out of their
hands, and he says, "Draw my shot up nice and
easy, or it ain't nobody gets any." And it's
a bluff they don't care to call. So they give
him his shot, and he goes back off in the
corner to enjoy his medications.

BOB
And they didn't kick his ass.?!

TOM
What's the point? These junkies, they figure
the little guy made his play, he had the guts,
what the hell. They understand. And, after
that, they watched him closer.

BOB
You know, Tom, you taught me a lot, like stay
out of a boy and girl fight. All the old time
stories, how yoou used to stick your arm
through the bars of the cell and a guard would
fire you up a shot of morphine. They never
did that for me.

TOM
Narcotics have been demonized and scapegoated
in this country. To those who do not use, it
is a sin, or a crime, or an illness. The very
idea that anyone could use drugs and avoid a
horrible fate is anathema to these idiots.
They are morally ravaged victims of the Right
Virus, and they seem to have the whip hand on
planet Earth, at the present time. In the
future I predict they will exploit a domestic
drug panic as a masquerade behind which to
prop up their international police state. But
I'm an old man, and maybe I won't live to see
the whole shithouse go up.

Bob closes the door and locks it, but sitting behind him
is Detective GENTRY, in a chair next to the bed, under a
reading lamp.

Bob smoothly takes off his coat and hangs it up.
(Nothing to hide attitude)

BOB
Catching up on some reading, Gentry?

Gentry ignores the remark.

GENTRY
You didn't stay gone long, Bob, what happened?

BOB
Nothing happened.

Bob plops onto his bed and braces his hands behind his
head.

GENTRY
I hear you're on a methadone program now. Now
you don't think that's going to keep Halamer
from jumping you, do you, Bob?

BOB
To tell the truth, I hadn't given it much
thought.

GENTRY

Well, I want to tell you, warn you, that
Halamer's pissed. He lost his gold badge, you
know, over that little fracas. He's now
working traffic out in the north end. He's
made so many damn threats, told so many people
that he's almost going to have to hurt you
now.

BOB
What about the Trousinski? How's he feeling
about the whole affair?

GENTRY
Don't you worry about Trousinski, Bob, he's
not really dangerous. He just does his job
the best way he knows how.

BOB
Well, I don't know what to tell you, I gota
Job, you know. I start work tomorrow.

BOB
You know how whimsical women are. She finally
found another dude to chase after, and down
the road she went, chasing after him.

GENTRY
You know what Bob, I've known you and Dianne
since we were all kids and I find that a
little hard to believe.

Gentry rises from his chair.

GENTRY
I'll see you around, Bob, and I sincerely hope
you make out on that job you've got and
straighten up a bit.

thunder booms out slightly after.

EXT. STREET NIGHT

A car pulls up to the curb and a shadowy figure gets out
and enters the Hotel.

INT. BOB'S ROOM NIGHT ak

A knock comes on the door. Bob is laying in bed playing
solitaire. He gets up and answers the knock. A sad old
COUNTRY AND WESTERN tune is playing on a little radio by
Bob's bed.

BOB
Who's there?

DIANNE'S VOICE
It's me, Dianne.

Bob throws the door open and smiles. Dianne steps in
hesitantly and looks around at the room's dismal
appearance. She looks shocked.
9-10-88

DIANNE
Jesus, what kind of dump is this? And where's
the female? You might as well trot her out.

BOB
You don't ever change, do you, Dianne?

DIANNE
You goddamn right I don't. Why should 1?

BOB
I was just remarking on how good you look. I
didn't mean nothing by it.

DIANNE
I'll bet. You're slipperier than an eel, Bob,
no one ever catches you off balance because
you stay off balance constantly, just to stay
on your feet.

BOB
Is that all you got to say? Is that why you
come up here, or did you just want to see me
down and out?

DIANNE
I just wanted to see you period. How's that
methadone thing?

BOB
Oh, so-so. I got a job, bet you never
expected to see that.

DIANNE
No shit, where're you working?

BOB
Oh, down at some machine shop on Western.

DIANNE
What do you do there?

BOB
Drill holes.

DIANNE
Drill holes?

BOB
Yeah, you know, like the holes that bolts fit
into and such.

DIANNE
Oh yeah? How do you like it?
9-10-88

BOB
Well, to tell you the truth, it's kind of a
drag.

DIANNE
Then you're really serious. You're going to
go on with this thing.

BOB
Yeah, I am, Dianne. Sit down here, why don't
you take off your coat and stay awhile.

DIANNE
Oh, I can't Bob, I got people waiting for me
down in the car. I just came up to see how
you was doing. Here...

Dianne struggles with something in her purse, and comes
up with a small package.

Bob smiles

DIANNE
This is from Rick and the rest of us. We kind
of thought you might need a taste once in
awhile.

and takes the package.
BOB

Thanks, Dianne. I sure do appreciate you all
thinking of me.

DIANNE
Bob?

BOB
Yeah?

DIANNE

What happened? What made you turn around that
day? Was it me, did I do something wrong? Or
was it just that thing with Nadine?

BOB
No, baby, it wasn't you. It was Nadine's
death and the hex that she threw on us with
the hat. And then I panicked when I looked
out into that parking lot and seen all those
cop cars. I just knew I was dead. Everything
up to then had gone wrong and so I started
coping deuces. I prayed like never before. I
said “God, Devil, Sun, whoever you are up
there that controls this whirly-girly mad
tumbling world, please have pity on me.
Please let me get this poor girl's body out of
yroLu-bo
91

BOB
(continued)

this motel room and into the ground so I don't
have to spend the rest of my life in prison.
And God, Sun, Satan, if you'll] do that for me,
I'll show my appreciation by going back to the
coast, getting on a methadone program, getting
a job and living the good life." Well, I got
out, and I promised, so here I am.

DIANNE
Are you going to stick to it forever?

BOB
Yeah. And, you know, for all the boredom the
good life brings, it's not so bad. Even this
crummy little room isn't so bad. I'ma
regular guy. I got my regular job. And my
regular room. Now I got my woman. . .

Dianne sits down on the bed and sighs.

DIANNE
You're crazy, Bob, you are really crazy. But
I see what you mean. Jesus, Bob, if I had
known what it was all about, I'd have come
along with you, I thought you were mad at me
for something.

BOB
Why don't you go tell your friends you're
going to stay the night, and then come back up
here and bed down with me for awhile?

DIANNE

I'd like to Bob,

(Dianne lowers her eyes)
but I got another old man now. I work for
Rick now, ain't that a gas? There we were
teaching the brat to steal, and now I'm on his
crew. Things sure can get screwed around,
can't they?

Bob nods yes.

DIANNE
I'd like to stay the night with you really I
would. Only I'm Rick's old lady now. And you
know me, Bob, I might have been a lot of
things, but I never was a tramp.

Bob manages a smile. A long pause.

TOM

BOB
A little gift, someone left it for me last
night, but I'm not going to need it, seein' as
how I've got my new program going, so you take
it.

INT. ROOM DAY xk

They both step into the room and Tom shuts and locks the
door behind him.

He lays the sock on the bedside table and empties the
contents.

BOB
I don't know exactly what's in it, but...

TOM
God Bless you my son. May you go to heaven.
Let's see just what's in this. Oh, yeah -
this is for squares, never touch the stuff.
Now this here, this bottle of one hundred
sixteenths of dilaudid, this could come in
handy. This will certainly earn you an
indulgence.

BOB
I'm not so sure. I've come a long, weird road
since I knew you as a kid, Tom. I took
everything you told me and took it further.
Hitting the poisons when everybody else was
cleaning up, getting on the program. I hada
good run, but people got hurt. People were

shot, busted, people died. I can't do it
anymore. The girl I married still thinks
she's Ma Barker but I'm thinking like Pa
Kettle. My cross-roading days are done, I
guess I hope to never see another sitting-duck
Pharmacy. And I have to confess I don't know
what it was all for.

TOM

(measuring his words)
There are more things than our feet that carry
us to sin, my son. Few things in my own past
I'd just as soon forget. Who can say who gets
a second chance? But I hope you make it, kid,
may I fall down and be paralyzed if I don't
mean it.

INT. HALL NIGHT DUSK

Bob leaves Tom's room and strides lightly down the
stairs.-

INT. BOB'S ROOM NIGHT

Bob opens the door and enters, opening up his closet to
hang up his coat. The HAMMER OF A GUN CLICKS, and as Bob
steps back, a man wearing a ski mask steps out of the
closet with the gun aimed at Bob.

MASK
Where's it at, Bob, where's it at?

CLOSE VIEW of Bob's head, there is a ROARING NOISE froma
blow, and Bob is sent to the floor.

BOB
I don't know what you're talking about. What
do you want?

MASK
We want your dope, man, where's the dope?

Bob squirms on the floor as his mind races.

BOB
Man, I ain't got no dope. You think I'd be
living in this flea trap 1£ I had any dope?
Hell, I'm on the methadone program, and you
guys come to me to rob for dope? Boy, that
sure is a laugh.
9-10-88
95

Bob tries to make his point by letting out a laugh, but
it doesn't work. The laugh doesn't come out right. It
sounds more like a howl.

MASK
Okay, buster. You want it the hard way and
we're just the dudes that can give it to you.

Bob seems to recognize the voice.

BOB
Is that your voice, David?

David kicks him again in the head. Hands tie Bob's hands
together.

BOB
David, you little punk. I'm telling you the
truth. I'm going straight. You ought to try
it sometime. It's good for the soul.

DAVID
Fucking liar! Where is it, Bob? We heard you
were here. We know this is all a scam you're
Playing.

The figures begin to kick Bob. And no matter how he
moved he couldn't get away from their blows.

DAVID
Where is it, Bob, where is it?

BOB'S VOICE OVER
Just like on TV, fucking TV babies. What is
the world coming to with all these TV babies.
What are people going to do once they snap
that they have raised a whole new breed of
little monsters?

FINALLY THE ATTACKERS are out of breath, breathing hard
through their ski masks.

BOB'S VOICE OVER
Hell, I should have stayed on the road, I was
stupid to think that cleaning up my hand would
make any difference to the hat.

DAVID
So where is it?!

doesn't have it or he's going to die before he

No response. David raises the pistol (a twenty-two) and
shoots Bob once in the back.
INT. NEXT DOOR ARTMENT NIGHT

An older WOMAN has her ear to the wall, when she hears
the shots, she coils back.

She listens some more and hears the TWO leave.

The old woman sees that the hallway is clear. She races

to Bob's room; sees Bob on the ground, getting up. She
goes to the end of the hall and calls on a pay phone.

INT. /EXT. HOTEL NIGHT

Detective Gentry arrives outside the Hotel just as they
are bringing Bob out on a stretcher.

One look at Bob convinces Gentry that Bob is hurt badly.
No, Bob doesn't look good at all.

Was it Halamer?

Bob shakes his head from side to side meaning no, the
lights from streetlights play with his face.

Gentry wipes his brow, glad that Halamer wasn't
responsible.

GENTRY
Who got you? What happened?
BOB
The hat.
Gentry leans closer.
GENTRY

The hat, Bob? Did you say the hat?

Gentry reaches into a pocket and takes out a little black
book to write in.

Bob nods yes. Gentry writes it down.

BOB
Tell Dianne to watch out for the hat. Tell
her.
GENTRY
Okay, Bob, tell Dianne to watch out for the
hat.
Again Bob nods.
GENTRY

Did the hat shoot you, Bob?

BOB
No, the TV baby shot me.

GENTRY
The TV baby shot you, Bob, but the hat sent
them, is that it?
Bob laughs at Gentry

BOB
Never mind. I'11 tell her myself.

Gentry is a bit confused, but writes it down in the black
book.

Close VIEW of Bob's face, his smile, and the VIEW tilts
up to see out the ambulance window.
