"Don't think of this like a comedy, think of it like a world
wide vfx giant summer tentpole that just happens to be funnier
than the typical world wide giant summer tentpole."

*- Not THAT Steven Spielberg , another one. This one repairs
ladies' footwear in El Segundo and was just a big fan of the
script and wanted to explain that to all of you before you read
it.
EXT. SUBURBS, DELAWARE, SUMMER OF 1982 - DAY 1

Our hero, SAM BRENNER, 13, rides his bike through the suburbs.
Fast, crazed. CHEAP TRICK’S “SURRENDER” (BUDDAKAN VERSION)
PLAYS AS CREDITS BEGIN.

EXT. HOUSE, SUBURBS - DAY 2

As the song continues, WILL COOPER, age 13, is mowing his
lawn. His cute LITTLE SISTER is on the sidewalk, operating
a lemonade stand. Brenner arrives, SKIDS his bike to a stop.
Cooper looks at him. Brenner smiles.

YOUNG BRENNER
It’s open.

Cooper abandons the lawn mower, grabs his bike and starts to
pedal off with Brenner. Then he stops, runs back to the
lemonade stand, and takes a big jar of coins.

LITTLE SISTER
Hey!

EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 3

Brenner and Cooper pass a movie theater showing “Poltergeist”
and pull their bikes into a parking lot. Each stares ahead in
awe. CAMERA PANS around them, REVEALS what they’re looking at:
THE ELECTRIC DREAMS ARCADE. A BIG GRAND OPENING SIGN hangs
from the roof.

INT. ARCADE - DAY 4

Its like going into another world. All the classic games are
lined up: PAC MAN, DONKEY KONG, CENTIPEDE, SPACE INVADERS,
GALAGA, Q-BERT, PAPERBOY, ASTEROIDS, BREAKOUT. And they’re
all BRAND NEW. The guys enter. Cooper opens the mason jar,
both guys grab a handful of quarters and they fan out.

Brenner waits in line for the holy grail: PAC MAN, watching
OTHERS playing and losing. He studies their moves, the game’s
controls, taking in every success, every failure.

Cooper plays GALAGA. On screen we see him GETTING KILLED BY
THE ALIEN/BUG INVADERS THREE TIMES REAL QUICK. He’s terrible.

It’s Brenner’s turn on Pac Man. He steps up, puts in his
quarter and starts to play. Cooper steps up, watching over
his shoulder.

YOUNG COOPER
Which one’s the alien, Sam, the
cheese wedge guy or the rainbow
blobs?

*
Numbered Script (04/17/2014) 2.

YOUNG BRENNER
Neither. Those blobs are ghosts,
and the cheese wedge is Pac Man.
He’s a... I don’t know what he is,
but he seems like a good guy.

Cooper shakes his head, looks at the game Brenner's playing:
cU of an 80’s 8 Bit video screen as PACMAN RACES ACROSS IT.

YOUNG COOPER
Wow. How are you so good at this
game? You’ve never even played it
before.

YOUNG BRENNER
I don’t know. There’s a pattern to how
they are moving. Watch...

He does. ON SCREEN the game seems to slow down. We see
numbers and arrows superimposed over the action in Brenner's
eyes. He knows exactly where the ghosts are going, when the
bonus cherries are going to appear, etc.

YOUNG COOPER
I don’t see it. But you sure do.

CHEAP TRICK’S SONG continues as CREDITS PLAY OVER:

- MONTAGE of Brenner playing: Centipede, Q-Bert, Galaga,
Defender being played at a high level (intercut with other
80s kids, janitors, etc. watching slack-jawed), high score
after high score, crowds growing, “SAM” taking over the
entire top ten scores.

- As a huge crowd has gathered around Brenner, Cooper plays
“the Crane Game” by himself in a lonely corner. He deftly
maneuvers the claw over an array of stuffed animals and
rubber masks. Cooper lowers the claw over a Chewbacca mask.
the claw grabs it, but it gets stuck. Will Cooper get it?

CUT TO Brenner playing ASTEROIDS, surrounded by a respectful
crowd. He steps away from the machine.

YOUNG BRENNER
Sorry, folks, I gotta eat.

His guy “dies”. The crowd applauds and pats him on the back
as he walks over to Cooper - standing there in the Chewbacca
mask. He hands Brenner a “Reggie” bar.

YOUNG COOPER
You can’t stop playing, can you?
You're like a video game addict.

YOUNG BRENNER
You don’t understand, buddy. I suck
at sports, I suck at school.

YOUNG BRENNER (CONT'D)
Video games is the first thing I’ve
ever been good at.

YOUNG COOPER
You're not “good” at video games,
Sam - you're the best.
(hands him flyer)
And it’s time to show the world.

Brenner reads the flyer - “WORLD VIDEO GAME CHAMPIONSHIPS”.
INT. WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS - NIGHT 5

The Super Bowl of video games. Hundreds of PEOPLE are there.
NEWSCASTERS report. Cooper is massaging Brenner’s fingers.

YOUNG BRENNER
I can’t believe I’m doing this,
man. I wish you’d signed up too.

YOUNG COOPER
I stink at every game. Except for
the crane-claw thing.

YOUNG BRENNER
You're good at everything else,
Chewie: talking people into
things... Making up stories...
Brushing your hair just right...
Looking like you're smarter than
you really are...

YOUNG COOPER
Yeah, what’s that gonna get me?

He trails off as he overhears someone nearby talking...

VOICE (0.C.)
Hi... This is a pretty good
party...Actually, I hate parties...

Brenner looks over to the next machine to see LUDLOW
LAMONSOFF (8, glasses. Genius, no social skills). Ludlow is
playing CASTLE QUEST (made-up 8 bit game) and talking under
his breath to the LADY LISA character (we see her beautiful
illustration on the side of the machine).

YOUNG LUDLOW
You too? That’s so funny. My name’s
Ludlow by the way... Well nice to
meet you, Lady Lisa... Really? I
think you're pretty darn foxy
yourself...

He finally notices Brenner and Cooper staring at him and is
embarrassed.

YOUNG BRENNER
You're the wonder kid, Ludlow
Lamonsoff, right? Heard you're
pretty good. *

YOUNG LUDLOW
Who told you that? The government?
Cause they've been tracking me. I’m
close to figuring out the secret of
the Bermuda Triangle, and the
“powers that be” aren’t too happy
about it.

HF

YOUNG COOPER
Wow. You don’t have any friends, do
you?

YOUNG LUDLOW
Just my mom.

He gestures toward his MOM, who is sitting on a stool in the
corner, holding a bag lunch and a six-pack of Yoo-Hoo. She
shrugs and waves. *

YOUNG BRENNER
Well, you can hang out with us too. *

They shake hands. *

There’s a hubub at the front door: EDDIE PLANT has arrived. *
He’s dressed in parachute pants, a Twisted Sister T-shirt and

a rat tail, and is flanked by two hot 80’s looking girls in
leather pants (their t-shirts identify them as the CYBER

GIRLZ).

YOUNG EDDIE PLANT
What’s up, geeks and goobers? They
call me the Fire Blaster. Because
my hands are blazing fast, and also
I will blast and burn all my
competitors’ weak-ass moves. *

Eddie saunters over toward Ludlow.

YOUNG EDDIE PLANT (CONT'D)
You must be the local talent. If
this was an ugly contest, I'd be in
trouble.

YOUNG BRENNER
At least we didn’t make up our own
nicknames, Fire Blaster.

YOUNG EDDIE PLANT
Who cares who came up with it? It’s
totally tubular!
Numbered Script (04/17/2014) 5.

Brenner and Eddie glare at each other. An MC steps on stage.

M.C.
Welcome, gamers, to the First *
Annual Arcade World Championships. *

We have representatives here from
the Guinness Book of World Records,
as well as NASA, who will be
videotaping tonight’s competition *
to be included in a compilation of
1982's news events and popular
culture. That video tape will be
placed in an orbiter that will be *
launched out into the solar system *
to search for proof of Extra-
Terrestrial life.
(ET voice)
ET phone home!

People APPLAUD, IMPRESSED. Eddie Plant makes the “choke” sign
at Brenner. Brenner shakes his head. Ludlow, nervous, looks
like he is gonna piss himself as they head to the games.
Cooper cheers them on.

It’s like the OLYMPICS as they all step up to play, total
seriousness. There are about a dozen competitors: mostly teen
boys but a punk chick and some weird middle-aged men (one
wearing a Karate Kid headband) mixed in. We see them move the
controls, put their quarters in and pound the buttons in SLO
MO as the judges watch all the contestants. *

+ +

-Brenner plays BREAKOUT zen-cool as slo-mo Cooper cheers him
on.

-Ludlow is sweating profusely playing GALAGA. His mother is
next to him, holding up a Yoo-Hoo for him to sip from.

-Eddie is kissing one of the Cyber Girlz as he annihilates
PAC MAN. He lowers his sunglasses over his eyes, then really
starts kicking ass. *

*

-ONSTAGE, the M.C. addresses the crowd dramatically.

M.C. (CONT'D)
Ladies and gentlemen, what an
evening we've had here: six new US
records set, three new world
records set, and now, when the
smoke clears, we have... a tie! 259
points for your new Pac Man world
champion... The Fire Blaster, Eddie
Plant!

(applause)
And 259 points for your new Galaga
and Centipede world champion...

rookie sensation Sam Brenner! *
(shocked applause)
Gentlemen, shall we break this tie? *

M.C. (CONT'D)
Let’s play--
(a beat)
Donkey Kong! !

Brenner and Eddie both smile confidently. They start walking
toward the machines.

YOUNG BRENNER
Good luck, man.

YOUNG EDDIE PLANT
I don’t need luck, nerd. Cause if I
lose right now, I go home knowing I
don’t got what it takes; a nothing,
a failure, someone who looked
Destiny in the eye and blinked. And
the Fire Blaster never, ever
blinks.

Eddie stares unblinking at Brenner as they insert their
quarters.

They play furiously. The Cyber Girlz cheer on Eddie; Cooper,
Ludlow and Ludlow’s Mom cheer on Brenner. Brenner starts to
pull ahead, Eddie’s in deep trouble. But then Eddie lowers
his sunglasses, gets serious and starts mounting an
improbable comeback.

YOUNG COOPER
Finish him, Sam!

But Eddie is suddenly racking up the points. We see BRENNER’S
POV: he’s lost the pattern. He rubs his eyes; the focus is
gone. ON SCREEN, through Brenner's eyes, the game is actually
speeding up, the superimposed arrows and numbers getting
scratched out and changing direction rapidly.

Eddie and Brenner are each down to their last guy, playing
their hearts out, until we hear... the DONKEY KONG death
sound. But who died? Eddie turns to Brenner.

YOUNG EDDIE PLANT
Congratulations - on being a loser!

Brenner steps back from the machine. Stunned.

WE PUSH IN on the look of utter disappointment and
devastation on his face as he realizes he lost at the one
thing he was great at, as Eddie rants on in the background.

EDDIE PLANT (0.C.)
YEAH!!! Fire Blaster is the WORLD
CHAMP!!! THE LOCAL YOKEL COULDN'T
HANDLE THE PRESSURE! !

EXT. GEORGETOWN MANSION - DAY 6 *

“SAM BRENNER”. A NAMETAG. CAMERA PULLS BACK. It is PRESENT *
DAY. The nametag belongs to the actual ADULT BRENNER, pinned

to his BRIGHTLY COLORED ORANGE JUMPSUIT, that identifies him

as being in the NERD PATROL.

He carries a clipboard and is miserable, depressed. He steps
up to the front door of a GEORGETOWN MANSION and KNOCKS. A
HANDSOME, YOUNGER FIT MAN, answers.

BRENNER
(like he wants to die)
Hello, I am a NERD from the Nerd
Patrol here to deal with your
audio/visual needs.

The Fit Man turns and walks inside, calling out.

FIT MAN
The nerd’s here!

Brenner sighs, he hates his life.
INT. GEORGETOWN MANSION - DAY 7
Brenner installs a 70 inch 4K Sony TV to the wall of a

gigantic living room. As Brenner lifts the TV to mount it on *
the wall, he glances outside, through a large picture window.

*

BRENNER’S POV: The handsome home owner lies on a lounge
chair, beside his GORGEOUS WIFE. They drink champagne,
watching their TWO BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN relax on rafts, *
drinking smoothies, in their state of the art pool. *

Brenner watches them, with a longing for a life he’ll never
know. His expression says it all: Must be nice.

THIRD CHILD (0.C.) *

Pretty sweet life, eh? *

Brenner, startled, drops the TV, which smashes. *
Brenner sees another kid (7) standing nearby, in a polo *
shirt, looking smug, drinking a smoothie. *

Yeah it does. Got any tape? *

INT. BAR, WASHINGTON DC - DAY 8

Still in uniform, Brenner sits across from COOPER also 45. He
is dressed in a blue blazer and open collar shirt. They’re
eating lunch at a table near the bar.

BRENNER
Look, Chewie, I don’t know why I’m
giving you romantic advice; you always
did way better with chicks than I did.

COOPER
Not always. Remember that chick in
Ft. Lauderdale? The redhead who was
all over you?

BRENNER
That was my cousin. Moving on. If I
were you, I'd take one hour a day
where you shut down the phone, turn
off the email, the ESPN, put down
the Reggie bar and just devote your
full attention to your wife.

COOPER
I can’t shut off my phone and
email, man; I gotta be reachable
24/7. Not all of us work out of a
van.

BRENNER
Yeah, I get it, I have a crappy
job. I’m a failure, I wear orange
shorts, my wife left me for a
busboy...

PRESIDENT COOPER
Don’t give me some sob story,
Brenner. You were meant for
something more than this.

BRENNER
Why would you think that? I was
never really good at anything.

PRESIDENT COOPER
You were good at one thing. Best I
ever saw.

BRENNER
Second best. And playing old-timey
videogames ain’t a real lucrative
career path nowadays.

PRESIDENT COOPER
Hang on, I gotta see this...

Brenner turns. ON TV WE SEE CHRIS MATTHEWS on MSNBC.

CHRIS MATTHEWS (ON TV)
The President’s gaffe-filled summer
continued today during an appearance at
Joseph Knibb Elementary School to promote
his new youth reading initiative. Here’s
what happened...

ON TV WE SEE Cooper in a classroom, reading to a class of
FIRST-GRADERS who have gathered on the rug around him.
Parents, teachers, etc. stand watching excitedly.

COOPER (ON TV)
(dramatic)
.--But then, Mittens jumped up on
to the table, and knocked over the
whole bowl of soup! Mrs. Pickles
gassed - gasped, and the whole room
fell silent. “This is casta...
(struggling with word)
catsa... catatastrophic?...”

LITTLE GIRL (SUNNY)
Catastrophic!

COOPER (ON TV)
(a little loud)
I got it, thanks, sweetheart!

The Little Girl looks like she’s about to cry.
ON TV, back to Chris Matthews.

CHRIS MATTHEWS
Seems like if the President's
approval ratings don’t improve, the
results of the next election could
be... catsatatsastrophic.

Back in the bar, Brenner is laughing.

BRENNER
You really should learn how to
read.

PRESIDENT COOPER
I was on three hours sleep!!

We pull back further and see that there are A TON OF SECRET
SERVICE AGENTS there. People are peeking in the windows
excitedly.

BRENNER
Dude, I gotta get out of here; I
got a 2 o’clock install. You
getting this, or...

Cooper just stares at him, looking sheepish.

BRENNER (CONT'D)

PRESIDENT COOPER
I forgot my wallet!

Brenner turns to the AGENTS, disgusted.

BRENNER
Could one of you seven guys grab
his wallet before he walks out the
door next time?! Please? I’m broke,
he’s the President!

EXT. GUAM - SKY - NIGHT 9

A CLOUDY night sky. Behind the clouds, we see the eerie image
of a LARGE ALIEN CRAFT. We can’t make out any details.
Suddenly, A WIDE LIGHT PORTAL OPENS. We HEAR A CLICKING
SOUND.

From out of the clouds, we see a cloud of BRIGHTLY-COLORED
CUBES. They loop down from the stars and FORM A STREAM. In a
TIGHT FORMATION.

The cubes TURN and FLY DOWN A DIRT ROAD, their intense FORCE
sends waves of POWERFUL WIND through the trees.

The cubes ZOOM PAST A SIGN THAT READS: ANDERSON AIR FORCE
BASE. GUAM, USA.

EXT. GEORGETOWN HOUSE - DAY 10
A modest house. A door opens. A 13 YEAR OLD KID stands there.

MATTY
Are you the Nerd?

BRENNER
No, I just like to wear this because
I think I look awesome.
(the kid just stares at him)
Yeah, I’m the Nerd.

MATTY
Isn't that kind of demeaning?

Only if someone brings it up.

11 INT. HOUSE - CONTINUING 11
Matty leads Brenner in. He looks around. It’s a warm house.

BRENNER
So what am I installing?

MATTY
A new 85 inch SONY 4k 3D TV. Playstation
4. 7.1 Surround sound speakers. Really,
if you guys sell it, we bought it.

BRENNER
Wow, is it your birthday?

MATTY
My parents are getting a divorce.

BRENNER
Oh, that’s like ten birthdays.

MATTY
My Dad cheated on my Mom with his 18 year
old pilates instructor. Her name is
Sinnamon with an S. I shit you not; that is
her name. I mean I should be dating an 18
year old pilates instructor, not him.

BRENNER
She'd break you in half, dude, but I
get your larger point.

MATTY
Anyway my Mom kinda hates him right now
for being a major d-bag asswipe, her words,
not mine. She felt bad that I’m going
through this so she sold his Porsche on
Ebay to buy me all this-

VIOLET (0.S.)
Okay, Matty, we don’t need to tell the
nice installer man our whole life.

Brenner turns and sees VIOLET KELLY (LATE 30's) beautiful,
smart, tough. Brenner sees her and then involuntarily utters:

BRENNER
Whoa.

VIOLET
I’m sorry, whoa what?

BRENNER
(embarrassed now)
.»-No, just you...whoa.

told me that your husband left you for
an 18 year-old I kinda thought maybe you *
were one of those hot-when-we-met-in
high-school, but then got-older-let-
herself-go and now has like neck fuzz
and a pot belly with cottage-cheese
thighs. But that’s clearly not what you
look like. So more like whoa, I should
have probably brushed my teeth before I
left the house, or studio apartment, if *
we're getting real here.

MATTY
Do you have Tourettes?

BRENNER
Surprisingly no. Wish I did right now.

Violet laughs. There is definitely a connection. Matty notices.

BRENNER (CONT'D)
Okay, I guess I should start setting all
this stuff up.

VIOLET *
Alright, go get ‘em. *

Violet and Matty walk out. She turns and catches Brenner
looking and he pretends he was looking at her light fixtures
instead. She smiles to herself.

INT. GUAM MILITARY BASE - NIGHT 12 *

Bustling, filled with military personnel. CAMERA PANS to A
HANDSOME SAILOR, staring intently at a video monitor. AN
ARRAY OF COLORFUL SHAPES appear on the monitor, MOVING TOWARD
the center of the screen. The HANDSOME SAILOR’S face falls,
he SHOUTS to someone OFF CAMERA.

HANDSOME SAILOR
Captain Devereux! You need to see *
this--

CAPTAIN DEVEREUX, a tough, middle aged hatchet of a man with *
a crewcut, walks up, stares over the sailor’s shoulder. His

13 INT. VIOLET AND MATTY’S HOUSE - LATER - DAY 13

Brenner is setting up the video game system. Matty is hanging
out, watching him. Brenner notices him.

MATTY
So you a gamer?

BRENNER
Uh, I was when I was your age.

MATTY
Were you any good?

BRENNER
I was alright at some of the
classic games.

MATTY
Classics? You mean like “Halo”?

BRENNER
No, the real classics: Pac-Man,
Asteroids, Space Invaders. Games you
played at an arcade, which was a
building outside of your house. You’d
go with your friends, there was great
music playing, cute girls everywhere...

MATTY
I like games where you shoot people, and
their guts go flying everywhere, and
occasionally you have to rip someone's
spine out and then use to it to beat
someone else to death. It’s probably
genetic.

BRENNER
Why? Your mom’s a serial killer?

MATTY
No, she makes weapons for the military.

VIOLET (0.S.)

Matty, what are you saying?...

MATTY
Nothing, Mom. Sorry I mean she works

INT. GUAM AIRBASE - COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT 14

Chaos. SERVICEMEN RUN OUT to man their posts. They hear the
noise. BEEP BOP. BEEP BOP BOOP. That familiar arcade game
sound. FIGHTER PILOTS run down the tarmac towards their jets.
EXPLOSIONS coupled with VIDEO GAME SOUNDS FILL THE AIR. ONE
PILOT stops before getting in his plane, looks up at the air.
BLURRY COLORFUL IMAGES are REFLECTED IN HIS HELMET.

FIGHTER PILOT
What the hell are those things?

INT. GUAM COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT 15

LIGHTS FLICKER ON AND OFF in the command center. EXPLOSIONS
ROCK the interior. A WALL IS BLOWN AWAY, sending people
flying to the ground. The explosion is UNLIKE ANYTHING we've
ever seen. The wall PIXELATES INTO A HUNDRED COLORFUL BLOCKS,
leaving a HUGE OPENING, FILLED WITH SMOKY COLORFUL LIGHT.

The HANDSOME SAILOR get to his feet, runs outside.
EXT. GUAM COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 16

The SAILOR RUNS OUTSIDE, looks up to the sky. He is STUNNED
by what he sees. He is suddenly BATHED IN LIGHT. He raises
his PISTOL and begins firing upward.

Suddenly the pistol LEAVES HIS HAND and is PIXELLATED UPWARD,
INTO THE LIGHT. This is followed by the SAILOR, whose body
PIXELLATES. The PIXELS rise up... DISAPPEARING INTO THE

VIOLET
I don’t want Matty to see me.

We then hear more sobbing sounds. Brenner isn’t sure if he

Kelly. I’m coming in.

VIOLET

President Cooper is alone, reviewing a memo, when the FIRST
LADY walks in, in sweats.

FIRST LADY
I’m going to Soul Cycle to work
out, so I’1l be back in like 45
minutes, or an hour and a half if I
do a double.

She starts to leave, but he holds her up.

PRESIDENT COOPER
Babe? So Saturday, I was supposed
to have dinner with the King of
Saudi Arabia to discuss a trade
agreement, but I decided to cancel.

FIRST LADY
You did?

PRESIDENT COOPER
Well, I made a reservation at this
new place on Michigan Avenue, where
you go and actually make a cake.
You mix in the flour and eggs and
whatever, then they bake it for
you, but you get to frost it-
vanilla, chocolate, butterscotch -
then you can make a design with
sprinkles and sparkles if you want.
So I thought it could be fun if you
and I-

FIRST LADY
Sarah’s coming over Saturday. We're
gonna see a movie.

A movie. Do you think possibly you
could go to the movies with Sarah
on Sunday?

FIRST LADY

VIOLET

I thought it was just a fling, a mid-
life fling-thing, but now according to

Marrying her. My son's stepmom is gonna
be named Sinnamon.

(makes a disgusted face)
This just isn’t where I thought I’d
be at this point in my life.

BRENNER
Yeah, I’11 drink to that.

They toast with sippy cups.

VIOLET
We were high school sweethearts. The
perfect couple. He proposed in a
waterfall. An effin waterfall. We had
our problems, sure. But now I’m almost
40 and getting a divorce and he’s
marrying an 18 year old named after a
spice... and it’s not even spelled
correctly.

BRENNER

INT. SITUATION ROOM, THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY 29

The President enters. The Joint Chiefs are there, as are the
heads of the CIA, FBI and HOMELAND SECURITY. The most
intimidating by far is five-star ADMIRAL PORTER. Violet is *
one of a group seated in chairs against the wall, taking

notes. The PRESS SECRETARY walks beside Cooper as he makes

his way to the head of the table.

PRESS SECRETARY
Mr. President, we told the press that it
was an advanced weapons test that
misfired. So there’s no mass panic yet.

PRESIDENT COOPER
Good, then let’s solve this thing
before there is.

As Cooper sits, it seems like everyone starts talking at
once.

DEFENSE SECRETARY
Mr. President, clearly Pakistan's
drone technology has far surpassed
ours--—

CIA CHIEF
There’s no way we could have missed
that. This has Moscow’s
fingerprints all over it--

ADMIRAL PORTER *
Nonsense! I suspect a North Korean
black ops sideshow.

PRESIDENT COOPER
I have a theory. I think, based on
analysis of the footage, that
preliminary indications are that we
were attacked by...

CIA CHIEF
By who, sir?

Galaga.

Suddenly, there’s intimidated silence for a beat. Violet

stops taking notes. Then...

ADMIRAL PORTER
Well then let’s blow Galaga to
hell. Who’s Galaga?

JUNIOR AIDE
Um, it’s an old-timey video game 80s
kinda folks like my dad used to play.

PRESIDENT COOPER
And tell everybody what happens in
this video game, Jared.

As the Junior Aide fumbles through an answer, the SECRETARY
OF THE NAVY is talking a little too loud to the President's

Well, it’s like, alien ships Just turkey, plain turkey...

Hold on a second: Jim, are you really

I’m sorry, Mr. President. Jennifer
asked what we wanted. I figured we

grabs Ludlow by his shirt, then recognizes him...

titled “IF SHE WAS REAL...” It’s a homemade flipbook
depicting her as a bride and kissing Ludlow. As flip-book
Ludlow begins removing his shirt, Brenner puts the book down.

I hacked into the government
servers. I saw everything. Brenner,
I think I know what’s going on.

BRENNER
Oh no, here comes a theory.

LUDLOW

Look, I know I’m a bit of a conspiracy
freak. It’s cost me several promising
online relationships, most of my savings
and a month wasted looking for Walt
Disney’s head underneath an ice skating
rink in Vermont. But sometimes the
conspiracies are real. Remember when we
were kids and were in the Video Game

LUDLOW
Brenner, I spent the day on 4chan,
looking for messages from the Aliens to
prove my theory. But I came up blank. So
I decided to take a break and watch the
tape of a rerun of ONE TREE HILL that I
recorded tonight on my VCR. I’m

Ludlow points to an 80’s TV, with vintage VCR and an ANTENNA.

Because the government spies on you through
your cable boxes, Brenner! That’s been proven!

BRENNER
Oh yeah, that’s right, I forgot.
Saw that on “60 Minutes of Crazy”.

Anyway, I poured myself a bowl of sugar

of Spandau Ballet’s “TRUE” begins to play. He props it up to
record himself.

He stands facing the Girl, speaks some Hindi, then drops to
one knee. The Girl can’t believe this is happening!

Behind them, we see... something. Flashing lights, something
bright whizzing through frame too fast to see. The couple is
oblivious. The Guy speaks some more heartfelt Hindi, getting
emotional, then pulls a ring box out of his pocket.

The Girl, finally noticing what’s going on off-camera, starts
screaming. The Guy thinks she’s screaming about the ring box,
nods cockily.

for the latest military weapons.

I think maybe the extra-

Light cannons, actually. These

Violet sticks the eraser-end of a pencil into the cage and
pokes the pixel. The pencil pixellates, and the original

struggles not to drop it.

deeply regret trying to kiss you.

Cooper and Ludlow turn and look at Violet and Brenner. Violet
resumes walking; they follow.

Moving on. We've begun instructing
the Navy SEAL task force on the use
of the prototype weapons. *

She hits a button, opening the door, revealing a hangar where
a group of 50 TOUGH NAVY SEALS have gathered. They all turn
to Brenner and Ludlow with hard stares.

INT. DARPA —- HANGAR - DAY 39

Cooper, Violet, Brenner and Ludlow stand behind Admiral
Porter.

ADMIRAL PORTER
Men, you've served this nation with
distinction in combat zones in
every nook and cranny of this god-
forsaken world, defeating every
enemy they’ve thrown at you. And
now, you are going to face, and I
can’t believe I’m saying this,
aliens from outer space.

The SEALS look at each other, roll their eyes.

Brenner spots Matty in the back of the crowd (with his
bookbag), and nudges Violet.

BRENNER
What’s his security clearance?

VIOLET
I couldn't get a babysitter.

BRENNER
That's why I had to bring him.

Brenner points to Ludlow, who’s nervously rocking in his
chair.

ADMIRAL PORTER
Now these aliens, probably for
their own sick amusement, are going
to attack us in the form of “video
games”. So, to help us develop
defense strategies and counter-
tactics, the President has brought
in - and I really can’t believe I’m
saying this - these two civilian
“arcaders,” who we are now required
to listen to for 120 seconds.

Admiral Porter stalks off. Brenner and Ludlow (extremely
nervous) step forward, to a silent reaction (except for
Matty, who smiles excitedly).

LUDLOW
(whispers to Brenner)
I think I’m gonna puke.

BRENNER
Just be confident. Act the part. We
know how to do this stuff. They
don’t.

Ludlow nods, taking this to heart. They now stand in front

the surly SEALS.

BRENNER (CONT'D)
Thank you for that warm
introduction, Admiral. My name is
Sam Brenner. And this is-

Ludlow shoves Brenner out of the way.

LUDLOW
YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE! Looks to me,
Brenner, like SOMEONE FORGOT TO SEND US
THE BEST OF THE BEST and instead dropped

off a bunch of... incontinent adult-diaper-
wearing... candyass... cries-themselves-—

BRENNER

Too confident...

LUDLOW
From now on, maggots, you little... girl
Maggots, ---whatever the name for the

female form of maggots is! From now on
when you poop, WHEN YOU POOP YOUR PANTS
YOU'RE GONNA BE THINKING OF ME! So TAKE
YOUR TAMPONS OUT OF YOUR LADYBUSINESS AND
LISTEN THE EFF UP!

(yells in one Seal'’s face,

spittle flying)
Do you feel me, sailor?! DO YOU
FEEL MEEEEEEE?!?!

The SEAL is about to kill him. Matty is trying hard not to

laugh. Brenner steps in.

BRENNER
Ludlow, I think you’re gonna feel his fist
in the back of your skull if you don’t take
two steps back.

Ludlow takes two steps back, trembling. Brenner addresses the *

But we spent our childhoods training our

coordination unique to a very specific
cognitive acuity, which is meaningless in
all other areas of life, but suddenly might
come in handy for saving the planet.

(quick look to Admiral

Porter, whispers)
I learned a lot of big words at
those dorm room drug parties.

So we hope you guys can get past us being
civilian morons and let us show you a few
moves in whatever time we have.

Then...

LUDLOW
DO YOU LADIES UNDERSTAND THAT?!

BRENNER
Lud, let it go.

LUDLOW
You got it, buddy.

Ludlow nods. CUT TO:
A FAST PACED TRAINING MONTAGE/WEAPON BUILDING MONTAGE. 40
MUSIC: DRAMATIC

-Rows and rows of VINTAGE ARCADE machines have been set up. A
different NAVY SEAL stands over the controls of each video
game, as Ludlow and Brenner pace behind the SEALS stopping
every now and then to give a piece of advice. Brenner STOPS
at one machine... CENTIPEDE. He gives specific directions to
the Navy Seal, who is trying to grasp it.

Ludlow steps in to dramatically demonstrate a specific move
("keeping the wrist loose”); the SEAL stares at him angrily.

-A blueprint is on a table. Violet refers to it as she 41
barks orders to UNDERLINGS, who are making some pretty high-
tech shit.

-Brenner is playing Asteroids, and the game is being 42
displayed on a giant screen. The SEALS are sitting watching,
taking notes. It’s crazy how good Brenner is; Matty is
watching with new-found respect.

-Cooper is at the “make a cake” store with the KING OF 43
SAUDI ARABIA doing the frosting as they discuss a free-trade
agreement.

EXT. LONDON - DUSK - ESTABLISHING 44

EXT. HYDE PARK, LONDON/INT. TROOP CARRIER - NIGHT 45

HUMVEES roll down the road toward the park. Brenner and
Ludlow sit in the back, face to face with the SEALS. Ludlow
smiles at the SEALS; they don’t smile back.

EXT. HYDE PARK - NIGHT 46

They stop in a big open field, and disembark from the
Humvees. A curious SOCCER PLAYER walks over to Ludlow.

SOCCER PLAYER
What’s all this then, mate?

LUDLOW
We’re Americans! These navy guys
have gotten permission from your
government to prepare for an
extraterrestrial invasion which we
believe will occur here in the next
two hours.

The Soccer Player just stares at Ludlow. Then a British SAS
OFFICER traveling with our guys chimes in.

SAS OFFICER
We're shooting a beer commercial.

SOCCER PLAYER
Right then.

As he jogs off to rejoin his game...

Mr. Prime Minister, I can’t thank
you enough for your cooperation on

Of course, Will. The Commonwealth

The gruff SAS Officer calls out.

SAS OFFICER
Anybody who doesn’t need to be here

Brenner and Ludlow start walking away, kind of bummed.
Brenner sees Violet is shook up.

Eerily quiet, Mr. President--

It is quiet, except for a rhythmic groaning noise coming from
the walkie-talkie. It almost sounds like... sipping. BACK TO:

The Defense Secretary is nervously sipping tea in the corner.
He notices the President and everyone else staring at him.

DEFENSE SECRETARY
It’s very hot.

EXT. HYDE PARK - NIGHT 53

The park is pretty crowded. Brenner squeezes between two
metal barriers and walks over to the SAS Officer

SAS OFFICER
(grabs Brenner’s shirt)
If we need you, we know where to
find you.

Brenner turns and walks back behind the barrier.

Suddenly, there is THUNDER. LOUD THUNDER. CLOUDS have started
to materialize out of the peaceful sky. Above the clouds we
see LIGHTS. It’s very magical. And terrifying.

At the nearby soccer game, someone takes a shot on goal, and
another player deflects the ball sky-high with his head. But
then the ball doesn’t come down. Then they see why:

A SPACESHIP, MOSTLY HIDDEN BY CLOUDS HEADS TOWARDS THEM.
Brenner and the others all MARVEL at it.

THE SHIP’S PORTAL OPENS. Then THINGS START TO FALL FROM THE
CLOUDS. They look like GIANT MUSHROOMS. Everyone braces for
impact, then the giant mushrooms stop mid air. They start to
HOVER and FORM A PATTERN IN THE SKY.

BRENNER
It’s Centipede.

The SEALS “hooo-rah” and sprint off to their attack
positions. Brenner yells instructions from the other side of
the fence.

BRENNER (CONT'D)

Remember what we talked about! Kill each
centipede from the head down! If you hit
it in the middle it will break in two.

LUDLOW
Then you have two snakethings. Hit it
again, four snakethings. We do not want
four snake-things!

The cocky Seals ignore them and take aim at the night sky.

And then THEY COME. GIANT CENTIPEDES just like from the old
arcade game come to life. THE CENTIPEDES NOW EVOLVE FROM the
8 BIT look to more realistic creatures. They are TERRIFYING.

LUDLOW (CONT'D)
Oh God. Oh God. This is really real.

The GIANT CENTIPEDES SLITHER DOWN FROM THE SKY, THROUGH THE
MUSHROOMS. EACH HAS A DIFFERENT PERSONALITY. One CACKLES.
Another has A GIANT MOUTH FULL OF TEETH, constantly CHOMPING
at the air. Another GROWLS AND SCREAMS. Yet another HISSES.

Also unlike the game that existed on a solely Two Dimensional
Plane, this is REAL LIFE and THREE DIMENSIONAL. The creatures
attack from all ANGLES.

cheer goes up.

Everyone cheers. Cooper pumps his fist, psyched.

PRESIDENT COOPER
The light cannons work!

Violet looks back at Brenner and smiles gratefully. As he *
smiles back, he mutters to himself. *

G-d she’s hot... *

Then a SEAL fires up at a Centipede and hits it in the
middle. IT SPLITS IN HALF.

BRENNER (CONT'D)
NO, NO!!! DIDN’T WE JUST SAY DON’T SPLIT
THEM IN HALF?! JUST AIM FOR THE
HEAD! !...

The Seals are NOT USED to these things: the weapons or the
prey. They FIRE UP at them. But KEEP MISSING.

THE MUSHROOM-THINGS. They’re in the way!
BRENNER
SHOOT THE MUSHROOMS! It’s just like
the game. If they get down to the *

ground it’s gonna get really bad,
really quick.

The Seals FIRE UP at the mushrooms and centipedes. They hit
a mushroom which now sends a CENTIPEDE STRAIGHT DOWN TOWARDS
A SEAL. He doesn’t see it.

VIOLET
SGT. DUFF!! 12 O’CLOCK!

TOO LATE. THE CENTIPEDE CHOMPS UP SGT. DUFF AND scurries
quickly off into the bushes.

Nooooooo! It ate the Sarge! The
centipede ate the Sarge!

The remaining Seals continue to SHOOT SKYWARD. They are all
freaked out by what just happened. Another CENTIPEDE STREAKS
BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE SKY DOWN TOWARDS THEM LIKE A
VICIOUS FLYING SHARK. The Big Seal shoots at it. But it’s TOO
FAST. He KEEPS MISSING.

BRENNER
No, shoot right... Now left! Look, you
can’t just fire at where they are,
they’re too fast. You have to watch the

patterns, anticipate where they’re going
to_be and shoot there!

BIG SEAL
I DON’T KNOW THE PATTERNS!

It’s moving fast down towards them, CLOSER AND CLOSER. It’s
SCARY MOUTH BITING AWAY. Finally Brenner can’t stand it. He
leaps over the barrier, shoves the SAS Officer to the ground
and sprints toward the SEAL.

VIOLET
Brenner! No!

Brenner grabs the light cannon from the Seal and STARTS
FIRING AT THE CENTIPEDE. BLAST BLAST BLAST!

Piece by piece Brenner BLASTS it, just like in the game. And
as it dies we see it RETROGRADE BACK FROM REAL-LOOKING
CENTIPEDE TO THE LOWER RESOLUTION 8 BIT ONE FROM THE GAME,
FINALLY TO PIXELS OF ENERGY THAT DISSIPATE INTO THE AIR. The
dissipated pixels BRUSH PAST Brenner's face.

BIG SEAL

Nice shooting, civilian.

A SEAL hands his light cannon to Ludlow. Ludlow looks at
Brenner, terrified. Then...

BRENNER

LUDLOW
(takes a deep breath)
What am I worried about? I’m the
Wonder Kid.

The two of them turn skyward and start blasting away. THEY
BOTH KICK ASS.

A SCREAMING CENTIPEDE FLIES DIAGONALLY DOWN FOR LUDLOW.
LUDLOW BLASTS IT. IT BREAKS IN TWO RIGHT BEFORE it hits him.
The two pieces HIT THE GROUND and SLITHER AWAY. But LUDLOW
quickly nails them both with a cool spin move.

A HOPPING SPIDER APPEARS, AND BEGINS HOPPING SUPER-FAST
TOWARD ADMIRAL PORTER. ADMIRAL PORTER, TERRIFIED, LETS OUT A
HIGH-PITCHED SCREAM.

BRENNER TAKES AIM (THE GUN BARREL TILTING UP AND DOWN AS HE
TRACKS THE HOPS). HE FIRES AND NAILS THE SPIDER IN THE NICK

shooting crazily into the sky.

An OLD WOMAN is exercising along with a “BUNS OF STEEL”, an
English workout TV show. THE CENTIPEDE BUSTS THROUGH THE DOOR

her workout. The Centipede TURNS BACK and STOPS beside the
woman. The creature is mesmerized by the TV show, by the
music... The Centipede MIMICS the movements of the workout,
beginning to exercise along with her...

Time slows down. Brenner, pissed off, appears at the window
and TAKES AIM. THE CENTIPEDE OPENS ITS MOUTH. ONLY A FEW FEET
FROM THE BOY.

In SLO MO BRENNER FIRES! BLAST BLAST BLAST! The tail end is
hit and disappears again and again, the Centipede getting
shorter and shorter til it’s just the head, opening it’s
mouth to eat the boy... THE LAST BLAST HITS IT. The centipede
DE-RESES AND PIXELATES INTO NOTHING.

PRESIDENT COOPER
He’s going to mess this up. He’s
going to screw us over.

They look back at Eddie, who’s blowing kisses at Violet.

BRENNER
He’s no day at the beach. But I think
a lot of this is just a front. We’re
giving him the chance to be a hero.
Even assholes like him want to be a
hero.

PRESIDENT COOPER
I don’t know, man...

BRENNER
You gotta trust me.

Cooper thinks for a beat, then walks back to the table.

PRESIDENT COOPER
1) You're not getting a helicopter or any
sort of flying or driving vehicle. 2) I
think the Federal Government can probably
do without your income taxes and be okay.
But sales tax you’re on your own. And 3)
IF you help us beat these things... I
think we can get you out of here.

EDDIE PLANT
-.-And the Swift/Lee Curtis

PRESIDENT COOPER
Pick one of them.

We'll see if we can set up... a coffee.

Ludlow can’t believe it.

The guys are wearing DARK BLUE “ARCADER” SUITS. Eddie has a

GPS BRACELET on his ankle.

EDDIE PLANT
Hello Big Apple, the cavalry has

The POLICE COMMISSIONER walks over.

POLICE COMMISSIONER
Thanks for coming. We saw how you

you can do the same for us.

BRENNER
I hope so too. So what are we

The Commissioner calls over a ROOKIE COP. He is draped in a

blanket, shaken up.

POLICE COMMISSIONER
Rookie! Tell ‘em what you saw.

The Rookie Cop comes over, his eyes saucers of fear.

ROOKIE COP
It... it came out of the clouds.
And then it started attacking.
Devouring everything in it’s path.
It was awful! It was like a scene

EDDIE PLANT
Okay. So where do we get us some ghosts?

CUT TO:
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY 72

On the street we see FOUR MINI COOPERS -- Each of them
painted a color like the GHOSTS from Pacman.

Violet points to a high tech METAL CONTRAPTION ATTACHED TO
THE ROOF OF EACH OF THE MINI COOPERS.

VIOLET
We used the energy force field technology
from the cube to develop 4 mini
generators for each of the cars/"Ghosts.”
We’re calling them 2950 Attack Modules.

BRENNER
And we're calling ‘em “Ghost Coopers.”
But there’s four of them, and only
three of us. Who’s our fourth?

An older Japanese man, TORU IWATANI, steps forward. He is
wearing a jumpsuit like Brenner, Ludlow and Eddie.

Iwatani... the inventor of Pac Man.

EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS — NIGHT 76

The Ghostcoopers roll into the city. We see PEOPLE FLEEING.
DESTRUCTION. It’s like a scene out of a Godzilla movie.

We hear the FAMILIAR SOUND OF PACMAN MOVING, EATING, but now
on a grander scale. They HEAD towards the noise. It’s getting
LOUDER AND LOUDER.

They round the corner and see THE PACMAN. He is like a giant
yellow, three dimensional version of the one from the game.
CROWDS OF PEOPLE flee from him. The slower ones are DEVOURED
by Pacman, along with abandoned cars, motorcycles...

EDDIE PLANT
Look at the size of that thing! It looks
like Barry Bonds’ head!

BRENNER
I can’t believe Pac-Man’s a bad guy.

Prof. Iwatani is near tears, stunned by what he sees.

PROF. IWATANI
Pac-Man is not bad! I created him
to bring joy to all the people of

him! Deep down, he is gentle, kind,

Pac-Man OPENS HIS MOUTH and CHOMPS OFF Prof. Iwatani’s hand.
He SCREAMS, as the top of his wrist PIXELATES AWAY.

Aaaaaah! Kill this stupid

Prof. Iwatani turns and RUNS AWAY, DISAPPEARING DOWN the

Pacman GLARES at Brenner. They stare at each other for a

THE THREE REMAINING GHOST-COOPERS HAUL ASS and TAKE OFF AFTER
PACMAN.

Violet looks at the SATELLITE FOOTAGE AND MAPS OF THE

PACMAN EATS IT. He STARTS TO GLOW AND SHAKE.

SCREAMING LUDLOW VEERS RIGHT. BRENNER SHIFTS INTO REVERSE AND
FLOORS IT. POWERED UP PACMAN HEADS AFTER HIM.

EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - CONTINUOUS 88

Brenner still flooring it in reverse as Pacman chases him
with a vengeance like the T-Rex in Jurassic Park.

BRENNER
A power pill! He’s got ten seconds
where he can eat us.

Brenner then makes a HARD TURN. He looks and Pacman is GONE.
EXT. MANHATTAN STREETS/VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS 89

Ludlow stops. Looks around. He doesn’t see him anywhere. He
is breathing heavily, hyper-ventilating. Then in his REAR
VIEW WE SEE PACMAN QUICKLY COMING TOWARDS HIM FROM BEHIND.

Ludlow HITS the gas. Pacman CHASES HIM, he’s FASTER than
Ludlow and QUICKLY CATCHES UP to the Ghost-Cooper. Pacman
opens his mouth and... BITES OFF THE BACK HATCH of Ludlow ‘s
car. Leaving a GAPING HOLE. LUDLOW, EYES WIDE, SCREAMS!

Freaked out Ludlow FLOORS THE GAS. But Pacman is still
CHASING HIM, STILL CHOMPING.

Pacman TAKES ANOTHER BITE and gobbles up the ENTIRE REAR
SECTION of the car. Ludlow is literally driving on TWO
WHEELS. His seat the only thing separating him from Pacman,
who is still in HOT PURSUIT. Only a FEW INCHES from gobbling
up Ludlow. He tries to jump, but his seatbelt is JAMMED! He
emits a girlish scream, keeps pulling on his seat belt.

About to be Pac-food, Ludlow HITS THE BRAKES, causing the car
to SPIN around, facing Pacman, whose mouth OPENS WIDE...

THE SEATBELT FINALLY BREAKS FREE AND LUDLOW LEAPS OUT OF THE
OPEN BACK OF HIS VEHICLE RIGHT AS PACMAN EATS IT!

Again we hear the DEAFENING GHOST-EATING SOUND. Then
Pacman’s power boost finally runs out.

Ludlow lies on the ground, defenseless without his

In the background, Q-Bert bounces so high his head gets
caught in the ceiling. He makes his funny “game over” sound.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT 112

A huge gala. A swing band plays a jaunty tune. But then the
band stops, mid-song, and quickly begins playing “Hail to the
Chief”. The President has arrived.

He is accompanied by Brenner and the First Lady; all are
enthusiastically applauded.

BRENNER
I wish they played my theme song
every time I walked into a party.

PRESIDENT COOPER
That would be cool, but most
orchestras don’t know “The Safety
Dance”.

Glad to see Ludlow and his mom made
it.

CUT TO Ludlow and HIS MOM at the buffet table. She’s sneaking
chicken tenders into her purse.

LUDLOW
Mom, everyone can see you doing
that!

LUDLOW'S MOM
Oh, come on, Luddie. What’s the

FIRST LADY
I’m dying to meet Sam’s new love
interest. Is she pretty, Will?

PRESIDENT COOPER
Uh, define “pretty”. I mean, you're
pretty, extremely pretty, and
she’s, I mean, in a sense,
certainly for a military--
(looks up, sees something)
She's a ten.

What he sees is Violet walking in, in her full dress uniform.
She looks amazing. She’s holding hand with Matty, who’s in a
tux.

MATTY
Q-Bert!

Matty sees Q-Bert, also in a tux (with a bandage on his
head), getting down on the dance floor, and runs to play with
him. Brenner walks over to Violet, and salutes.

VIOLET
Hi. You look nice.

BRENNER
Thanks. I know we’re on duty, and
could get the call at any time, but
Chewie says I’m allowed have half a
beer. Want to split one with me?

VIOLET
Lead the way.

As Brenner and Violet walk off, we see Eddie Plant walk in
with JAMIE LEE CURTIS. A burly SECRET SERVICE AGENT stands
between them.

EDDIE PLANT
Well looky here, a big party to
thank me for saving the world! And
you get to stand next to me all

So what’s this Sinnamon look like?

VIOLET
What do you mean? She’s a husband-

BRENNER
Not that hot though, right? Girls like
that, who go with older guys, always
have one thing wrong with them, like big
nostrils or a huge forehead or something.

VIOLET
No, Sinnamon is pretty much perfect...
except her eyes are too far apart. She
kind of looks like a flounder.

BRENNER
Boom, there it is. Tonight, he’s gonna
be looking into those eyes, thinking,
“What happened? I used to look into
the most gorgeous eyes in the world,
now I’m stuck with Goggle-Eyes McGee.”

VIOLET
Did you just say I had gorgeous eyes?

BRENNER
While insulting the other chick.

VIOLET
Oh, you’re good.

BACK NEAR THE DANCE FLOOR, Cooper is watching his wife

dance with Ludlow (eyes closed, head resting on her
shoulder), when Ludlow’s Mom walks over.

LUDLOW’S MOM
I don’t mean to bother you, Mr.

That you’re a great guy. Anda

BRENNER

an announcement.

PRESIDENT COOPER
Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to

Arcaders from the students of PS

Large TV screens surrounding the party flicker to life. They
display images of smiling SCHOOLKIDS, dressed in mini-Arcader
outfits. *

SCHOOLKIDS
New York was in trouble,
Pac Man caused a ruckus,
But the Arcaders saved us,
Cause they’re bad mother--

But the images flicker and distort into 80’s era DARYL HALL

DARYL HALL (ON TV)
People of earth: you have violated
the rules of warfare. Because of
this, you forfeit and your planet
is now (STATIC) ours.

PRESIDENT COOPER
“Violated the rules?” What the hell
does that mean?

Eddie nervously gulps his drink.

JAMIE LEE CURTIS

As Jamie Lee grabs a bottle of Jim Beam off the bar, and
starts chugging, Eddie is quietly backing away.

Cooper, Violet, Admiral Porter and others huddle together to
discuss the invasion.

PRESIDENT COOPER
How many light cannons do we
currently have?

ADMIRAL PORTER
I think we need to forget the light

EXT. WASHINGTON DC STREET - DAY 116

WIDE SHOT - The MOTHERSHIP comes out of the clouds. We SEE IT
FULLY FOR THE FIRST TIME. It’s the ship from GALAGA.

The PORTAL OPENS. ARCADE CHARACTERS COME TO LIFE, POUR OUT.
It’s an ALL STAR VERSION OF VARIOUS ARCADE GAMES FROM THE
EIGHTIES. But this time they aren’t here to play games, but
to BRING ABOUT OUR DESTRUCTION. JOUST characters surround the
Washington Monument and start to destroy it.

PAN DOWN to see Brenner, Ludlow, Violet and Q-Bert on the
street. MOVING FAST. They are all in Arcader suits, but
without weapons. They seem intimidated (especially Ludlow),
but are running toward the mothership (as the few people
still around run the other way).

Everywhere around them, cars are OVERTURNED, CRASHED and
PIXELATED. SECTIONS of the street EXPLODE behind them.

LUDLOW
Are you sure we need to do this? I
mean, maybe we can just find
another planet to live on. I heard
there’s a secret city on Mars where
rich people are gonna live when
there’s a nuclear war. They have
greenhouses there, and zero-gravity
gyms, and free HBO...

Suddenly, they STOP. Seeing SOMETHING AHEAD. A FROGGER. LEAPING
TOWARD THEM.

THEY RUN THE OTHER WAY, BUT THE FROGGER IS TOO FAST.

LUDLOW (CONT'D)
This is it!

Just when they’re about to be pounced on, a crane scoop
descends from the sky. It scoops up the Frogger in its jaws,
and lifts it in the air, suspending it so it can do no harm.

Brenner, Ludlow and Violet eyeball the crane, following the
steel cable to the arm to the cab, where a man in a suit and a
Chewbacca mask opens the door and emerges.

He takes off the mask. It’s COOPER.

CLOUDS OF PIXELATED SMOKE.

They round the corner and see..

THE MASSIVE MOTHERSHIP, HOVERING almost directly above 122
them.

Suddenly, with a deafening rattle, the portal OPENS. The BEAM
SHOOTS OUT. Violet is grimly determined, but Brenner and
Cooper exchange TERRIFIED glances.

Brenner sticks his arm into the beam. It depixelates, and the
cubes fly up toward the mothership. The one-armed Brenner
winks at Violet, then steps all the way in, instantly de-
pixelating. Violet follows. Cooper looks at Q-Bert,
terrified.

CLOSER, FASTER.

WE SEE TWO GIANT FEET, STOMPING on the top platform. Suddenly,
the scaffolding SHIFTS, as if hit by a massive earthquake. It
RE-ARRANGES into the DIAGONAL VERSION of the game.

Brenner looks up. At the top of the scaffolding, peering over
the edge, stepping out of the shadows, is a giant character:

BRENNER
Donkey Kong.

DONKEY KONG is big and come to life. He pounds his chest.

She's pointing to a cell way at the top, behind Donkey Kong.
Matty, the Indian Kid and the Handsome Sailor are inside.

Donkey Kong starts TOSSING BARRELS down the ramps. There is

no_room for them to avoid them if they want to get to the
top. THIS SHOULD LOOK JUST LIKE THE GAME COME TO LIFE.

PRESIDENT COOPER
I mean, it’s just a barrel! How bad
could it hurt?

With that ANOTHER BARREL comes SMASHING DOWN. IT LEAVES A

There’s only one thing we can do...

They JUMP the first barrel, and the second... but there are

OTHERS.

They run to the ladder. Brenner watches a barrel roll over
head on the ramp above.

Brenner is the first up the ladder. He runs to the NEXT

hammer DE-PIXELATES in his hands. He looks up at Donkey Kong,
calculating... looks back to the others.

nearly FALLS, but regains his balance.

Brenner CLIMBS to the next level, followed by Cooper and

He runs screaming then leaps into Cooper’s arms, terrified.
But now Violet is TRAPPED. The FIRE APPROACHES HER FROM BOTH
SIDES!

She LEAPS UP to get away from the pixelated flames. She HANGS
ON to the platform of the upper level. Her feet are INCHES
AWAY from being touched by the flames.

Donkey Kong sees that Violet is in jeopardy, and he STARTS TO
THROW BARRELS TOWARD HER!

Brenner RUNS FORWARD and DIVES beneath the stomping feet of
Donkey Kong. He LEAPS DOWN to the lower level and GRABS A
HAMMER.

Brenner SMASHES barrel after barrel, trying to rescue Violet.
With the coast clear, for a moment, Brenner arrives at Violet
and LOWERS the hammer to her.

BRENNER
(smiling)
Grab my mighty hammer!

VIOLET
You loved saying that.

BRENNER
Yes I did.

Violet GRABS the hammer and holds on as Brenner LIFTS HER TO
SAFETY.

Brenner DESTROYS a few more barrels before turning and
THROWING THE HAMMER up to the top level, toward Donkey Kong.

The spinning hammer HITS Donkey Kong. For a moment, Donkey
Kong is stunned, a little hurt, suddenly weakened.

Cooper and Q-Bert CHEER. Brenner and Violet make it to the
top level. Brenner, TOUGH, HARD, turns to Donkey Kong.

BRENNER (CONT'D)
Game over.

Donkey Kong ROARS. Followed by a sad, DISAPPOINTED look on
his face. We hear the MASSIVE SOUND OF VICTORY! And suddenly,
Donkey Kong DE-PIXELATES, along with the rest of the set.
CRUMBLING into the darkness below.

Matty and Violet embrace. The Sailor salutes Cooper, and then
they embrace. Brenner is not sure what to do; the Indian
Teenager extends his arms, and they hug.

INDIAN TEEN
“Game over”, that was a good one...

BRENNER
Thanks, it was all I could come up
with...

Cooper looks down at a shaken Q-Bert.

PRESIDENT COOPER
You okay, buddy?

Q-BERT
I---need---a---driiiink.

BRENNER
All right, Q-ball, take us to the

Zorex!
They all turn, a LADDER APPEARS. Leading upward...
EXT. WASHINGTON DC STREET - DAY 126

Ludlow is still SWORDFIGHTING Lady Lisa. Finally he throws
down his sword and DROPS TO HIS KNEES.

LUDLOW
I won’t fight you anymore. I know
you have love in your heart and I
know that I could make you happy.
But if you need to kill me, then
kill me. I‘'11 die a happy man,
knowing that I found true love.

He closes his eyes and waits. She stares at him. CONFUSED.
Ludlow looks up at her. Their EYES MEET. Ludlow stands. She
LOWERS her sword. Ludlow STEPS toward her, EMBRACES her, and
they... KISS. It is a long, PASSIONATE kiss.

EDDIE PLANT (0.C.)
And I couldn’t even get a handshake
offa Sigourney Weaver!

Ludlow LOOKS UP to see EDDIE PLANT standing there.

LUDLOW
Didn't think we'd ever see you
again.

EDDIE PLANT
I caused this, I gotta help make it
right.
(a beat)
Can a brother get a gun, please?

Ludlow tosses Eddie one of his light cannons. Eddie BLASTS
two nearby OSTRICHS from JOUST who are chasing a lady with a
stroller.

INT. MOTHERSHIP, ENERGY GENERATOR ROOM - DAY

93.

The door opens. In the center is the ZOREX. It’s the exact

same shape and size of an OLD SCHOOL ARCADE GAME. Countless

wires extend from the console, attached to energy devices in
the walls and a POD which spits out the ENERGY CREATURES. It
spits out A SMURF. He seems so excited to be alive. He takes
a breath, then BLAST. Cooper shoots him. He de-res’s. A look
of anger on his face as he pixelates and his short life ends.

PRESIDENT COOPER
When we were kids, did you ever
think that someday we would
actually be in a spaceship,
shooting an actual laser gun while
trying to save the world?

BRENNER/INDIAN TEEN/SAILOR
Yes...Totally...Every day...

FAMILIAR KID’S VOICE
Hey, Brenner.

Brenner turns, AIMS his gun. His jaw drops.

We see that the ALIENS’S FINAL GUISE IS YOUNG BRENNER, YOUNG
LUDLOW, YOUNG COOPER AND YOUNG EDDIE from the film’s opening.

ALIEN KID BRENNER
We come to you in these forms out
of respect for you and the other
champions who have beaten us today.

BRENNER
Stay back or we’1l blow up this
ship and all of you with it. I
don’t care if you're me.

ALIEN KID COOPER
There will be no need for that,
Sam. We admit you have won.

ALIEN KID LUDLOW
Because of your victory you can now
destroy our planet.

The three all bow their heads in sadness.

PRESIDENT COOPER
Wait, we don’t want to destroy your
planet. We never did.

ALIEN KID LUDLOW
(confused)
Then why did you send us that
declaration of war, Chewie?

PRESIDENT COOPER
That wasn’t a declaration of war!
They were just games. Games that we
played for fun. We don’t want to hurt
anybody.

The Aliens seem thrown by this. They don’t understand.

LUDLOW (OVER THE WALKIE)
BRENNER! BRENNER!!!

BRENNER
Lud, a little busy right now.

LUDLOW (0.S.)
Um, things aren't going so well
down here, Sam!

EXT. DC STREET - CONTINUOUS - DAY 128

Eddie, Ludlow and Lady Lisa are being CONFRONTED BY SEVERAL
ARCADE GAME CREATURES coming down from the sky. Eddie fires
back at them as he goes.

EDDIE PLANT
TELL HIM WHATEVER HE’S DOING TO
HURRY THE EFF UP!

INT. ENERGY ROOM, MOTHERSHIP - CONTINUOUS 129
(Intercutting with Eddie on DC Streets)

ALIEN KID BRENNER
So you don’t want to destroy us?

PRESIDENT COOPER
No. And we definitely don’t want you to
destroy us.
(The Aliens take this in.)
In fact I’d like to broker a peace
between our two worlds so we can both
live together in harmony.

Q-BERT
(autotuned)

Harmonyyyyyy..-

EDDIE PLANT
BRENNER, WE ARE ABOUT TO DIE
VIOLENTLY, STOP DICKING AROUND AND-

ALIEN KID EDDIE
Calm down, Eddie!

EDDIE PLANT
Who was that? Was that me? That
sounded like me!

The three Alien kids laugh.
BRENNER
Hey guys... If we’re doing this peace thing
do you think you could turn off the Zorex?

ALIEN KID BRENNER
Word up.

Alien Kid Brenner goes behind the Zorex and unplugs it.

EXT. DC STREET - CONTINUOUS - DAY 130
The ARCADE CREATURES CLOSE IN on our Guys and Lady Lisa, who
continue to fight. But it’s a LOSING BATTLE. As the creatures
MOVE IN FOR THE KILL...

THEY BEGIN TO DE-RES. PIXELATE. And DISAPPEAR.

Ludlow turns, and Lady Lisa PIXELATES and DE-RESES before his
very eyes!

EDDIE PLANT
We won. NO MORE TAXES!

But Ludlow is CRUSHED.

LUDLOW
Lady Lisaaaaaaaaa!!

EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - DAY 131

A jumble of multi-colored pixels drops out of the mothership
onto the White House lawn. As they land, they re-pixelate
into Brenner, Cooper, Violet, Matty, Q-Bert, the Indian kid
and the Sailor. PEOPLE on the ground have gathered to cheer
them. The First Lady runs over to Cooper and embraces him.

FIRST LADY
I canceled with Sarah this weekend.
We can frost as many cakes as you
want.

Eddie walks over.

EDDIE PLANT
I can’t believe I did it! I mean,
we did it! I mean, you did it!

BRENNER
Eddie? Didn’t think I’d ever see
you again.

EDDIE PLANT
Look, I just wanted to say I’m
sorry I cheated back when we were
kids, and also for cheating again
more recently. I don’t have to go
back to prison, do I?

PRESIDENT COOPER
No. But you do have to admit to
Brenner he’s the best in the world.

EDDIE PLANT
No!

He reconsiders, then turns to Brenner.
EDDIE PLANT (CONT'D)
Brenner... you... you’re the best.
In the world.

BRENNER
Suck it.

Brenner hugs him. Everyone looks happy - except for Ludlow.

PRESIDENT COOPER
Ludlow, what’s wrong buddy?

LUDLOW
You all got what you wanted.
Brenner, you got the girl; Eddie

got out of jail and me... For one
moment I had the one thing I always
wanted and now... she’s gone.

Cooper, confused, turns to Eddie, who explains.

EDDIE PLANT
Lady Lisa. When you guys saved the
world... You kinda’ destroyed his.

BRENNER
Sorry about that, Lud. But ya’
know, we had to do what was best
for the other 7 or so billion
people out there.

Ludlow nods, sadly, notices Q-Bert.

LUDLOW
So how come he’s still alive?

VIOLET
Q-Bert’s a trophy. I guess we get
to keep trophies.

Ludlow nods. Dejected. Then Q-bert starts jumping up and down
excitedly. He RE-PIXELATES INTO...

LADY LISA.

Ludlow runs and kisses her. Everybody is touched, except
Brenner.

BRENNER
No one else is weirded out right now?

A group of PRESS PEOPLE run across the lawn toward them.

PRESS PERSON
Mr. President, are we out of danger?

PRESIDENT COOPER
Yes. In fact, I am pleased to announce
that I have brokered a peace treaty with
the Alien Invaders.

INT. MATTY’S DAD’S HOUSE - DAY 132

PRESIDENT COOPER (ON THE TV)
This peace was due to and only due
to the bravery of the Arcaders, who
against all odds stepped up and
saved us all.

INT. ADMIRAL PORTERS’S OFFICE - DAY 133
Admiral Porter, unshaven and in sweats, sneers at the TV.
PRESIDENT COOPER (ON THE TV)
They faced the doubters and the
naysayers, and came up big when we
needed them most.
Admiral Porter flips the bird at the TV.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - DAY 134

Brenner, Eddie, Ludlow, Violet and Matty are watching Cooper
finish his speech.

PRESIDENT COOPER
Sam Brenner, Ludlow Lamonsoff and
Eddie Plant are American heroes.
World heroes.

The assembled press cheers. Violet turns to Brenner.

VIOLET
“World hero?” I guess you’re never
gonna’ finish installing my home
theater system now.

BRENNER
I might be able to fit you ina
week from Tuesday.
VIOLET

Can’t you do it any sooner? I'11l

make it worth your while...
Violet and Brenner kiss. CAMERA CRANES BACK, as Cooper and
all of them are congratulated by the celebratory crowd,
swarming them, thanking them.
Eddie, standing off by himself, away from the others, a
lonely moment... He turns, starts to exit. His phone BUZZES.
Eddie glances to the text:
Hey, Hero. Meet me in the Lincoln Bedroom.
Eddie looks to the White House.
INT. LINCOLN BEDROOM WINDOW - DAY 135
Standing in a second floor window, dressed in a negligee, lit
by candlelight, is Jamie Lee Curtis. She gives a flirty wave,
a sexy smile, to Eddie.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN - DAY 136
Eddie smiles, touched, a bit excited. He moves forward,
toward the White House. A hand stops him in his tracks. Eddie
looks up.
It’s TAYLOR SWIFT. Standing directly in front of him.

TAYLOR SWIFT
Where do you think you’re going?

Taylor Swift plants a long, intense, passionate KISS on
Eddie’s lips.
