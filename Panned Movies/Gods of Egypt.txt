1/20/12OVER BLACK:
We hear the voice of THOTH. A voice that knows all things:
THOTH’S VOICE
Listen, if thou wouldst be wise.
Weigh my words and hear their truth
-- though I’ve ceased being
surprised by the inability of some
to listen when wisdom speaks.
The RISING SUN crests the PEAK OF A PYRAMID. Not an ancient
ruin. It’s BRAND NEW, smooth as glass.
THOTH’S VOICE
Egypt was not always as you know it
now, dry and unforgiving.
PULL BACK to reveal towering FORESTS that stretch to the
horizon. The air is lush with the breath of life. This
Egypt is Edenic, primordial -- with no sand to be seen.
THOTH’S VOICE
Before history began, Egypt was a
paradise worthy of the gods who
created it. So the gods decided to
live there themselves amongst their
other, lesser creation... Men.
The Pyramid is just a small part of a glittering PALACE
COMPLEX.
THOTH’S VOICE
Egypt was divided between two
mighty brothers...
EXT. GREAT PALACE ON THE NILE - DAY
What looks like a handsome MAN walks along the shore of the
NILE RIVER, its surface sparkling in the sun. He is
OSIRIS
The God of Nature and Life. 40s. (The ages of gods are how
old they appear -- many are ancient.) He wears a simple
crown. His immense power belied by a gentle, open demeanor.
THOTH’S VOICE
The god Osiris had dominion over
the lands made bountiful by the
Nile. The power of its waters
flowed through him. And so he
could make life.
(CONTINUED)2.
CONTINUED:
LOTUS FLOWERS magically BLOOM as Osiris passes, sprouting
from his footprints on the silty shore in a ribbon of life.
EXT. RED DESERT - DAY
DESERT the color of blood lurks beyond the lush green land.
Here stands another PYRAMID, made entirely of SAND... its
surface in constant motion... held together by magic.
THOTH’S VOICE
Osiris’ brother Set ruled the far
Desert, where nothing can grow. He
drew vast power from the fire that
burned at the center of the world.
INT. TEMPLE OF SET - DAY
SET
Stands over a FIERY PIT IN THE EARTH, drawing sustenance from
its molten depths. 40s. The God of the Desert. Physically
powerful, yet cunning.
THOTH’S VOICE
But despite his power, Set was
eternally jealous of his brother...
because Osiris could give life --
and he could not.
Set is joined by a fearsome cabal of GODS and MEN...
THOTH’S VOICE
His jealousy corrupted him.
Blessed with great cleverness, Set
sowed confusion in others. Blessed
with great strength, he exploited
their weaknesses.
(beat)
And so the wicked were drawn to
Set.
EXT. VILLAGE - DAY
VILLAGERS watch Osiris expectantly... as he plants SEEDS and
waters them... Vibrant GRAIN SEEDLINGS magically SPROUT...
THOTH’S VOICE
Osiris shared his gifts with Men,
teaching them to plant and harvest.
To make laws and live in peace. In
return, Men loved their king.
Thankful Villagers bow before Osiris. A sudden WIND blows...
(CONTINUED)3.
CONTINUED:
HORUS
30s, bronzed skin, his form and features are perfection. He
ENTERS boldly with a slain lion draped over his shoulder, the
spoils of his hunt... clutching a jug of wine in his other
hand. He leads a ROWDY band of GODS in celebration...
THOTH’S VOICE
Osiris had a son, Horus, who was
Lord of the Air.
(beat)
Osiris wished his son would rule at
his side...
Horus, full of wine, inadvertently tramples the seedlings his
father planted.
THOTH’S VOICE
...but like the wind, Horus was
restless and volatile.
ON OSIRIS. Disappointment. He kneels to restore the
seedlings his son crushed without even noticing...
EXT. OSIRIS’ GARDEN - NIGHT
Osiris WALKS in his garden, enjoying the night with his wife,
the Queen:
ISIS
40s. She radiates power, commanding respect, a goddess above
all other goddesses. Uncompromising in all things --
especially her unyielding love for her husband.
THOTH’S VOICE
After eons of enmity, Set visited
his brother.
A strange and disturbing BEAST DARTS from tree to tree behind
Osiris... It’s like a jackal -- but bigger. A curved snout
filled with fangs, square ears, forked tail, and canine body.
BEHIND Osiris, the beast TRANSFORMS INTO SET. His KNIFE
flashes in the darkness...
THOTH’S VOICE
If Set could not give life, he
would take it.
Set STABS Osiris in the back.
Isis wails as Osiris DIES in her arms.
(CONTINUED)4.
CONTINUED:
Set places the crown on his head as his CONSPIRATORS surround
Osiris’ body...
THOTH’S VOICE
That night, Set cut Osiris’ body
into fourteen pieces. The heart
was never found.
BLOOD RED BANNERS are raised high... They depict a stylized
profile of the beast with a long snout and tall ears. The
symbol of Set.
The GODS OF OSIRIS’ COURT huddle, cowed in terror.
THOTH’S VOICE
Gods bowed to Set or fled. Men
worshipped him or were enslaved.
Over the sound of Isis’ lamentation, WE PUSH IN ON the banner
of Set... Until RED FILLS THE FRAME.
EXT. TOMB OF OSIRIS
Horus kneels at his father’s sarcophagus, grieving... The
sound of his mother’s sorrow still lingers, ever-present...
THOTH’S VOICE
Horus did not know how much he
loved his father until it was too
late.
EXT. A LONELY MOUNTAINTOP - DAY
The sound of Isis’ crying becomes the WHISTLING WIND...
THOTH’S VOICE
Years passed.
HORUS’ HAND grips a banner of Set...
THOTH’S VOICE
Those that loved Osiris prayed for
his son to return.
His hand releases the banner... The wind sucks it away...
Toward a distant MOUNTAIN PEAK... The cloth getting smaller
and smaller until it’s just a red speck...
THOTH’S VOICE
They thought Horus would save them.
They thought he would be a wise and
just king, like his father.
(CONTINUED)5.
CONTINUED:
BACKLIT against the sun, Horus pulls a SPEAR from a line of
spears stuck upright in the ground. His EYES flare,
unnaturally bright. Like twin stars, burning as they aim...
THOTH’S VOICE
But Horus’ Eyes -- eyes that can
see everything -- have been focused
on only one thing.
Horus’ muscled arm cocks back and HURLS the spear... The
force parts the air in a SONIC BOOM --
THOTH’S VOICE
Vengeance.
WE FOLLOW THE SPEAR... Like a missile, it SAILS FOR MILES.
A blur over forested landscape -- PINNING the BANNER OF SET
to a FAR CLIFF. Bulls-eye.
ON HORUS. We finally see his face. There is no satisfaction
from the feat, only relentless concentration.
Horus reaches for another spear -- surprisingly GRABS ONLY
AIR...
WEPWAWET
It would be good day to kill him,
wouldn't it? Very poetic...
WEPWAWET
Twirls the spear -- swiped from under Horus’ nose. The God
of Stealth and Horus’ fiercely loyal friend and mentor. Late
30s, gray-haired. Squat as a barrel yet quick as a shadow.
WEPWAWET
I hear Set’s celebrating the
anniversary of your father’s death
with a big festival... Music,
dancing. A grand time.
ON HORUS. It’s no secret. Horus snatches back his spear...
HORUS
I’m ready.
WEPWAWET
You think so?
HORUS
If I’m not, you’ve been wasting the
last ten years.
(CONTINUED)6.
CONTINUED: (2)
WEPWAWET
(off the spear)
I taught you to throw it straight
enough.
(prodding)
And every time you do, I suppose
you picture Set cutting up your
father’s body while he forced your
mother to watch.
Horus’ anger flares. Why is Wepwawet provoking Horus?
WEPWAWET
But of course you didn't actually
see it, did you? You weren't there
at all. You were off wandering the
earth, being a child. When your
father needed a man.
The foliage near Horus BURSTS INTO FLAME. We see when Horus
gets angry, his body literally RADIATES HEAT.
HORUS
You know I loved him. I should run
you through...
WEPWAWET
(points at the far cliff)
Too easy. Hit the target instead.
Horus THROWS his spear again... As he does so, his head
CHANGES, for a split second, into that of a FALCON --
His spear MISSES the banner he hit before. Instead, it
shears off the side of the far cliff, causing an AVALANCHE.
A beat of silence between them. It’s clear what the lesson
is. Even if the student doesn't want to accept it.
WEPWAWET
If you fight Set in anger, you’ll
lose.
HORUS
The anger will never leave. And I
can’t wait that long.
Wepwawet slaps Horus on the back, trying to lighten the mood.
WEPWAWET
Let this day come and go.
Finally Horus nods, agreeing...
(CONTINUED)7.
CONTINUED: (3)
Horus THROWS his last spear with all his might... As if that
could purge years of pent-up grief.
UP IN THE STRATOSPHERE
The SONIC BOOM creates a powerful WINDSTORM...
THOTH’S VOICE
But this is not just a story of
Horus’ quest for revenge -- the
fate of all Egypt hung in the
balance...
FOLLOW THE WIND across Egypt... over FIELDS and FORESTS...
THOTH’S VOICE
Even the fate of overlooked,
unappreciated Man.
(beat)
One in particular. Not even I
could have imagined he’d help save
the immortal land of the gods...
CUT TO:
CLOSE ON A YOUNG MAN, passionately kissing a YOUNG WOMAN...
BEK
Early 20s. Wiry build. Sharp good looks. A devil-may-care
glint in his eye.
ZAYA
Also early 20s. She’s beautiful by any measure, with emerald
green eyes. Steadfast in her beliefs.
We’re too close to see exactly where they are -- but they
recline on luxurious pillows...
Bek playfully shows Zaya a bottle of PERFUMED OIL...
BEK
(off the oil)
Real Mendesian.
She’s impressed. Bek opens the back of her dress, exposing
the skin. He kneads the oil into tired muscles...
ZAYA
Yes... Higher... That’s it...
(eyes closed, off the oil)
Who did you steal it from?
(CONTINUED)8.
CONTINUED:
BEK
An outrageous suggestion.
ZAYA
How about the money to buy it?
BEK
(shrugs)
Less outrageous.
This is not a thing Zaya approves of, but she’s not judging.
ZAYA
In a different world you’d find an
honest trade, right?
BEK
In a different world, absolutely.
ON BEK. But in this world, not a chance in hell.
Bek pulls her on top of him... She squeals, delighted, then
covers her mouth. Was she too loud?
We REVEAL Bek and Zaya are in a RICHLY APPOINTED OFFICE. The
pillows arranged in a makeshift bed on the floor... We
realize there’s something illicit going on here.
BEK
You know we can’t go on like this.
It’s too dangerous for you.
ZAYA
(kisses him)
It’s worth it.
A GUST OF WIND batters the blinds. They both jump, startled.
BEK
Wind came out of nowhere...
ZAYA
Nothing in Egypt comes from
nowhere.
(beat)
It’s Horus. He’s coming to end all
this.
We SEE the view out the window:
A MULTITUDE of men and women toiling... SLAVES. A vast,
pitiful tableau of tears, sweat and blood. All to build
(CONTINUED)9.
CONTINUED: (2)
SET’S GREAT OBELISK
It blots out the sun. Millions of tons of rock cut and
polished and assembled into a tower still UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
We see the hand of the gods in the uncanny height of the
Obelisk... and GIANT SCARAB BEETLES, bigger than elephants,
laboring as great beasts of burden. All six legs strain
against their yokes to raise massive chunks of stone.
HIGH WALLS encircle the site. This place is a prison.
A familiar sight to Bek and Zaya, but they still hate it.
BEK
Sometimes wind is just wind.
ZAYA
(gravely)
Not today of all days -- the day
Set celebrates his murder of
Osiris.
BEK
Horus... Set... I couldn’t give a
shit about either of them.
Zaya’s learned to endure Bek’s blasphemous provocations...
ZAYA
I pity the man who believes in
nothing.
BEK
(steals a kiss)
Never said I believed in nothing.
A BELL RINGS out in the construction zone...
ZAYA
Urshu will be coming back to take
his meal.
BEK
Of what, children?
As Zaya straightens her dress, Bek notices a SMALL FIGURINE
hanging from a cord around her neck. A bright-blue ceramic
representation of a man with a falcon’s head: Horus.
BEK
(off the figurine)
I told you to get rid of that.
(CONTINUED)10.
CONTINUED: (3)
ZAYA
(indignant, hiding it
under her collar)
You told me? I’m not your servant.
BEK
Me being here is dangerous enough.
If you’re caught, you’ll be out
there in the slave pits.
(beat)
And on top of everything you carry
around an amulet of Horus?
An even more ferocious blast of wind KNOCKS open the blinds.
Architectural plans BLOW off the desk and AROUND THE ROOM...
The SOUND of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS out in the hall...
ZAYA
(agitated, to Bek)
Go. I’ll finish.
Bek bounds OUT THE WINDOW with startling dexterity. He HANGS
from the window ledge by his fingertips and peers in...
URSHU
Stalks in with an ENTOURAGE of Overseers. He’s 30s, a former
military hero, tasked by Set to oversee construction of the
Obelisk. The most feared and envied man in Egypt.
Zaya’s cleaning up... This is Urshu’s house... and Zaya is
Urshu’s servant. Urshu notes his jumbled desk...
URSHU
(curt, to Zaya)
You don’t control the wind. But
I’d think you could close a window.
ZAYA
I’m sorry, my lord.
URSHU
And why is my meal unprepared?
As Zaya leaves, Urshu GRIPS her wrist. She grimaces in pain.
URSHU
If I ever find this room disordered
again I’ll throw you outside to
push stone.
Zaya nods, terrified of Urshu and EXITS...
(CONTINUED)11.
CONTINUED: (4)
BEK OUTSIDE
Jumps over to the NEXT WINDOW, opening into a HALLWAY. He
speaks furtively with Zaya as she leaves Urshu’s office...
BEK
This is the last day you’ll be
forced to serve him.
(beat)
I’m buying you from that bastard.
ZAYA
With what?
BEK
At the festival, there’ll be tons
of tribute for the king.
The idea is beyond comprehension to her.
ZAYA
You plan to rob a god? In his
palace? Set can kill you with a
touch.
BEK
He also has a lot of money.
ZAYA
You’ve never tried anything like
that before.
BEK
You don’t know what I’ve tried.
ZAYA
(grips her Horus figurine)
Have faith.
Bek dismissively waves away the wishful thinking.
BEK
Even if Horus comes and puts a
spear through Set’s skull -- then
what? In Egypt you’re either rich,
poor...
(off the slaves outside)
...or nothing.
Zaya doesn’t have a response. It’s the hard truth.
BEK
I choose rich.
(CONTINUED)12.
CONTINUED: (5)
Bek gives Zaya a last kiss and LEAPS OFF THE WINDOW LEDGE.
BACK IN URSHU’S OFFICE
As the Overseers summarize the day’s progress... Urshu
catches sight of an oddly bright dot on the floor... He
bends to touch it -- a drop of OIL, reflecting the sun.
ON URSHU. Sniffing it. Suspicious.
URSHU
Mendesian.
EXT. GREAT OBELISK - DAY
Bek EXITS Urshu’s luxurious FOREMAN’S PAVILION... Snatches
an untended JUG OF WATER to blend in with the other FREE MEN
running errands to and from the FRONT GATE...
SOLDIERS OF SET
Monitor the site. Uniforms emblazoned with Set’s RED SYMBOL.
Bek sees a LINE OF NEW SLAVES file through the GATE in
chains, fresh labor for the Obelisk...
BEK
(to himself)
Always someone’s got more than you,
but always someone’s got less...
Bek hears CRIES OF PAIN and the SIZZLE of burnt flesh.
HIGH PRIESTS OF SET stand before burning braziers. They
MUTTER incantations. The flames turn an unnatural BLOOD RED.
The Priests heat BRANDING IRONS in the magical flames and
BRAND the newcomers’ shoulders, marking them as slaves.
NEARBY, a DESPERATE SLAVE in the work zone is delirious with
dehydration... Bek inadvertently catches his eye...
DESPERATE SLAVE
(off Bek’s jug of water)
Please.
ON BEK. He doesn’t want to get involved... but he can’t just
leave the guy like this. Bek surreptitiously ROLLS THE JUG
to the Desperate Slave...
A CRUEL OVERSEER’S BOOT comes down on the jug. He scans the
crowd to see who sent the water... Bek keeps his head down.
(CONTINUED)13.
CONTINUED:
The Desperate Slave’s last bit of hope empties into the dust.
He makes a MAD DASH for the GATE -- and accidentally COLLIDES
with Bek...
BEK
(voice low to the Slave)
Don’t. You bear Set’s brand.
You’re cursed now.
The Slave won’t listen. He runs wildly, PASSING the Gate --
BEK
You can’t leave --
The burnt flesh of the Slaves’s brand SPREADS ACROSS HIS BODY
like a cancer.
The dark magic turns the slave to DUST. This is “Set’s
Curse.” For the branded, there is no way out...
ON BEK. Repulsed. But that’s the way of things. He has
other, more pressing concerns...
GUARD
(waving Bek through)
Enjoy the festival.
EXT. HELIOPOLIS - DAY
The capital of Egypt sits on the banks of the mighty NILE.
Merchant ships crowd the river like an ancient superhighway.
It’s as if Manhattan were carved from marble then gilt in
gold. Engineering beyond anything we associate with the
ancient world. Brand new pyramids shine, smooth as glass.
And towering over everything, like a buttress supporting the
sky, is Set’s Obelisk.
PUSH IN ON
A long procession of WEALTHY NOBLES steadily move up a GRAND
AVENUE lined on both sides by towering golden statues...
Toward the palace GATE.
There’s anticipation in the air for the FESTIVAL celebrating
Set’s defeat of Osiris, those names on everyone’s lips.
The POOR are pressed along the avenue... They stare
longingly at the privileged wealthy as they pass...
ON BEK. Amongst the throng of poor. His expression isn't
exactly longing, but that of a hunter locked on his quarry:
(CONTINUED)14.
CONTINUED:
A caravan of tribute loaded with every TREASURE imaginable...
CHESTS of GOLD, IVORY, LAPIS and PRECIOUS STONES.
A simple FISHERMAN elbows Bek, making conversation.
FISHERMAN
Imagine having all that...
BEK
I can.
INT. GREAT PALACE COMPLEX - DAY
A grand, open-air “Hypostyle” COURTYARD that seats hundreds.
It’s surrounded by row after row of colossal PILLARS like a
forest of stone.
AT THE GATE, Bek enters with the crowd...
A broad-shouldered HOODED MAN walks with purpose,
accidentally shoulder-checking Bek.
BEK
Watch it.
The Hooded Man MOVES ON without noticing. Bek sniffs. Rude.
REVEAL the Hooded Man is Horus...
Bek DARTS stealthily behind a pillar, avoiding the watchful
eyes of SOLDIERS... Bek’s fingertips find seams in the
limestone as he CLIMBS... No one the wiser.
Osiris’ glittering Palace has changed since we last saw it.
Now the seat of Set’s power. His ARMED SOLDIERS are
everywhere. RED BANNERS drape from the marble heights. They
look like never-ending streams of blood.
SET
Sits on a THRONE on a raised dais. Implacable.
NOBLES file by Set’s feet. Bow deeply. In fear. In awe.
Blessed to be in his presence. Set does not look at them,
nor the TREASURES they bear. He is consumed by his own
thoughts.
HATHOR
Laughs. A sound beautiful as summer raindrops. The
beautiful Goddess of Love, Music, and Alcohol, 20s, stylish
in a turquoise sheath dress. She sits close to Set, her hand
on his knee. The most desirable woman anyone has ever seen.
(CONTINUED)15.
CONTINUED:
HATHOR
(flicking her hair)
How can you ignore such treasure?
Hathor is speaking of herself, of course, and Set knows it.
SET
Today has a single purpose.
She’s a perfect beauty. Perfect company. But we sense it’s
a mask. We can’t see what’s going on behind her eyes.
Festival-goers crowd in... MUSICIANS play pipes and drums.
DANCERS SHAKE ceremonial rattles -- and everything else, too.
HATHOR
(to Set)
You really think he’s going to
come? After all this time?
SET
(dry)
I’m honoring his father. How can
he not?
BEK HIGH OVERHEAD
HOPS from PILLAR TO PILLAR in a chain of death-defying
leaps... Moving toward the PILE OF TRIBUTE...
IN THE GRAND COURTYARD
The music STOPS. Time for the entertainment to begin. An
ORATOR sets the stage for today’s performance...
ORATOR
(speaking to the crowd)
Today we mark the ascension of our
King to Egypt’s throne... as we
celebrate the downfall of craven
Osiris at his hand.
A brutish actor/warrior playing “OSIRIS” stalks out into the
courtyard. The Audience BOOS...
Another actor/warrior plays “Set.” He wears a RED HELMET
that looks like a strange LONG-SNOUTED BEAST with sharp ears.
ORATOR
Witness, fine lords and glorious
gods, a reenactment of the supreme
Lord Set’s brave vanquishing of the
wretched pretender to the crown.
(CONTINUED)16.
CONTINUED:
The Nobles in the stands wait expectantly for the action...
No less excited are a congress of
LESSER GODS
Chattering in low tones, lest they offend Set. They look
like idealized humans, above lowly mankind. Notable among
them a GOD OF VIRILITY with the personality of a Donkey. A
humorless HARVEST GODDESS. And
MNEVIS
A bullish God of Butchers. Head of Set’s Palace security.
There’s also a HALF-DOZEN BABOONS off to the side of Set’s
throne. They hunch over papyrus scrolls, busily writing down
what they see.
One Baboon accidentally spills his ink... staining Mnevis’
sandal. Mnevis draws a sword to slay the offending creature.
SET
Mnevis -- it is my guest.
MNEVIS
The God of Wisdom was your guest.
He sent baboons.
SET
Thoth prefers his own company.
ORATOR
(to the crowd)
Behold the liberation of our
splendid Egypt!
“Osiris” ATTACKS “Set.” “Set” fights back in self-defense.
A mockery of the true events. The Audience is riveted.
HATHOR
This isn’t the story I remember.
SET
One of the spoils of victory is
chronicling your opponent’s defeat.
And the cruder the performance, the
more likely Horus will be baited.
HOODED HORUS
Watches the “entertainment” from the shadows BEHIND THE
STANDS. Anger building...
(CONTINUED)17.
CONTINUED:
HIGH ANGLE, AMONGST THE PILLARS
Bek DANGLES like a spider over the PILE OF TREASURE. Below,
the GUARDS are distracted by the show... But a PORTLY PRIEST
hovers over the gifts, cataloguing them.
Bek scoops a fingerful of accumulated DUST from atop a
column... Lets it DRIFT DOWN...
The Portly Priest SNEEZES... giving Bek the chance to
silently DROP behind the treasure. Bek fills his pockets
with jewelry. But there’s only so much he can carry...
Bek’s eyes a fancy CHARIOT... It’ll fit the bill nicely.
IN THE COURTYARD
The “Set” actor WINS, pinning the “Osiris” actor beneath his
boot. CELEBRATION ERUPTS at “Set’s victory.” The God of
Virility BRAYS. A fine show, indeed.
HOODED HORUS
Has seen enough. He takes a step toward the throne...
A HAND clamps down on Horus’ shoulder --
WEPWAWET
(voice low)
This is what he wants.
It’s Wepwawet. Also disguised. Horus is surprised to see
him -- and irritated to be caught by his teacher.
WEPWAWET
Let’s get out of here while we can.
With a colossal act of will, Horus FOLLOWS Wepwawet away...
SET
On his throne. His eyes searching the crowd, disappointed...
HATHOR
Oh well. Guess you’ll have to wait
another ten years.
SET
I’m not finished.
Set steps INTO THE COURTYARD. The audience watches with
bated breath... as Set circles the trembling “Osiris.”
(CONTINUED)18.
CONTINUED:
SET
(addressing all present)
It is important that the manner of
Osiris’ death be known... That the
scribes mark the record true.
The Actor “Osiris” weeps with fear, GROVELLING at Set’s feet.
SET
Osiris begged before dying.
ON HORUS AND WEPWAWET
Horus stops in his tracks. Seething...
WEPWAWET
Keep walking...
SET
Touches the “Osiris” Actor... The man DRIES into a mummified
husk, shrivelling like salt poured on a slug. The body turns
to dust. Same fate as the cursed slave at the Obelisk...
SET
No King of Egypt should beg.
HORUS
Is pushed to the limit. He throws off his cloak, uncovering
a clutch of SPEARS --
WEPWAWET
Don’t --
SET
Senses something --
A SPEAR
STREAKS at him like a missile. It creases Set’s ear, as he
barely DODGES out of the way --
The God of Virility, however, is PINNED TO A PILLAR.
Horus strides into the courtyard, SPEAR in each fist... The
eyes of Osiris’ son burn with vengeance. A hush falls...
HORUS
Today I bring truth. Today I
avenge my father for the evil done
to him.
(CONTINUED)19.
CONTINUED:
ON BEK. Seeing Horus in the flesh for the first time, he
can’t help but be in awe.
ON THE NOBLES. Whispering in fear, “He’s come.”
ON THE LESSER GODS. Nervous they’ve chosen the wrong side.
ON THE LOWER CLASSES, peering in from outside. Their savior
is here.
ON HATHOR. She catches Horus’ eye. There’s history here.
He sees her as an enemy. She doesn’t see him that way -- but
won’t let it show.
Set grips his SCEPTER, a deadly 5,000 pound iron monstrosity.
SET
I was hoping my nephew was coming
to swear his eternal devotion.
(a half smile, to Horus)
It’s not too late to bow before me.
HORUS
I’ll bow to your dust.
It begins. Their WEAPONS CLANG loud as a thousand swords.
SET
(genuinely impressed)
I mistook your absence for
cowardice. But you’ve been
practicing.
Lesser gods JUMP ASIDE. Mnevis draws his sword halfway...
then stops. All afraid of Horus.
HORUS
(to the lesser gods)
Now, later... it doesn't matter.
Horus ferociously CHARGES -- sends Set BACKPEDALING into
THE FOREST OF PILLARS
Bek SCAMPERS UP A PILLAR like a monkey to get out of the
way... Priests and Nobles run hither and thither...
Horus SHOULDERS PILLARS ASIDE like a battering ram... The
gods’ fierce duel takes them
RIGHT BELOW BEK. His high perch TOTTERS like a gargantuan
bowling pin...
(CONTINUED)20.
CONTINUED:
Bek LEAPS onto another pillar. Safe until a mighty swing of
Set’s scepter CRACKS that pillar, too.
BEK
Oh come on.
High above the clashing titans, Bek BOUNDS from pillar to
pillar as they fall like dominoes...
Bek eyes the CHARIOT OF TREASURE below -- at least the god-
combat scattered the Soldiers...
Bek SLIDES DOWN a tipping pillar like a ramp... HOPS A RIDE
on another pillar about to grind him to a pulp...
...and drops TO THE FLOOR, next to the Chariot.
HORUS
Loses sight of Set in the maze of Pillars... Now he hunts.
But every time he has a bead on Set, he’s GONE the second
Horus STRIKES. Set is everywhere and nowhere...
SET
I thought your sight was perfect,
but you aim like a drunk.
HORUS
God of Confusion, I can see
everything.
HORUS’ P.O.V. Looking through the pillars with X-RAY VISION.
Sees multiple Sets -- but only one casts a shadow. His
vision focuses to a narrow beam, pinpointing his target --
Horus THROWS. The SPEAR flies true --
It punches through two pillars on its way to Set, STRIKING
HIM IN THE CHEST. Set FALLS.
The CROWD GASPS. Nobles, in horror. The poor, exultantly...
HORUS
Die god of rot. Your body will be
given to the cats, and the offal
cast to the reptiles.
But Set RISES, very much alive. SNAPS the spear.
HORUS
(stunned)
Why aren't you dead?
(CONTINUED)21.
CONTINUED: (2)
SET
Maybe you should have practiced
more.
ON HORUS. It makes no sense. Frustration fans his anger.
BEK
STRAPS the Chariot’s BRIDLE around his shoulders.
BEK
Second thing I’m going to buy is a
horse...
Bek hears an inhuman screech. He thought he’d seen it all:
Horus transforms into a GREAT FALCON.
Set responds by becoming the massive, four-legged JACKAL-
CREATURE. Wings beating, the Falcon digs CLAWS into its foe.
Bek DUCKS as the god-beasts GRAPPLE... It’s only a matter of
moments before the whole temple collapses.
Bek PULLS the chariot like a mule, teeth gritted -- but the
Portly Priest and two SOLDIERS block his way.
PORTLY PRIEST
You’re a thief.
BEK
And you’re a priest.
(looks him in the eye)
The question is, which one of us is
more committed to his job?
A chunk of stone HITS right beside them. The Portly Priest
and Soldiers RUN. So much for commitment.
Bek throws his weight into the bridle as pillars SMASH DOWN
all around him. He HEAVES the Chariot, threads the needle --
OUT OF THE PALACE
As the whole structure comes CRASHING DOWN. Bek made it.
From out of the wreckage, the Jackal-Creature CLAMPS its jaws
on the Falcon and FLINGS it into the giant PALACE GATE.
The Falcon TRANSFORMS back to HORUS, getting his bearings.
The impact CRACKED the GATE... If it falls, it’ll hit Bek’s
chariot of treasure.
(CONTINUED)22.
CONTINUED: (3)
Bek sees a NOBLEWOMAN near Horus, her dress pinned by RUBBLE.
NOBLEWOMAN
(to Horus)
Help me...
Horus RUSHES Set, oblivious to the Noblewoman and her fate.
The stone gate TEETERS -- she’s sure to be crushed --
Bek makes a split-second decision. He pulls the Noblewoman
OUT OF THE WAY as the Gate starts to FALL...
NOBLEWOMAN
Thank you, kind sir --
But Bek’s already RUNNING BACK to the chariot. LUGS IT out
of the way in the nick of time as the Gate HITS --
The Noblewoman pats at her throat. Her NECKLACE is missing.
BEK IN THE CROWD
Casually tosses the necklace he just stole into the chariot,
adding it to the rest of his treasure.
SET
In human form again, backs down the avenue lined with
towering GOLDEN STATUES of Ra. Baiting Horus to follow...
SET
With no father to protect you, your
mother came to me one night.
Willing to do anything to keep you
safe... Anything at all...
HORUS
Shut up...
As Horus’ fury grows, heat distorts the air around him...
SET
Which, it turned out, was quite a
lot.
HORUS
Shut up.
As super-heated Horus pursues his enemy, cloth banners BURST
INTO FLAME at his passing...
Set smirks as Horus gets angrier and angrier.
(CONTINUED)23.
CONTINUED:
SET
Wrath thy name is Horus. And by
thy name undone.
Horus feels a DROP on his shoulder. It’s MOLTEN GOLD.
The giant golden statues are MELTING from Horus’ heat. They
crumple like soft wax on top of him... He’s KNOCKED DOWN by
the weight...
Set STRIKES him with the full might of his scepter. Horus
FLIES BACK in a spray of liquid gold --
Horus STRUGGLES to rise, but Set HAMMERS him... until Horus
lies defeated. Set reaches down...
And PLUCKS out both of Horus’ EYES.
Horus’ eyes appear as JEWELS glinting magically in Set’s
fist. A theft of Horus’ very essence.
SET
(addressing the crowd)
Even though I was provoked, Horus
still lives. I am Set the
merciful.
Horus CRAWLS AWAY, BLINDED... gold running like a stream
around him...
ON HATHOR. A thousand emotions flash across her face before
she successfully feigns disinterest...
ON WEPWAWET. His worst fears have come to pass.
THE CROWD is stunned. Even Set’s faithful are staggered by
what’s transpired. For the Lower Classes, all hope is gone.
BEK
(to himself)
This is why praying’s a waste of
time.
Bek COVERS his treasure with a torn banner and ROLLS IT AWAY.
EXT. FOREST - DAY
Dense forest. Horus CRAWLS, seeing only with his
fingertips... his eyes BLINDFOLDED with torn cloth.
HORUS
(to the North Winds)
Father... I failed.
(CONTINUED)24.
CONTINUED:
Horus pounds the ground in frustration. Trees tremble.
INT. FORGE - GREAT PALACE
CLOSE ON A HAMMER brought down on an ANVIL -- each blow
bright as a meteor strike.
A HELMET has been forged. The metal glows red as blood
spilled by hate. Set admires his handiwork... and fits ONE
JEWELED EYE of Horus into the faceplate.
SET
Finally. The Right Eye of Horus.
EXT. FARMLAND - DAY
Wepwawet follows a TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION, accompanied by SIX
OTHER GODS in the form of athletic men and women... Allies
of Horus.
They see crops flattened. Boulders split. A granary reduced
to rubble. Like a tornado cut a path through the farmland...
FARMERS hurry past, fleeing the source of the mayhem.
FARMER
Turn back. He’s mad...
Horus’ Allies keep following the trail... They find
Horus on the move, blindly swinging his fists. Horus rips
off branches, stiff-arms trunks into SPLINTERS. His eyes are
wrapped with a BLINDFOLD torn from his tunic.
WEPWAWET
Easy, Horus...
Horus HALTS, recognizing the voice. There’s nowhere to go
anyway. Hot, impotent rage withers the grass at his feet.
HORUS
My anger did not defeat me.
(baffled)
He withstood a mortal blow from my
spear... I don’t know how.
Wepwawet does not want to provoke him by arguing the point.
WEPWAWET
Set’s trickery is famed.
Wepwawet presses a bottle into Horus’ hand. Horus takes a
drink. It calms him an iota.
(CONTINUED)25.
CONTINUED:
HORUS
She was with him. And I doubt she
was tricked.
Emotion plays across Horus’ face at the thought of Hathor.
WEPWAWET
You’re always in Hathor’s heart,
you know.
HORUS
(bitterly)
Yes, she’s got a big heart. Room
enough for a crowd in there.
WEPWAWET
The Goddess does what she needs to
survive Set’s rule... And we will
do what we need to end it.
ON HORUS. Despair sets in.
HORUS
The last thing I saw was the face
of my father’s murderer. Now it’s
all I’ll ever see.
WEPWAWET
I’ve learned one of your eyes is
secured in his treasury. We’re
going to steal it back.
Wepwawet, steely-eyed, stands ready. His six Comrades, too.
HORUS
(that’s madness)
Set’s treasury is surrounded by
deadly traps no god can pass. You
told me that.
WEPWAWET
(gathering his courage)
Any trap that can be sprung can be
dodged. It’s time I tested my
mettle against Set’s.
HORUS
It’s too dangerous.
WEPWAWET
In all the years we’ve been
friends, when has it ever been
safe?26.
EXT. FOREMAN’S PAVILION - GREAT OBELISK - DAY
Set observes the countless slaves building his Great Obelisk.
As he walks into the massive shadow it casts, the structure’s
unfinished tip eclipses the SUN...
URSHU
(off the Obelisk)
No one has so honored the great god
Ra, who rises on the horizon day by
day.
SET
I’m sure my father will find this
pile of stone a worthy substitute
for the son I killed.
Set squints up at the sun... then turns to Urshu.
SET
You only have three days before the
sun is at its closest... The
Obelisk must be finished by then.
URSHU
It will be. Ra will pass by its
high peak and marvel at the
greatness you have built in his
name.
SET
Truthfully, I honor myself as well.
(ordering him)
You will entomb these slaves within
the Obelisk upon its completion.
Urshu does not pause at the impending mass murder...
URSHU
It will be their honor to serve you
even in death.
ANGLE AROUND THE CORNER
Bek overhears, alarmed. In rich man’s clothes, waiting
beside his treasure-laden chariot for an audience with Urshu.
SET
Many of these mortals worshipped
Horus. They will die with their
prayers unanswered.
ON BEK. He has got to get Zaya out of here, now.27.
INT. OFFICE - FOREMAN’S PAVILION - LATER
Urshu’s busy going over the plans with his Engineers... His
Guards bring “wealthy” Bek before him...
BEK
I’m here to purchase one of your
servants.
URSHU
I can’t spare any.
BEK
Are you sure?
Urshu sees the CHARIOT in the courtyard, full of treasure.
Can’t help but be impressed. He gestures to his SERVANTS...
URSHU
Pick one and leave.
But Bek doesn’t see Zaya among them...
BEK
Don’t you have one with green eyes?
At this, Urshu and the GUARDS exchange a look...
URSHU
(cool, to the Head Guard)
Fetch her.
While they’re waiting, Urshu gets conversational...
URSHU
You’re a man of wealth. Have you
had much problem with thieves?
BEK
Just have to be smarter than them.
URSHU
I’ve found evidence of an intruder.
But I could find nothing stolen.
Bek doesn’t like where this is headed... especially when he
sees that GUARDS have blocked the windows and doors.
URSHU
So I had the place searched again,
not to see if anything was
missing... but to see if anything
unusual could be found.
(CONTINUED)28.
CONTINUED:
Urshu holds up Zaya’s HORUS FIGURINE for Bek to see...
Zaya’s DRAGGED IN by Guards, her clothes dirty and torn.
BEK
Zaya --
Zaya’s terrified. Urshu strokes her cheek...
URSHU
As if using my home for your
fornicating wasn’t sufficient.
(off her figurine)
This didn’t save you, did it? Set
is your god.
Guards with DRAWN SWORDS encroach on Bek...
Bek grabs Urshu’s ARCHITECTURAL PLANS -- Holds the plans in
one hand, a burning LAMP in the other...
BEK
Be a shame if our beloved god’s
obelisk wasn’t finished on time.
Urshu signals his Guards to MOVE AWAY FROM THE DOOR...
URSHU
(nonchalant, to Bek)
Take her, then.
Zaya SNATCHES her HORUS FIGURINE off the floor... She and
Bek BOLT OUT, tossing the plans once they’re clear.
EXT. GREAT OBELISK - DAY
Bek and Zaya RUN through the construction site, teeming with
activity... Soldiers CONVERGE...
AHEAD, two massive BLOCKS OF STONE, big as boxcars, are being
pushed toward each other, the gap between them CLOSING FAST --
Bek and Zaya DASH THROUGH THE NARROWING GAP a moment before
they would’ve been crushed. The Soldiers ARE CUT OFF, for
the moment. Bek and Zaya reach
THE MAIN GATE
The SENTRIES here haven't been alerted yet...
BEK
We can make it --
(CONTINUED)29.
CONTINUED:
ZAYA
Just you.
Zaya STOPS and pulls up her sleeve, revealing the brand of
Set. She can never leave.
ZAYA
(with a grim smile)
It stings a little.
Bek reels...
ZAYA
I’ll manage...
BEK
(off the Obelisk)
They’re going to kill the slaves
soon as that thing’s done.
ZAYA
(shaken)
How long?
BEK
Three days.
(impotent fury)
I’ll break the curse. I’ll kill
Set myself.
ZAYA
(unwavering)
You can’t. Only Horus can.
BEK
He fought like a fool and now he’s
blind.
ZAYA
You always said you can steal
anything...
(presses the Figurine in
Bek’s hand)
Steal his eye. Give it back to
him.
The Soldiers are CLOSING IN, led by Urshu...
ZAYA
It’s the only way you can save me.
BEK
I’m not putting my faith in him.
(CONTINUED)30.
CONTINUED: (2)
Zaya gives Bek a kiss goodbye -- a lifetime of passion
pressed into seconds --
ZAYA
We’ll argue about it later.
Before Bek can stop her, Zaya runs into the clutches of the
Soldiers.
ON BEK. Slipping THROUGH THE GATE to freedom... He feels
like his guts have been ripped open.
INT. SET’S TREASURE VAULT
A vast CHAMBER. Pillars, walls, ceiling -- every surface is
METAL polished to a shine. Austere as a bank.
A SHORT GUARD ENTERS, carrying a covered birdcage. It’s Bek
in disguise.
ON BEK. Focused. He won’t let Zaya down.
Turning a corner, he sees the last thing he expected -- all
the GUARDS are sprawled dead on the floor.
Bek peers over the EDGE OF THE BALCONY...
A DEEP ROOM the size of a football field. Endless GOLD BARS
from wall to wall. The wealth of a god in ordered stacks.
A LONG BRIDGE traverses the cavernous vault. Bek‘s eyes are
drawn to something among the treasure UNDER THE BRIDGE...
A groaning BODY. It’s Wepwawet, dying.
The other SIX GODS lie dead among the gold. Wepwawet got the
furthest, which isn’t very far at all.
WEPWAWET
You’re not a guard...
BEK
Tell me about the traps. What
killed you?
Wepwawet EXPIRES before he can answer.
As a test, Bek TOSSES his helmet OVER THE BALCONY --
The helmet hits the floor of gold bricks... the bricks MOVE,
attacking the helmet with STINGERS --
Underneath every brick lies a SCORPION, plump with venom.
(CONTINUED)31.
CONTINUED:
When the Scorpions realize there’s no flesh within the
helmet, they rearrange themselves into neat rows, carrying
the Bricks on their backs. You’d never know they were there.
Bek scans the multitude of bricks with a shudder...
BEK
Where do you even get that many
scorpions?
The bridge is divided into THREE SPANS. The closest is made
of SILVER. The next span is GOLD. The last he can’t see.
Bek swallows hard... and considers the first hurdle:
THE FIRST SPAN -- THE BRIDGE OF SILVER.
Metal STATUES OF SET as a Jackal-Creature line the bridge on
both sides, facing each other at ten foot intervals. To
cross you have to walk past them. It’s unnerving.
Bek removes the hood from his CAGE. Frees a pair of PIGEONS.
Bek FLICKS a handful of BIRDSEED along the bridge... Watches
the pigeons HOP along the tiles, PECKING --
The birds SPRING THE TRAP. Two statues of Set facing each
other FLEX their METAL ARMS -- pulling a RAZOR SHARP WIRE
taut between them.
The pigeons COO, unscathed. It would have cut a man in half.
BEK
Be a mess to clean up.
The trap RESETS. Pressure-sensitive floor-tiles? Maybe
that’s what he’s supposed to think... Bek looks closer...
ON BEK. So that’s Set’s secret:
BEK
(to a pigeon)
It’s a bait-and-switch. Set
doesn't think like a god. He
thinks like a criminal.
Bek notes the BIRD SHADOWS cast by the light of a BURNING
BRAZIER...
SNAP. It’s the bird’s shadow that triggers the trap.
Bek LIGHTS a torch... Holds it out in front of him to ERASE
THE SHADOW... And is able to cross the first span...
(CONTINUED)32.
CONTINUED: (2)
THE SECOND SPAN -- THE BRIDGE OF GOLD.
Also lined with Statues of Set -- but these grip long curved
DAGGERS.
Bek throws more seed. The pigeons trot over to eat it...
Nothing happens until they FLUTTER INTO THE AIR --
The entire Bridge of Gold FOLDS IN ON ITSELF like a bear
trap. The statues’ daggers slice together like giant
scissors. The pigeons flit up out of danger.
The bridge clanks OPENS, trap RESET. But what triggered it?
Bek sees a PIGEON FEATHER dancing on an unseen WIND...
Bek grinds a handful of birdseed into a fine POWDER under his
heel... and BLOWS it into the AIR... revealing:
A crisscrossing web of nearly invisible LINES -- jets of air
blowing in all directions from the Statues’ mouths. If
anything disrupts their stream, the trap is sprung.
Bek BLOWS clouds of seed powder in front of him... navigating
the maze of air “tripwires,” as he CROSSES THE SECOND SPAN...
THE THIRD SPAN -- THE BRIDGE OF MAGIC.
Built of BLACK STONE. Obsidian Statues of Set line the
bridge, each holding an OBJECT of wonder and magic...
A FEATHER OF THE PHOENIX, exquisite as a rainbow. The SKY
NECKLACE OF SHU, made of cloud. A TAMARISK SAPLING, bare and
withered. A GOBLET filled with milk from the breast of Nut.
A GEMSTONE bright as the noonday sun. The Eye of Horus.
BEK
That’s it.
Bek tosses a handful of birdseed... but the pigeons are
hesitant to go further, spooked.
BEK
This is how you thank me for all
the meals we’ve shared?
Bek SPRINTS full bore down the bridge... SWATTING magic
items off the statues as he passes --
TRAPDOORS open in front of each magic item as he KNOCKS THEM
OFF... But Bek’s moving fast, one step ahead. He doesn't
fall in --
(CONTINUED)33.
CONTINUED: (3)
The Feather flutters down... The Necklace floats away...
Running, Bek GRABS the Eye of Horus. He’s going to make it --
In front of him, a thirsty PIGEON lands on the Goblet of
Milk...
BEK
Oh no --
The pigeon TIPS OVER the goblet, tripping the trapdoor.
Which is, unfortunately, right under Bek.
Bek FALLS --
DOWN INTO THE VAULT
Bek SLAMS onto gold bricks... Hears thousands of tiny legs
skittering... Shuts his eyes and waits for stinging death.
But death does not come. Bek opens his eyes...
A MASS OF SCORPIONS surround Bek, stingers raised... all held
at bay by the glowing Eye of Horus in his hand. The
scorpions RETREAT from the light in a polluted tide.
Bek looks at the Eye warming his palm... and triumphantly
closes his fist over his prize.
EXT. CANYON - SET’S TREASURE VAULT - DAY
Bek EXITS the vault, making haste down the CANYON protecting
Set’s treasury... The Eye GLOWS in Bek’s hand...
HORUS (O.S.)
Where are my allies?
A SPEAR swings out of the shadows -- Bek barely DUCKS --
Blind Horus EMERGES from behind a boulder, smoldering like a
volcano... Tracking Bek with keen ears.
BEK
They’re all dead.
The news is like a knife through Horus. It can’t be true.
HORUS
You’ve got my eye. I can feel it.
BEK
It was there for the taking. I
took it.
(CONTINUED)34.
CONTINUED:
HORUS
No mortal could rob Set’s vault.
You must have pilfered my eye from
Wep’s corpse...
BEK
He never even got close.
Horus STRIKES again, smashing a rock. It’s only because the
god is blind -- and Bek is quick -- that Bek survives.
BEK
Stop. I have a proposition --
HORUS
You dare bargain with me for what
is mine?
Horus JABS AGAIN. Bek dodges.
BEK
You’re lucky I’m willing to. You
can’t hit a thing.
HORUS
He was the god of stealth. I knew
of no one braver or more loyal.
(dismissive)
What are you? Some thief?
BEK
Yeah. Some thief.
HORUS
You want a reward I suppose? Gold?
BEK
Gold I can steal.
(beat)
There’s a slave I want freed.
HORUS
A lot of work for a slave.
BEK
I’m dedicated. She’s been cursed
by Set.
ON HORUS, cooling. He lowers his spear...
HORUS
And cursed she will be until Set’s
death.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)35.
CONTINUED: (2)
HORUS (CONT'D)
(holds out his palm)
Seems we want the same thing. So
give me my Eye.
BEK
I only have three days.
HORUS
Three days?
BEK
Set won’t need slaves after he
finishes his little construction
project. And he kills what he
doesn’t need.
HORUS
I trained ten years for my first
battle with Set -- and still I was
not ready. Maybe twenty more --
BEK
I don’t have twenty years. I don’t
have a week. I have three days.
HORUS
It can’t be done.
BEK
(edge of desperation)
Well figure it out.
(off the Eye)
Or maybe I should toss this in the
Nile.
HORUS
Wait.
ON HORUS, thinking.
HORUS
Did you really sneak past Set’s
traps or was that an idle boast?
BEK
I boast, but I don’t lie.
HORUS
(mind working)
Wep and I would sit up at night...
talking of all the ways to kill
that dung-eater. There was one mad
plan, born of an excess of wine...
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)36.
CONTINUED: (3)
HORUS (CONT'D)
But even Wep did not have the
skill.
(to Bek)
Today you did what he could not.
Maybe tomorrow you can do more.
BEK
Me?
HORUS
I will kill Set in three days -- if
you assist me.
ON BEK. He wasn’t expecting to actually work with Horus...
HORUS
My eye, mortal. Do we have an
agreement?
BEK
My name is Bek.
Bek tosses the eye to Horus -- who pops it back in his head
with a BURST OF LIGHT. Horus can see again, his empty socket
still covered with the strip of cloth.
Horus is able to look Bek up and down for the first time...
HORUS
You’re small, Bek.
EXT. ROCKY GULLY - LATER
Bek and Horus are in a secluded, rocky place. The two
unlikely allies warily taking stock of each other.
HORUS
The God of the Desert will die if
we destroy the desert itself.
BEK
All of it?
HORUS
Why, are you fond of sand?
(beat)
Within Set’s temple is the Fire
that is the source of his power.
Extinguish that, and he fades away.
The whole of the Nile could not
quench that fire... But a few
drops from the waters of creation
can.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)37.
CONTINUED:
HORUS (CONT'D)
I will fly to the heavens and
collect some from the prow of Ra’s
boat.
Bek raises an eyebrow. Wow.
BEK
That’s a good job for you.
HORUS
Plainly.
(continuing)
However, Set’s Fire is guarded by
the Sphinx.
ON BEK. Worried. He’s heard the stories...
BEK
You know the answer to its riddle?
HORUS
No.
BEK
It’ll tear us to pieces.
HORUS
Which is why the second thing we
must do is convince the God of
Wisdom to answer it for us.
(beat)
A formidable task in its own right.
BEK
So what do you need me for?
HORUS
The hardest job of all.
(beat)
Set’s pyramid of sand is ten times
the challenge his treasury is.
Guarded by the deadliest traps he’s
devised. Walls, floors, nothing
stays still. Always moving. Made
of crushing sand and stone.
BEK
A maze only the cleverest thief
could conquer.
HORUS
I will settle for you.
(CONTINUED)38.
CONTINUED: (2)
Horus and Bek CREST A RIDGE. A panoramic view of the land.
In the distance, a malevolent strip of red: the Desert.
HORUS
Set will hunt us every step of the
way.
BEK
Let him.
Horus likes that answer. He looks at the SUN, low on the
horizon...
HORUS
Keep out of trouble until I return.
I go to collect water from creation
or die in the doing.
Horus TRANSFORMS into a Falcon and TAKES TO THE SKY --
Bek watches Horus FLY AWAY... Wondering what he’s gotten
himself into.
EXT. NEPHTHYS’ STRONGHOLD - SUNSET
A mountain-top Aerie... UNDER SIEGE from Set’s SOLDIERS.
Arrows fill the air, shooting down BIRDS trying to escape.
SET
(to his Archers, off the
birds)
Do not let a single messenger
escape.
INT. NEPHTHYS’ STRONGHOLD - SUNSET
POUNDING at the gate...
NEPHTHYS
Is cornered. 40s, plain-faced. The Goddess of Weavers. Her
great feathered WINGS are folded against her back.
Great doors BREAK OPEN under a withering assault. Set RUSHES
IN, flanked by his Soldiers. They engage a DOZEN GOD
BODYGUARDS in fierce HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.
The Bodyguards flash various animal heads in the melee, but
none of them can withstand Set’s mighty scepter.
Nephthys shrinks back from Set, afraid but defiant... Set
picks at a length of LINEN spilling from a loom.
(CONTINUED)39.
CONTINUED:
SET
Is it right that a goddess should
perform such labor?
They clearly have a past. They were once husband and wife,
before the death of Osiris.
NEPHTHYS
Since you became king, the need for
burial shrouds has been great.
SET
(brushes back her hair)
You could have been a queen.
NEPHTHYS
Your brother was already married.
Set fumes at the mention of Osiris, forever jealous.
SET
What if I told you I would pardon
you for leaving me at my moment of
triumph? You could wear the crown
that is your right.
NEPHTHYS
(coldly)
After all the years we shared, you
should already know my answer.
SET
That makes this much easier.
Set rips ONE OF NEPHTHYS’ WINGS from her body -- it clatters
to the ground as GOLD.
Nephthys looks to Set in horror. This is unthinkable. She
uselessly flaps her remaining WING in a pathetic corkscrew
attempt at escape, CRASHING back to the ground...
Set TEARS OFF Nephthys’ other wing. She sinks to the floor,
listless but conscious.
NEPHTHYS
(weakly, off her wings)
You would rob me of my very
essence... The others won’t stand
for this.
SET
No one will know what’s happened
here until it’s too late.
(CONTINUED)40.
CONTINUED: (2)
NEPHTHYS
(can’t understand)
Why? You’re already king...
Set keeps the answer to himself...
The bullish god Mnevis ENTERS.
MNEVIS
Lord. Your royal treasury has been
breached.
SET
By who?
MNEVIS
A mortal. The smell is
unmistakable.
SET
(alarmed)
What did he steal?
EXT. EGYPT AS SEEN FROM SPACE
Horus the Falcon FLIES HIGH into the STRATOSPHERE... so high
the curvature of the earth can be seen. From up here, the
Nile’s blue line looks like the artery of creation.
Above, through a break in the clouds...
A magnificent SAILING SHIP cruising at the edge of space.
RA’S BOAT. Its hull and splendid sails of purest gold. A
titanic CHAIN rises from the ship’s deck into the heavens.
Ra’s boat pulls THE SUN itself around the Earth each day.
Horus the Falcon pushes himself higher... INTO THE CLOUDS...
The air here is TURBULENT... for this is the chaotic,
primordial stuff from the time before creation... Gusts tear
violently at Horus the Falcon, throwing him back...
The wind strips feathers from his wings, threatening to rip
him apart... Battered, he FALLS...
Plummeting to earth, Horus retakes the FORM OF A MAN, stunned
like a pugilist...
HORUS
Father, let your strength be mine.
Still falling, Horus finds it within himself to press on...
(CONTINUED)41.
CONTINUED:
HORUS
I am the Lord of the Sky. I will
enter the celestial waters --
Horus TRANSFORMS back into a Falcon and redoubles his
efforts, again thrusting into the CLOUDS...
...until, with a final burst of strength, he BREAKS THROUGH --
EXT. RA’S BOAT
The Falcon LANDS on the deck, TRANSFORMING back into Horus.
What looks like a man in his 50s sits sharpening his SPEAR on
a GRINDSTONE... Sparks spit and pop off the shining blade.
Battle-scars mark his sinewy body. Deep crows-feet line eyes
fierce as a storm. He is
RA
Lord of the Cosmos. Majestic and mighty, moral and wise. He
does not look up as Horus drops to a knee and bows.
HORUS
Hail, thou Great God Ra.
RA
Normally when a bird lands on my
boat uninvited I kill it before it
can shit.
HORUS
Forgive me, grandfather. I would
only ask something of you...
RA
In that case I’ll stop what I’m
doing and heed your bidding.
HORUS
I mean no disrespect --
RA
You don’t know the difference.
Ra’s keen eyes plumb the SHADOW brewing on the HORIZON...
RA
Sit and be silent. I have work to
do.
Ra CRANKS a massive WINCH... Letting out miles and miles of
the mighty chain...
(CONTINUED)42.
CONTINUED:
The Sun, thus released, DIPS below the horizon...
Ra’s boat passes into NIGHT... A chill wind whips the
sails... Horus finds his knees weakened by dread...
A SHADOW uncoils from the abyss, size beyond imagining...
APOPHIS
Rises like a thunderhead... The Demon of Chaos. Defined by
blackness, its gargantuan silhouette is REPTILIAN...
Ra stands tall on the ship’s bow... and readies a SPEAR
glittering with cosmic power. Apophis ROARS --
The demon’s TAIL, wide as a cyclone, SMACKS the hull --
Horus is THROWN against the mast, grabs on for dear life...
Ra answers with stabs of WHITE FIRE from his spear.
Apophis’ head opens like a mile-long red chasm... revealing a
MOUTH wide enough to swallow Ra’s boat... It seems to Horus,
wide enough to swallow the whole world...
Ra stands his ground, STRIKING the beast in the darkness.
Apophis’ ear-spitting HOWL rocks the boat as their duel
SHAKES THE FIRMAMENT...
RA
Crawl back to shadow, you stinking
worm.
A final jab of his spear... and Apophis SHRINKS BACK into the
black primordial sea...
RA
You shall not feast on creation.
(beat)
Until tomorrow, at least.
Ra leans against his spear, tired... As his boat SAILS on, a
beautiful canopy of STARS envelops them.
Ra uncorks a jug of wine and drinks with gusto. Enjoying the
taste of life the way only one who faces death can. Horus
shows his respect with silence.
RA
You know when to keep quiet.
HORUS
There are no words for that.
(CONTINUED)43.
CONTINUED: (2)
We see how heavily Ra’s burden weighs upon him.
RA
How different things would be if I
could dwell amongst my children in
the garden of the Nile... Instead
it is my burden to fight the demon
Apophis night after night. So that
Egypt is not destroyed by chaos.
(pointed)
There are things worse than Set.
HORUS
You’re wrong.
RA
You’d say that? Even after what
you’ve just witnessed?
HORUS
That demon isn’t the one who
murdered my father, your son.
RA
They are both my sons. Speak to me
in that tone again boy, and I will
slap you into the abyss.
HORUS
Allow me to fill my flask with
these waters.
RA
(considers this)
The waters are not mine.
Horus leans over the side of the hull and dips his flask into
the WATER OF CREATION. Water, but not water... Air, but not
air... It sparks with life as it flows into the container...
RA
You plan to quench the desert fire?
Bold. But if you kill Set, you
will be king. How will you rule?
HORUS
I don’t plan to rule at all.
Ra frowns.
RA
How did you get your eye back?
(CONTINUED)44.
CONTINUED: (3)
HORUS
A mortal.
RA
Intrepid of him.
HORUS
He had the gall to strike a bargain
with me. But I need him to break
into Set’s Temple of Sand.
RA
He will surely die there.
HORUS
There are many sacrifices on the
path to vengeance.
RA
Does he know he’s one of them?
HORUS
He’s a mortal. He doesn't know
anything.
RA
I had hopes for you. But all you
want is revenge.
Ra turns away from Horus in disgust.
RA
I do not approve of Set or how he
rules Egypt. But I don’t know that
you would be much better.
(terse)
Now get off my boat.
EXT. FOREST - DAY
Bek RUNS for his life through THICK FOREST...
Mnevis and a gang of FOUR BRUTISH BULL GODS (in their human
form) are hot on his tail.
Bek ZIGZAGS through trees... but his pursuers CUT HIM OFF...
Mnevis SEIZES Bek, dangles him inches from his slimy snout...
MNEVIS
(sniffs him)
Found you. Where is the Eye of
Horus?
(CONTINUED)45.
CONTINUED:
BEK
Up your behind, alongside the goat
you keep there.
Mnevis slams Bek against a tree.
MNEVIS
I’ve seen all the ways a man can
die. Fast, slow, dirty, clean.
Mnevis presses the tip of a NASTY BLADE under Bek’s ribs...
BEK
I choose fast, but I’ll settle for
clean.
MNEVIS
Where is the Eye of Horus?
HORUS
(from off-screen)
Right here.
Horus walks into the middle of the Bull Gods... Holds his
spear like a bolt of lightning.
MNEVIS
(surprised)
I thought you were crawling
sightless in the mud somewhere.
Mnevis RELEASES Bek. The Bull Gods exchange uneasy
glances... Even five against one, this is Horus.
MNEVIS
(mustering his courage)
Cut him down.
The Bull Gods CHARGE Horus, blades drawn --
Horus JABS at Mnevis, but something’s off. He’s not as fast.
Mnevis BRINGS HIS SWORD down on Horus’ spear shaft -- KNOCKS
the weapon out of Horus’ hand.
Surrounded, Horus ROLLS to recover his weapon -- DEFLECTS two
strikes, but a third SLASHES HIS RIBS... Gods don’t bleed,
but their wounds shine, raw and real. Horus WINCES...
MNEVIS
See, brothers. Without his other
eye he is weak...
(CONTINUED)46.
CONTINUED: (2)
Bek watched Horus bring down a stone temple like it was made
of twigs. What’s wrong with him now?
Horus backs into a defensive stance BETWEEN TWO TREES. The
first Bull God attacks, overeager --
Horus SHOULDERS him against a tree trunk, PINNING HIM as --
A second Bull God strikes... Horus spins the second attacker
into the first. A WET SLICING SOUND... and both COLLAPSE.
Horus made them stab each other.
Horus levels his gaze at Mnevis and the two remaining Bull
Gods, who feel cold fear spread through their guts.
HORUS
Even if I was blind...
Horus TRIPS the Bull God to Mnevis’ left, who SLAMS flat on
his back --
Mnevis’ sword stroke MISSES Horus...
HORUS
Deaf...
Horus THRUSTS upward two-handed, delivering a LETHAL BLOW to
the Bull God on Mnevis’ right --
HORUS
And bereft of limbs...
BELLOWING, Mnevis SLASHES at Horus again, hitting only air...
HORUS
...I’m still a match for you.
Horus JAMS his SPEAR through Mnevis’ chest.
ANGLE BEHIND HORUS. The last surviving Bull God GETS UP...
Because of his EYE PATCH, Horus can’t see him coming --
BEK
(warning him)
Horus --
Horus WHIPS AROUND and SLAYS the last Bull God.
BEK
You have a blind spot.
There’s no “thank you for saving me” forthcoming.
(CONTINUED)47.
CONTINUED: (3)
HORUS
I told you to do one thing. Stay
alive until I got back.
BEK
Last time I saw you fight you were
knocking down pillars like they
were nothing. Now you need me to
keep you from getting skewered?
Are you sure you can do this?
Horus turns on Bek in fury... The troubling implications of
his newfound weakness is not something Horus wants to face.
HORUS
The only reason I saved you,
mortal, is you are useful to me.
Don’t test my patience.
Bek sees the hypnotically swirling Water of Creation in
Horus’ flask...
BEK
That’s really Water of Creation?
HORUS
Yes.
BEK
What would happen if I drank it?
HORUS
You would be refreshed. And then
you would die.
BEK
It doesn’t seem right that the
Water of Creation would kill.
HORUS
I would kill you. For wasting my
water.
BEK
Now that we’ve got it, let’s go get
our answer from the God of Wisdom.
We only have two days left.
HORUS
We may have less time than that...
Worried, Horus scans the world for miles in every direction.
(CONTINUED)48.
CONTINUED: (4)
HORUS
The roads will be watched now...
(off Mnevis’ body)
And Set will send better hunters.
INT. SET'S PALACE - DAY
Set sits on his throne. Hathor at his side looks bored.
Dead Mnevis and the Bull Gods are lined up on display.
ANAT and ASTARTE
Poke at the bodies, examining the wounds... Two warrior
goddesses. Exotic beauties, 20s.
Quick-tempered Astarte wears a wicked helmet topped with the
horns of a bull. Anat’s clad in panther skin, battle axe at
the ready -- she’s calculating and sadistic.
ANAT
(off the bodies)
This one dropped his guard... This
one must have misjudged his
speed... This one badly missed a
side-stroke... And these two
killed each other.
ASTARTE
Too bad for them you didn’t summon
us sooner.
ON SET. Brooding on the return of his enemy.
SET
I didn't know Horus had his sight
back.
HATHOR
(to Set, off Anat and
Astarte)
Why bring this trash into your
home? They’re only worshipped by
cannibals and rapists.
Astarte kicks her spear to Hathor’s exquisitely shod feet,
inviting a fight. Hathor toes it away, declining the offer.
ASTARTE
As I thought.
SET
(to Hathor)
The desert is my home.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)49.
CONTINUED:
SET (CONT'D)
(to Anat and Astarte)
Find Horus and you may keep his
remaining eye. I have the only
piece of him I need.
ANAT
We will deliver him to you.
SET
No. Incinerate him, along with the
thief.
ON HATHOR. A distressing thought, but she can’t let it show.
SET
(to Hathor)
Unless you want to see his face one
last time?
HATHOR
Good hunting, ladies.
EXT. FOREST - DAY
ON HORUS, WALKING briskly over rough ground and underbrush...
HORUS
We should be at Thoth’s library
soon if...
Horus stops, realizing he’s talking to nobody.
Bek’s LAGGING BEHIND, breathing hard.
BEK
I need... to rest.
HORUS
We’ve only been travelling nine
hours.
Bek SITS, exhausted.
BEK
You can fly.
HORUS
I can. Can you?
BEK
Couldn’t you carry me?
Horus doesn't dignify that with an answer.
(CONTINUED)50.
CONTINUED:
Horus impatiently waits for Bek to recover...
HORUS’ P.O.V. Locking onto a SAPLING a half a mile away.
From this distance invisible to the human eye.
Horus hefts his spear, AIMS AT THE SAPLING... But his vision
isn’t crisp like it was. It wavers now, unstable...
Horus lets the spear FLY with such speed the SONIC BOOM
knocks Bek flat on his back --
The spear MISSES the sapling... ATOMIZING a massive tree.
Bek doesn’t know it was a miss.
BEK
You don’t have to keep trying to
impress me.
HORUS
Wasn’t even close.
ON HORUS. Doubt. A new feeling for him. He hates it.
Horus sits straight-backed on a rock near a STREAM. He hands
Bek a CUP from his belt...
BEK
What’s this?
HORUS
So you don’t have to bring me water
cupped in your hands.
BEK
I’m not your slave.
HORUS
My father taught me it was unworthy
of a god to smite a man.
BEK
He should’ve taught you to get off
your ass and get your own water.
Horus BACKHANDS Bek INTO THE STREAM with a splash.
HORUS
(to the North Winds)
Sorry, Father.
As Bek CLIMBS OUT OF THE STREAM... the SMALL FIGURINE of
Horus falls from Bek’s pocket.
(CONTINUED)51.
CONTINUED: (2)
Horus considers the falcon-headed statue’s likeness...
HORUS
The brow lacks majesty and the beak
is crooked.
(shrugs)
I’ve seen worse.
BEK
It’s not mine.
ON BEK. A stab of emotion as he thinks of Zaya...
BEK
Let’s go. We’re losing time.
Horus can see Bek’s still exhausted...
HORUS
You look weak.
BEK
I’m fine.
HORUS
(it occurs to him)
I think you need food. Humans need
food.
BEK
What do you know about humans?
Bek stubbornly keeps moving...
HORUS
I insist.
(gesturing)
This land is bountiful. Eat.
Bek relents. Not because he’s tired and hungry -- which he
is -- but because he can’t help but be amused at this god who
doesn’t understand the first thing about men.
BEK
We don’t eat trees.
EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE FOREST - LATER
A blur through branches... something moving fast... A
CHARIOT pulled by a pair of HORSES with the speed of gods.
Astarte yanks the reins to halt the beasts -- the violence of
the stop cuts a trench beneath their hooves.
(CONTINUED)52.
CONTINUED:
Anat steps from the chariot to push her hand into the earth.
They’re tracking Horus and Bek...
ASTARTE
What do the worms tell you?
WORMS wriggle to the surface in a line, pointing the way to a
SMALL CITY ahead...
ASTARTE
He’s close.
Anat puts a wooden FLUTE to her lips. Plays a shrill NOTE...
Far away, a chilling sound like a LIVING WINDSTORM ANSWERS...
INT. KING’S QUARTERS - SET'S PALACE
Hathor and Set recline on cushions, sipping wine... Discrete
Musicians play captivating MUSIC, promising sensual delights.
Hathor takes another hearty sip. Half-drunk. Trying to
forget the past, anxious to reach sweet oblivion.
SET
You’re thirsty this evening.
HATHOR
With wine this good, no excuse is
necessary.
SET
Your wine is always good.
Set leans in to kiss her... Hathor smells something on him:
HATHOR
(teasing)
Who is she?
SET
What do you mean?
HATHOR
I can smell her on you.
SET
Jealous of my hunters?
HATHOR
(shakes her head)
I know that scent... Feathers and
linen. Bland and boring.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)53.
CONTINUED:
HATHOR (CONT'D)
(realizing)
Why would you go see your former
wife?
SET
I haven’t seen Nephthys since the
night she left me.
ON HATHOR. She knows he’s lying. Her questioning was all in
fun -- but now she’s stumbled on something more. If Set
suspects her, she’s dead.
HATHOR
(quickly covering)
My mistake.
(laughs it off)
I can smell a woman on a man years
later. Drives me crazy -- and my
men too.
Set nods, amused. Hathor gets up...
HATHOR
I’ll light incense --
SET
(pulls her back to him)
Later.
INT. HALLWAYS - PALACE - LATER
Hathor slips from Set’s bedchamber... Pads down the halls...
careful to stay out of sight from patrolling Guards...
INT. FORGE - SET'S PALACE
Hathor ENTERS silently... Eerie shadows play off WEAPONS
forged by Set... Hathor’s gripped by a wave of foreboding...
as she sees the ARMOR Set has been fashioning.
The HELMET with Horus’ eye in the VISOR... and a BREASTPLATE
with a JEWELED HEART.
SET
Did you find what you were looking
for?
Set stands behind her, blocking the exit.
SET
(off the breastplate)
Osiris’ heart was never recovered.
(CONTINUED)54.
CONTINUED:
HATHOR
That’s why Horus couldn’t kill
you...
Hathor backs away from Set... and collides with Nephthys’
golden WINGS... She recoils from the dismembered parts...
HATHOR
You’re waging war on the gods?
Set SEIZES her arm -- his touch starts to DECAY HER FLESH...
A jeweled BRACELET on Hathor’s wrist GLIMMERS SUPERNOVA-
BRIGHT. Her skin HEALS as Set’s curse is repelled.
Set shields his eyes -- the bracelet’s too bright to look at.
Hathor SPRINTS out the door. She’s got a good head start,
but she better keep running...
EXT. SMALL CITY - DAY
Horus CONCEALS HIS FACE under the hood of a cloak... as he
and Bek WALK through narrow, quiet alleys. Here and there,
SOLDIERS of Set keep watch...
INT. TAVERN - DAY
Bek and Hooded Horus ENTER a working-class tavern.
HORUS
(off Bek, to the Barkeep)
Bring him some food.
The BARKEEP raises an eyebrow at Horus’ imperious tone, but
doesn’t recognize the god beneath his hood.
BARKEEP
To drink?
HORUS
Your finest beer. Quickly.
BEK
(to the Barkeep)
I guess two.
The Barkeep moves off...
BEK
(to Horus)
That’s not how mortals talk if they
want good service.
(CONTINUED)55.
CONTINUED:
HORUS
I am used to more than service. I
expect worship.
Bek eats the food provided. Horus drinks from his cup.
BEK
(to Horus)
Do you even get thirsty?
HORUS
I like the taste.
Horus wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, raps his
fist on the table. Satisfied.
HORUS
(to the Barkeep)
This place pleases me. Ask, and
find me generous.
BARKEEP
It’s called paying.
Horus pats his waistband... He has no money. Why would he?
HORUS
I, uh...
BEK
(irritated)
I’ve got it.
EXT. OUTSIDE THE CITY - DAY
Bek and Hooded Horus cross a FIELD dotted with ROCK PILES.
This is where the poor are buried.
They happen upon a POOR MAN’S FUNERAL. His linen-wrapped
body is lowered into a simple pit. His WIFE weeps. The man
may not have been rich, but he was loved by many.
HORUS
(to Bek, confused)
What is this?
BEK
You’ve never seen a funeral?
HORUS
I have. Not like this. This man
takes nothing with him to the
Afterlife.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)56.
CONTINUED:
HORUS (CONT'D)
(beat)
Without treasure, he won’t be
granted entry.
BEK
(terse)
Not everyone has treasure.
A grand funeral PROCESSION passes through, disrupting the
Poor Man’s memorial... headed toward a city of low brick
buildings: MASTABA TOMBS for the wealthy dead.
Dozens of NOBLES and their SERVANTS transport a Rich
Charioteer in his SARCOPHAGUS. They also carry a dazzling
display of gold and jewels.
The RICH CHARIOTEER’S WIFE is infuriated that their passage
is being inconvenienced by the poor man’s funeral.
RICH CHARIOTEER’S WIFE
(to the Poor Man’s Wife)
Only dogs lack the sense not to run
out of the way of a chariot. At
least my husband will not be
troubled by dogs in the Afterlife.
The Poor Man’s Wife absorbs the insult.
Horus is troubled. He approaches the POOR MOURNERS with his
hood pulled low. They have no idea he is a god...
HORUS
What happened here?
POOR MOURNER
Our friend was selling fish in the
market, when a Rich Man’s chariot
came galloping down the street --
didn't care who was in his way. He
struck our friend and died himself
when he was thrown.
EXT. MASTABA TOMBS - DAY
Horus and Bek WALK ON... Mastaba Tombs in every direction.
Bek’s surprised to see Horus introspective...
HORUS
His murderer journeys to the
Afterlife, but the poor man does
not...
(CONTINUED)57.
CONTINUED:
BEK
This is the way things are down in
the dirt with us mortals. Better
to be a gold-plated bastard than a
beggar full of charity. Dying’s a
rich man’s game.
(beat)
Why do you think I’m a thief? When
I die -- many, many years from now
by the way -- I plan to stroll into
the Afterlife like him.
Bek points back at the Rich Charioteer’s funeral procession.
ON HORUS, none of this seems quite right...
The quiet is broken by the sound of the LIVING WINDSTORM...
BEK
(with a chill)
What is that?
Horus knows. He pulls Bek behind cover...
HORUS
Get down -- or your plan to live
many years will be ruined.
HORUS’ P.O.V. Far-off, Anat and Astarte’s chariot... cutting
like a streak across the horizon.
HORUS
(grimly)
Anat and Astarte. Set’s hunters.
In the distance, a SPRAY OF FIRE rakes the farmers’ fields...
A huge SHAPE UNDULATES WITHIN THE SMOKE... The source of the
terrifying windstorm sound.
HORUS
A pet of theirs. I can’t withstand
its fire.
(off his missing eye)
Not as I am now...
ON HORUS. At a loss what to do...
BEK
Then I guess we should run.
HORUS
Run?
(CONTINUED)58.
CONTINUED: (2)
BEK
Mortals do it all the time.
Horus and Bek ZIGZAG through the grid of SQUAT TOMBS... A
hushed city of the dead, enfolding them like a maze...
BEK
We’re going in circles.
The WINDSTORM fills their ears, louder now... The pursuing
creature getting closer...
Bek and Horus hurry down a ROW OF TOMBS... A STREAM OF FIRE
suddenly BLOCKS their way, close enough to curl the hair of
Bek’s eyebrows. They’ve run out of options...
Horus and Bek hear ROCK SCRAPING ROCK behind them --
It’s Hathor, standing in the DOORWAY of a SECRET PASSAGE.
Bek can’t help but be captivated by her beauty.
BEK
Hello, my name is --
Horus’ good eye shoots daggers at Hathor.
HORUS
You.
HATHOR
Just shut up and come with me.
Horus TURNS BACK to face the oncoming creature instead...
BEK
(to Horus)
I thought we were running away from
the thing that burns up gods...
HORUS
Its company is preferable.
HATHOR
(off Horus’ missing eye)
You know you have no choice.
You’re half the god you used to be.
ON HORUS. She’s right and he hates it. Horus FOLLOWS her
INTO THE SECRET PASSAGE
(CONTINUED)59.
CONTINUED: (3)
HATHOR
(over her shoulder)
Lucky those bitches don’t know the
history of this place. While he
was constructing the tombs, the
architect built a hidden passage
here... so he could have secret
liaisons with the Queen.
They reach an UNDERGROUND RIVER. Hathor DIVES IN...
BEK
Uh, how long do I have to hold my
breath?
Horus DIVES IN, too. A BLAST OF FIRE cooks the passage. Bek
JUMPS IN after them --
EXT. LAGOON - DAY
A coughing, waterlogged Bek trudges from the water... The
underground river led to a SECLUDED LAGOON.
Horus and Hathor wait on shore in chilly silence. Neither
offers Bek a hand.
BEK
Don’t worry. I’m still alive.
No response. Bek flops down to rest.
Hathor dips an empty wine sack in the WATER and magically
TRANSFORMS it into WINE.
HATHOR
(off Horus’ missing eye)
I think it makes you look roguish.
It’s sure to become a trend.
Hathor offers Horus some wine. A peace offering. He doesn't
take it.
Bek reaches out his hand -- he’ll have some wine. Hathor
ignores him like he doesn't exist. Typical.
HATHOR
(to Horus)
You’re welcome for saving you.
Horus finally looks at her, furious.
HORUS
Explain yourself.
(CONTINUED)60.
CONTINUED:
HATHOR
Don’t talk to me like I’m your
wife.
HORUS
So while I was crawling blind
through a forest, you consorted
with the god who pulled out my
eyes?
Hathor’s fingers trace the length of her curvy frame...
HATHOR
Why would I waste this on someone
who can’t see?
HORUS
You’re a demon.
HATHOR
(playing with her hair)
So you’ve said. For years.
HORUS
I don’t know why you even bothered
rescuing me.
Bek looks back and forth, trying to figure them out...
HATHOR
He tore the wings off Nephthys...
It was horrible. He’s forging some
kind of armor.
(after a beat)
He kept your father’s heart.
Horus takes in that appalling revelation...
HORUS
And now my eye.
(gravely)
He’s making a full suit of it then.
HATHOR
Why? He already has everything.
HORUS
He wants to finish what he started.
To humiliate and destroy all who
championed my father.
(beat)
Once Set finishes his armor, he’ll
be too strong to stop.
(CONTINUED)61.
CONTINUED: (2)
BEK
Does that change our plan?
HORUS
No.
(to Hathor)
We’re breaking into Set’s desert
temple to kill him once and for
all.
Hathor’s shocked. No one’s ever tried to do that before.
HATHOR
How were you two jesters planning
on getting in?
Horus nods toward Bek...
HATHOR
(off Bek, it’s ridiculous)
Him?
HORUS
After we see Thoth.
HATHOR
(unenthusiastic)
Why would you ever do that on
purpose?
HORUS
Can you answer the riddle of the
Sphinx?
EXT. MARSH - DAY
Bek, Horus and Hathor SLOG thorough a SWAMP of tall, reedy
PAPYRUS PLANTS... Hathor lags, fatigued. She sips from her
wine sack...
HORUS
Not the best day to be hungover.
Horus scoops her up and CARRIES her. Hathor doesn't
complain.
Bek smiles to himself. Horus won’t show it... but it’s
obvious how much he cares about her.
HORUS
You drink too much.
(CONTINUED)62.
CONTINUED:
HATHOR
I’m the Goddess of Too Much.
There’s plenty I’ve given you
you’ve never found excessive.
Horus can’t argue with that.
HATHOR
(to Bek)
So why are you here? Are you
seeking treasure?
BEK
I used to.
HATHOR
Never stop.
(to Horus)
When am I getting some?
HORUS
Look to your wrist, if the effort
is not too great. There you will
see the Bracelet of Forty-Two
Stars, one for each of the demons I
slayed in the getting. To keep you
safe from any curse.
(pointed)
To remind you of the one who gave
it to you.
Hathor admires her BRACELET. So does Bek. It sparkles like
the Big Bang.
HATHOR
This old thing?
Hathor drains the last of her wine... Still thirsty, she
beckons Bek... Her eyes are mesmerizing...
HATHOR
Be a dear and fetch me something
wet. There must be a pool of clean
water somewhere.
BEK
(not seduced)
You’re all the same, aren’t you?
Hathor stares quizzically at Bek, who braces for her
temper... But instead a genuine smile spreads over her face.
(CONTINUED)63.
CONTINUED: (2)
HATHOR
(intrigued, excited)
What’s her name?
BEK
Who?
HATHOR
I can make any man, woman, god or
beast do my bidding -- unless their
heart belongs to another. You’re
in love.
HORUS
He is?
BEK
(after a beat)
Her name’s Zaya.
HATHOR
(chin cupped in her hands)
Tell me everything.
BEK
We grew up in a nothing village.
Maybe if we’d had more, the way
people in the city do, I wouldn’t
have noticed the little things...
Like how just before the sun hid
behind the mountains the light
would catch her eyes... It was
prettier than your bracelet.
Hathor sighs, transported by Bek’s words...
HATHOR
That was the first time you kissed
her, wasn’t it?
(backhands Horus)
Why don’t you ever talk about me
that way?
Bek looks off, barely containing his emotion...
ON HORUS. He’s risked death beside this mortal... and now
realizes how little he knows him.
HATHOR
(hinting, to Horus)
I’m still thirsty.
Hathor WAVES AWAY Horus: give her a minute with Bek alone.
(CONTINUED)64.
CONTINUED: (3)
Her gaze seems to plumb the depths of Bek’s heart.
HATHOR
What happened?
BEK
We thought we needed more. So we
ran away from home. Stupid. We
had no idea how dangerous the world
was.
(beat)
We were captured by slavers and
crammed below the deck of a boat.
I tried to break us free... But
there were too many men with too
many swords. I went overboard,
left for dead. Zaya stayed on the
boat, in chains.
HATHOR
Now she’s one of the thousands
building that hideous obelisk, no
doubt.
BEK
This time, I’m going to save her.
HATHOR
I believe you will.
HORUS NEARBY
Has unearthed a spring. He kneels, filling Hathor’s wineskin
with water... Bek approaches...
HORUS
I didn’t know about your woman.
BEK
You didn't ask.
(an awkward beat)
With your eye, can you see her?
Horus gazes at the horizon...
HORUS’ P.O.V. Miles away, AT THE OBELISK... Zaya puts all
her strength into inching a heavy stone forward... An OLDER
WOMAN SLAVE next to her drops in exhaustion...
Zaya kindly helps the Older Woman to her feet before a CRUEL
OVERSEER notices. The Older Woman is thankful. They muster
their strength to keep working...
(CONTINUED)65.
CONTINUED: (4)
BACK TO HORUS AND BEK
HORUS
She has courage.
Bek’s relieved Zaya’s alive. But he’s still afraid for her.
BEK
We have what, two days until Set
sacrifices Zaya and all of them --
Why? Some piggish gesture?
HORUS
She’ll be freed in time. I
promise.
BEK
(sincere)
You know, seeing her from so far
away doesn't do her justice. You
can’t hear her voice. Right now,
she’d be saying “I told you so.”
(off Horus’ questioning
look)
She’s the one who told me to trust
you.
Bek WALKS BACK to Hathor...
ON HORUS, ALONE. Feeling guilty for using Bek, Horus pounds
the ground in frustration. Looks up at the sun...
HORUS
(speaking quietly, to Ra)
What would you have me do? I have
no choice. I need him.
A thicket of papyrus reeds PARTS -- A BABOON sticks his head
out and SHRIEKS in surprise...
HORUS
I guess we’re here.
EXT. THOTH’S LIBRARY - DAY
Busy BABOONS harvest papyrus, cut it into strips, beat it
with mallets, press it under rocks. They’re making PAPER.
THOTH’S LIBRARY stands beyond this assembly line. Stark,
clean, and modern, it’s known as the “House of Life.”
The DOORS are small as the baboons who stream in and out...
(CONTINUED)66.
CONTINUED:
BEK
I thought I was short...
HORUS
The doors are for the baboons.
Thoth never leaves.
They bend down and SQUEEZE THROUGH the under-sized doors...
Horus’ shoulders barely fit. He swears under his breath.
INT. THOTH’S LIBRARY - DAY
No windows -- just shelves lined with billions of SCROLLS.
Baboons CLIMB up and down, organizing all the world’s
knowledge...
THOTH
Hunches over a chaotic mess of scrolls. 20s, eccentric,
socially awkward, convinced of his own genius. Fingers black
with ink, Thoth rapidly inscribes hieroglyphics... Baboons
come and go, rolling and unrolling scrolls in front of him...
HORUS
Wise Lord of the Sacred Word, we
come before you seeking counsel --
Thoth silences Horus with a raised finger... Finally, he
looks up, impatient.
Thoth shields his eyes from Hathor...
THOTH
(to Hathor)
You. Turn around.
HATHOR
You prefer the view from behind?
THOTH
(flustered)
No, I... Yes. You know I can’t
lie. I’m not going to risk looking
at those tricky eyes of yours.
Thoth turns to Horus, giving him his priceless attention.
HORUS
I need --
THOTH
The answer to the riddle of the
Sphinx.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)67.
CONTINUED:
THOTH (CONT'D)
(off Horus’ surprise)
A child could deduce why you’re
here.
Thoth leans back in his chair, fingertips pressed together.
THOTH
I’m feeling magnanimous, so I’ll
help you.
Horus and Bek share a look. That was easy.
THOTH
Go ask the riddle, then come back
and relay it to me. I’ll solve it.
HORUS
Uh, one of us would have to die...
THOTH
Draw lots.
HORUS
Come with us.
The notion actually makes Thoth laugh.
HORUS
Are you afraid you’ll get it wrong?
THOTH
Playing on my vanity? This is the
cleverest strategy you could
devise?
HATHOR
(still facing the wall)
One night. I’ll give you one
night.
HORUS
(to Hathor)
No, you won’t.
(turns back to Thoth)
Set is forging some kind of armor
made from the stolen essences of
gods... What little vulnerability
he has shrinks by the day.
Thoth snorts. But behind his eyes, this information impacts.
(CONTINUED)68.
CONTINUED: (2)
HORUS
Set must be stopped before he
eradicates us all. You see the
wisdom in that...
(no answer)
Don’t you?
THOTH
(under his breath)
I made a deal with him.
HORUS
What?
Horus’ anger starts to SMOLDER...
THOTH
Set doesn’t bother me, I don’t
bother him.
(explains)
Study requires quiet. Set may keep
the peace at the edge of a sword,
but it is peace.
HORUS
Cockroach. I’ll snap your neck.
THOTH
(back to his studies)
I have work to do.
Horus’s uncontrolled rage sets scrolls on FIRE... Baboons
rush to douse the flames...
THOTH
Get out.
Bek sees this has turned into a disaster.
BEK
I know something you don’t.
THOTH
(noticing him)
I thought you were one of the
baboons...
BEK
(continuing)
But you have to come with us to
find out what it is.
(CONTINUED)69.
CONTINUED: (3)
THOTH
I can recite the true names of the
stars. I’ve seen the world created
from sand and water. You think
there is anything you know that I
don’t?
BEK
What does the sun feel like on your
shoulders?
ON THOTH. He doesn't know.
EXT. THOTH’S LIBRARY - DAY
Thoth looks up at the SKY... Dreary clouds hide the sun.
THOTH
(grumbles, off Bek)
It’s not even sunny... pfft.
EXT. DEAD FOREST - DAY
A FOG settles... Horus, Bek, Hathor and Thoth WALK through a
graveyard of once-great trees. The ground is grey, ruined
forever.
RUINS emerge from the fog like spectres... A giant statue of
OSIRIS lies on its side, its decapitated HEAD big as a whale.
To Horus, it feels as if his father’s eyes are judging him.
Bek keeps pace alongside Horus, indifferent to the ruins...
BEK
Your temper almost cost us back
there.
HORUS
My anger has helped keep you alive.
What was that worth?
BEK
Not much if it costs me Zaya’s
life. What do you have to be angry
about?
Thoth and Hathor look at Bek. Doesn’t he know where they
are?
THOTH
(quietly, to Bek)
Here is where Osiris fell.
(CONTINUED)70.
CONTINUED:
BEK
(looking around)
Set salted the earth?
HORUS
It wasn’t Set. It was my mother’s
tears.
BEK
I think it’s more than his murder
eating at you.
HORUS
I don’t care what you think.
BEK
Even with one eye, you complain
about being weak. Weak is not
throwing spears for miles. Weak is
not flying up to the sun. Weak is
not winning when you’re outnumbered
five to one.
HORUS
I did not choose a path of revenge.
I did not choose to be king. I
chose none of this.
(beat)
So you tell me -- what kind of
power do I really have?
BEK
You sound like a mortal. Tough to
feel powerless, isn't it?
They all hear the “living windstorm” blow out of nowhere...
Horus, Bek and Hathor know this sound...
THOTH
The wind sounds alive...
HORUS
It is.
Horus readies his spear. They all peer into the fog...
Ahead, a giant FALLEN PILLAR blocks their way.
THOTH
That pillar was not there before.
The pillar MOVES... RISING UP --
It’s a GIGANTIC BLACK COBRA.
(CONTINUED)71.
CONTINUED: (2)
The Cobra towers over them. The “wind” is its vicious HISS.
BEK
Run?
HORUS
It’s too close.
HATHOR
So what do we do?
Horus doesn’t know. His confidence is shaken... But Bek
realizes Horus is their only chance...
BEK
Is strength all that makes you a
god?
Horus gathers himself, holding forth his spear...
HORUS
Serpent, depart from us now or I
will divide your head in two.
The Cobra’s HOOD FLARES, preparing to strike...
Horus squints his good eye, aiming... lets his spear FLY --
The spear GRAZES the Cobra’s scales... but MISSES.
Horus curses. Now his weapon is gone, lost in the fog.
A SECOND COBRA, this one WHITE, rears up to join the first.
BEK
Well, its head is divided in two.
The Cobras bare FANGS like ivory scimitars and SPIT streams
of BURNING VENOM like napalm --
Horus raises a flat CHUNK OF STONE to SHIELD them. The
marble DISINTEGRATES under the onslaught of burning venom...
HORUS
(to the rest of them)
Now run.
Bek, Hathor and Thoth SPRINT into the fog...
Horus is alone with the monsters. A SLURPING sound as the
Cobras draw more venom, reloading...
They SPIT -- Horus DODGES twin annihilating sprays. He knows
he can’t outrun this doom...
(CONTINUED)72.
CONTINUED: (3)
Horus CIRCLES BACK... straight at the Black Cobra.
The Cobras abort their attack to avoid burning each other.
But now Horus is close enough to be bitten. He barely twists
OUT OF THE WAY as fangs scissor the air...
BEK, HATHOR AND THOTH
Take cover behind some ruins... Hathor sees a STREAK cutting
a trail through the fog --
HATHOR
(shouts to Horus)
Look out!
THE CHARIOT
Speeds toward Horus, pulled by supernaturally swift horses.
Almost too fast to see.
Astarte AT THE REINS. Anat beside her, teeth bared in blood
lust, swings her BATTLE AXE at Horus as they ZING PAST --
Horus DUCKS, feels the blade whistle past his ear...
ANAT ON THE CHARIOT
PLAYS a series of notes on her wooden FLUTE...
THE BLACK COBRA obeys the musical command. GRABS Horus in a
coil of its tail...
ON THOTH. He hears the FLUTE... Realizes their method.
THOTH
Of course, the tones...
Thoth scans the ground...
THOTH
Now to find a suitable branch and
carve a simulacrum.
Crouched nearby, Hathor rolls her eyes. Typical Thoth.
Bek BOUNDS UP a broken ramp of stones, on a mission...
HORUS
Trapped in the Black Cobra’s embrace... He struggles to free
his arms as the serpent’s JAWS OPEN...
(CONTINUED)73.
CONTINUED: (4)
ANAT AND ASTARTE
Circle back on the chariot, relishing Horus’ predicament...
ANAT
He’s no falcon.
ASTARTE
Leave a piece for me.
Astarte HANDS THE REINS to Anat... and DISMOUNTS at a run...
Astarte HEADS INTO THE RUINS after the others, using her own
FLUTE to call the White Cobra to her...
HORUS
Pulls one arm FREE as the Black Cobra STRIKES --
Horus HAMMERS the Cobra’s FANG with his FIST. The force of
the blow SNAPS OFF the giant tooth. The Black Cobra RECOILS,
leaking venom from the broken stump.
Horus sees Anat steer the CHARIOT around for another run...
He can’t DISENTANGLE from loosened coils fast enough...
Anat raise her AXE. This time she’ll have Horus’ head...
BEK
JUMPS from a high wall ONTO THE MOVING CHARIOT --
Death defying. Bek shoulders Anat’s arm, so that she MISSES
Horus with the axe...
Anat SLICES at Bek... Bek GRABS THE REINS and PULLS --
The HORSES dig in. The Chariot BRAKES HARD -- Anat and Bek
are both THROWN FREE...
HORUS
Finally ESCAPES the Black Cobra’s coils... Picks up its
BROKEN FANG...
BEK
Lays on the ground, stunned.
Anat gets to her feet, unfazed by the tumble. Raises her axe
high over Bek... ready to separate his head from his body...
(CONTINUED)74.
CONTINUED: (5)
ANAT
(to Bek)
Be honored. I’ll keep your skull
as a souvenir.
Suddenly Anat looks down: the Cobra’s FANG protrudes from her
chest.
Anat FALLS DEAD. Horus stands behind her holding the fang
like a sword. One goddess down.
Bek and Horus catch their breath. It’s obvious to both that
they make a good team... but being men, neither say anything.
BEK
(pointing behind Horus)
Um --
The Black Cobra REARS UP over Horus, its malice bent toward
the one who hurt it. Horus ZIGZAGS into the ruins, the giant
serpent in PURSUIT...
ASTARTE AND THE WHITE COBRA
Nose through the fog... Find
Hathor, alone. Unarmed. Seemingly helpless.
ASTARTE
Pretty girl. You don’t belong in
battle.
Astarte blows a sharp tone on her FLUTE... The White Cobra
bares its fangs, dripping liquid fire...
ASTARTE
Burn her.
Hathor STARES into the reptile’s eyes...
HATHOR
(to the Cobra)
What a beautiful creature you are.
The Cobra’s pupils WIDEN, hypnotized. Astarte frantically
BLOWS the Flute, but the White Cobra isn’t listening now...
ASTARTE
(to the Cobra)
Burn her --
HATHOR
No.
(CONTINUED)75.
CONTINUED:
The giant snake FREEZES in place, in Hathor’s control.
Astarte CHARGES Hathor in a fury --
Hathor defiantly holds her ground. We’ve never seen this
side of her. Strong. Angry. Powerful.
HATHOR
You think I’m not a fighter? I
just don’t like getting my hands
dirty.
Hathor flicks a finger as if she had a speck under the nail --
At Hathor’s command, the White Cobra VOMITS AN INFERNO on
Astarte. She desperately blows into her Flute... It’s
BURNED AWAY a second before she is.
The White Cobra then rakes a stream of fire across its own
skin. INCINERATES itself to please its Mistress Hathor.
One cobra and one more goddess down, but Hathor collapses
from the strain...
HORUS
Scrambles up onto the giant stone head of Osiris... as the
Black Cobra hunts him through the fog...
Horus LEAPS ONTO the Black Cobra’s WRITHING BODY, gripping
the scales. The Cobra furiously thrashes, trying to shake
him -- while Horus CLIMBS hand over hand onto its HEAD...
As he’s whipping around, Horus spots his SPEAR -- it’s
punched through a monolith of stone, STUCK TIGHT. Its sharp
point sticks out the other side...
Horus STRIKES a blow between the Black Cobra’s inky eyes.
Dazing it. Horus wrestles the Cobra backwards... A
controlled fall, guided by Horus -- STRAIGHT ONTO THE TIP OF
HIS SPEAR.
The Cobra’s own weight drives the spear through its skull,
which BURSTS into a bubbling mass of fire...
Horus drops to the ground. Tired, dirty, victorious.
HORUS
I am Horus, son of Osiris, and I
will never be overthrown.
Thoth RUSHES UP, playing a HOMEMADE FLUTE he carved from a
branch... Then he sees the battle is over.
(CONTINUED)76.
CONTINUED:
THOTH
Oh.
(off his flute)
This would have worked.
HORUS
(concerned)
Hathor?
THOTH
Fine. Tired. She killed the other
one with greater ease than you.
Horus shrugs as he wrestles his spear out of the rock...
THOTH
And your mortal?
HORUS
Capable, as always.
THOTH
Yes, about that. I was thinking --
HORUS
Always thinking.
THOTH
...if we do vanquish Set, all the
artifacts his power has raised up
will fall down.
HORUS
Good riddance.
THOTH
Set’s pyramid is made of sand.
We’ll be standing under it.
HORUS
So we’ll dig out.
THOTH
How will the human survive?
Horus avoids Thoth’s gaze.
THOTH
Evidently you’ve already considered
this.
WE REVEAL BEK, listening from the other side of a statue...
Neither of them knows he’s there.
(CONTINUED)77.
CONTINUED: (2)
HORUS
I’ll shield him.
THOTH
That might work. Might not. You
should tell him.
HORUS
And if he declines to take the
risk? We can’t get in without him.
THOTH
I just believe the truth should
always be told.
HORUS
(hard)
I’m standing on my father’s grave
and my mother’s tears. I will have
justice.
ON BEK. Rocked by betrayal. So that’s how it’s going to be.
BEK
(under his breath)
You’ll never get your justice.
BACK AT THE CHARIOT
Bek EASES toward the HORSES, who bare their teeth at him. He
takes FIGS from his pack, tosses one to each horse.
BEK
(patting their neck)
You know the way to Heliopolis?
Hathor comes up behind Bek as he gets on the Chariot.
HATHOR
What are you doing?
BEK
Ask Horus.
Hathor sighs sadly. It doesn't take a genius to do the math.
HATHOR
I could stop you...
Bek puts his hand on Hathor’s arm. Squeezes it with emotion.
BEK
You won’t.
(CONTINUED)78.
CONTINUED: (3)
Hathor watches the Chariot ACCELERATE AWAY, faster than the
speed of sound...
ONBOARD THE CHARIOT
Bek holds tight as the world RUSHES BY in a hallucinatory
trail of light...
Bek glances down at his palm: he stole Hathor’s Bracelet of
Forty-Two Stars.
EXT. GREAT OBELISK - DAY
Zaya labors to complete the Obelisk amongst the thousands...
The Older Woman just can’t keep pace... The Cruel Overseer
raises his baton to deliver additional motivation...
CRUEL OVERSEER
(to the Older Woman)
You don’t stop.
Zaya KICKS the Overseer from behind. She staved off the
Older Woman’s punishment, but now Zaya’s facing a beating...
ZAYA
(to the Overseer)
Do what you have to. I did.
Before the Overseer can strike Zaya... he’s HOISTED INTO THE
AIR, raised up the Obelisk like a flag up a pole --
LOOKING CLOSER, there’s a rope hooked to the Overseer’s belt.
He SHOUTS OUT, dangling from up high, drawing everyone’s
attention --
BEK
Hey.
Zaya turns to see Bek standing next to her. She gasps.
BEK
(off the Overseer)
Pretty good distraction if you
didn't even notice me...
There’s no time to celebrate their reunion. Zaya rubs her
shoulder. The brand’s still there.
ZAYA
Set’s not dead...
Bek puts Hathor’s bracelet on Zaya’s wrist...
(CONTINUED)79.
CONTINUED:
BEK
Doesn’t matter.
Bek leads her away, heads down, while everyone else’s eyes
are on the Overseer...
URSHU AT THE PAVILION
Sees the disorder in the slave area... But Urshu is not so
easily fooled. He looks elsewhere...
...and spots Bek and Zaya. They’re headed toward the Gate.
BEK AND ZAYA
Reach the threshold of the gate. Bek RUNS PAST. Zaya STOPS,
afraid. Stepping past will trigger the curse...
BEK
Trust me.
Zaya closes her eyes... and WALKS OUT OF THE GATE...
Immediately, the BRAND on Zaya’s shoulder BLOOMS WITH DECAY --
ZAYA
Bek...
The bracelet SHINES BRIGHT, repelling the dark corruption and
completely ERASING THE BRAND.
Zaya’s eyes go wide with wonderment. Her curse is lifted.
BEK
Told you I’d save you.
They JUMP IN the waiting chariot --
FSSST. What was that sound? One of the horses snorting,
ready to speed them away?
BEK
(turns to Zaya)
Let’s go...
Bek sees an ARROW buried in Zaya’s chest.
ZAYA
I...
She sinks onto the chariot floor.
BEK
Zaya?
(CONTINUED)80.
CONTINUED: (2)
For a moment that seems endless, Bek doesn’t know what to do.
URSHU AT THE PAVILION
Stands with a BOW. He coldly notches another ARROW and
shoots again --
BEK IN THE CHARIOT
WHISPERS into the horse’s ear. They TAKE OFF --
Urshu’s second arrow IMPACTS A WALL where the chariot was.
Now just swirling dust.
Bek cradles Zaya in his arms in the moving chariot. The
world around them a blur.
EXT. RED DESERT - DAY
Horus stalks forward, furious. They’ve now reached the RED
SANDS of Set’s land... Hathor and Thoth lag behind.
HORUS
He’ll meet the fate earned by all
traitors.
HATHOR
You could have averted this.
HORUS
I’ll do it without him.
Thoth is about to contradict this falsehood... then thinks
better of it.
THE CHARIOT speeds out of nowhere. Comes to a HALT.
HORUS
(to Bek, livid)
If you’ve come to beg, you may
begin.
BEK
Can you help her?
The gods see Zaya barely clinging to life. Thoth examines
her... but it’s clear to Horus her condition is dire.
Hathor gives Zaya a sip from her wineskin.
HATHOR
I can take away her pain.
(CONTINUED)81.
CONTINUED:
Zaya relaxes, soothed by Hathor’s drink. But her breathing
is shallow. She’s fading...
ZAYA
(to Bek)
I’m glad we’re together.
Zaya’s eyes close... A final exhale...
BEK
I can’t feel her heart...
(to Horus)
Save her.
HORUS
We can’t.
ON HORUS. He knows what he needs to do.
HORUS
(in a quiet voice)
Come to me, O Mighty Isis.
A mournful CRY pierces the air. A majestic bird, a KITE,
swoops down, transforming into
ISIS. The wife of Osiris stands before them in all her
majesty. The gods take a knee before her... Isis turns up
her nose at Hathor like she’s a cheap tramp.
ISIS
(to Horus)
By what right do you summon me?
The one who widowed me remains upon
my husband’s throne.
HORUS
I know.
Isis rests her palm on Horus’ empty eye, disapproving.
ISIS
How I wish I had other sons who
could honor their father, but Set
robbed us of them before they could
be born. I only have you.
Isis finally notices Bek. He’s distraught, beside the body
of the woman he loves.
HORUS
Help him, mother.
(CONTINUED)82.
CONTINUED: (2)
Bek bows before Isis, tear-streaked face in the dirt. It’s
heart-rending.
BEK
Please...
Isis sees Bek’s tears... and her own eyes well with emotion.
Isis cradles Zaya in the crook of her arm, gently plucks out
the arrow. Isis cups her hand to her own mouth, and exhales
life into her palm. It’s BRIGHT as the noon sun.
Isis presses her life-force into Zaya’s chest. The wound
seals. Zaya seems to glow from within... Isis WHISPERS into
her ear, gentle but insistent...
Bek silently prays...
The glow fades from Zaya’s body. Isis turns sadly to Bek...
ISIS
She has passed beyond where I can
reach her.
BEK
But you’re a goddess...
Isis’ shoulders sag under the weight of another defeat.
Another death.
Horus’ fists clench with helpless grief. Hathor tears up.
Thoth bows his head in respect.
Bek sits in the dirt, staring vacantly. He’s empty.
Isis removes her own silky cape to wrap the dead Zaya,
cocooning her in a BURIAL SHROUD worthy of a god.
ISIS
May she find the joy denied to us.
Isis transforms and FLIES AWAY, alone once more.
Bek hands Hathor the bracelet he stole...
BEK
Punish me.
HATHOR
That’s not what I do.
Horus PUNCHES a nearby cliff side... creating a small CAVE.
(CONTINUED)83.
CONTINUED: (3)
HORUS
She needs to be buried.
INT. ZAYA’S TOMB
The proper burial HIEROGLYPHICS are inscribed on the cave’s
walls. Zaya’s wrapped body is laid in state.
Thoth waves incense... The smoke does not rise. It burrows
into the earth...
THOTH
O thou who art Everlasting, send
your servant Anubis to guide the
dead to new life.
A PASSAGE OPENS in the SMOKY VEIL cloaking the floor...
ANUBIS
Rises. The intimidating guide to the Afterlife. A JACKAL’S
HEAD with fur black as the grave. A man’s body, taut and
sinewy. Yet his eyes are strangely calming, promising
absolute peace.
ON BEK. Unnerved...
Anubis nods to the gods, who return the courtesy.
Hathor puts her BRACELET on Zaya’s wrist.
BEK
You would give her that?
HATHOR
Of course.
Anubis touches the bracelet, and a SMOKY OUTLINE OF THE
TREASURE flows down into the passage...
ANUBIS
(to Zaya’s body)
She is made mighty before Ra. She
shall enter the hidden gate with
power.
Anubis reaches into the shrouded body as if it were
intangible, and PULLS OUT ZAYA by the hand.
ANUBIS
(to Zaya’s body)
You are released.
(CONTINUED)84.
CONTINUED:
At first glance, Zaya seems alive... but her skin has a smoky
movement to it as well...
BEK
Zaya --
But Zaya can’t hear him. She can only see that which lies
before her...
ANUBIS
The doors of earth are opened to
you.
Anubis leads Zaya DOWN THE PASSAGE opened in the floor...
The path tunnels into the darkness of ANOTHER DIMENSION...
TWELVE GATES mark the path -- ancient arches hewn from stone
older than time. Each Gate must be passed to reach the warm,
bright LIGHT at the end.
ON BEK. The light is beautiful, beckoning in the distance...
Anubis LEADS Zaya by the hand toward the First Gate...
ON HORUS, looking at Bek losing his love forever... There
must be something he can do... Maybe there is.
HORUS
Anubis, who directs your path?
ANUBIS
He who wears the crown of Egypt
rules all Egypt.
HORUS
If I take the crown from Set, I can
command you to turn back?
ANUBIS
If I have not yet escorted her
through the Twelfth Gate, she may
return. But no one may leave the
Afterlife once entered.
BEK
How long?
ANUBIS
The journey takes twelve hours, one
for every hour of the night.
HORUS
Do me a favor. Walk slowly.
(CONTINUED)85.
CONTINUED: (2)
ANUBIS
As slowly as I dare.
The smoke BLOWS AWAY, erasing the passage. Zaya is gone.
HORUS
(to Bek)
If Set is slain before Zaya reaches
her journey’s end, I can bring her
back to you.
ON BEK. A rush of determination. And hope.
EXT. RED DESERT - DAY
Horus, Bek, Hathor and Thoth trudge through a SANDSTORM...
Can’t see more than a few inches in front of them...
All at once the storm CLEARS as they reach the calm eye in
the center of this hurricane...
SET’S TEMPLE
A massive PYRAMID. It seems smooth and sharp-edged... but
it’s made of blood red SAND held together by Set’s magic.
The Pyramid’s surface is in constant motion, as if each grain
of sand were alive... The grinding movement is as deafening
as a waterfall.
They MOVE CLOSE enough for grains of sand to spit off and
bite their cheeks... but Bek can’t see any visible openings.
Then the sand parts, opening a DOORWAY into the Pyramid...
After a moment it’s erased. ANOTHER DOOR OPENS, then
CLOSES... A repeating invitation...
HATHOR
I was here once...
BEK
Did you go in one of those doors?
HATHOR
It was late. I was drunk.
Hathor would rather not talk about it...
HATHOR
Set told me to keep close or I’d
never get out. I thought I was
going to be crushed, but I followed
him to a big metal wheel...
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)86.
CONTINUED:
HATHOR (CONT'D)
He turned it, and just like that,
everything went still.
ON BEK. How to get in? The Pyramid’s doors continually OPEN
and CLOSE... Beckoning just long enough to seem like a real
option...
BEK
(to Horus)
How long have we got?
Horus focuses his eye beyond our earthly realm...
HORUS’ P.O.V. Zaya and Anubis walk under another arch on the
Afterlife path...
HORUS
She passes the Eleventh Gate. Be
quick.
Bek studies the pattern of doors opening and closing... He
sees the answer. Maybe.
BEK
Ever seen the shell game?
(they haven't)
We mortals use it to swindle coins
from fools. Three shells, pick the
right one and you win. Only you
can’t win. It’s fixed.
Bek hopes he’s right...
BEK
See you inside.
Bek IGNORES the opening and closing doors. Instead, Bek
SPRINTS straight at the Pyramid’s WALL --
Hathor grips Horus’ wrist -- she thinks Bek’s going to die --
Bek RUNS THROUGH THE WALL like a knife through a red wound --
INT. SET’S TEMPLE OF SHIFTING SAND
Bek’s in a cavernous, disorienting SPACE out of M.C. Escher’s
nightmares. Millions of tons of sand flowing in a mad
architecture of ARCHWAYS, STAIRWAYS and BRIDGES... Forming
into SOLID STONE for a moment... than reverting back into
rivers of sand.
Ahead, Bek sees THE WHEEL Hathor mentioned -- the mechanism
that shuts off the Pyramid’s shifting sand.
(CONTINUED)87.
CONTINUED:
The Wheel is the only thing not moving, attached to a solid
post like the steering wheel on a ship.
Bek feels a rush of euphoria. Maybe this is going to work --
The floor begins to DISINTEGRATE underfoot --
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS sails past... No time to think about it.
He LEAPS ONTO THE STAIRS... BOUNDS UP as steps MELT behind
him...
At the top, Bek has a choice between TWO identical BRIDGES
straddling the swirling space... But which one?
BEK
Roll the bones...
Bek SPRINTS onto one BRIDGE... as the other BRIDGE is SWEPT
AWAY in an eddy of sand. Lucky, lucky. He’s still alive,
but this is not sustainable.
Bek LEAPS from SOLID ROCK to SOLID ROCK... He glimpses the
Wheel through the flowing maze. Before it’s gobbled up
again, Bek JUMPS OFF THE EDGE --
ONTO A STONE ARCH. He holds on... riding the arch like a
wave. Just before it crumbles he JUMPS one last time...
FALLING through the red void --
Bek GRABS onto the Wheel for dear life. BUFFETED on all
sides... Bek won’t let go. He manages to CRANK the WHEEL --
All at once the sand of Set’s Pyramid turns SOLID --
Horus, Hathor and Thoth ENTER from a HALLWAY that‘s now just
normal stone.
HORUS
(slaps Bek on the back)
Well done.
THOTH
(cracks his knuckles)
Which way to the Sphinx?
INT. INNER CHAMBER - SET’S PYRAMID
Horus, Hathor, Thoth and Bek ENTER a great CHAMBER. Lit from
below by flickering FIRELIGHT.
Horus girds himself, spear raised... as SOMETHING HUGE
emerges from the shadows:
(CONTINUED)88.
CONTINUED:
THE SPHINX
Stares down. The head of an implacable man in royal
headdress, atop the fearsome body of a lion. Golden fur
rippling. Spiked tail swaying...
THE SPHINX
Trespassers in the house of the
king, answer my riddle or cease to
be.
Horus confronts the Sphinx himself.
HORUS
Why do you serve that murderous
backstabber?
THE SPHINX
A riddle for me, son of Osiris?
(answers matter-of-fact)
I serve the king.
HORUS
You were created to serve Egypt.
THE SPHINX
Egypt and the King are one.
(beat)
Now answer my riddle, or cease to
be.
THOTH
Go on. I’m waiting.
The Sphinx focuses its menace on Thoth. Asks its riddle:
THE SPHINX
I never was, am always to be.
No one ever saw me, nor ever will.
And yet I am the confidence of all
who live and breathe.
(beat)
What am I?
Seconds tick by as Thoth thinks... Horus, Bek and Hathor
wait...
THOTH
(with certainty)
Order. You are order.
The Sphinx ATTACKS Thoth, blindingly fast --
(CONTINUED)89.
CONTINUED: (2)
Horus GRAPPLES the Sphinx, fur in his fists, barely
preventing Thoth’s decapitation. Hathor and Bek dodge the
Sphinx’s WHIPPING TAIL...
HORUS
(to Thoth)
Try... again... please...
THOTH
That was a completely suitable
answer.
(to the Sphinx)
You are... purity.
Wrong. The Sphinx SLAMS Horus into the wall with earthquake
force.
Thoth racks his brain. Rattled now, off his game.
THOTH
“I never was, am always to be. No
one ever saw me, nor ever will.”
(stream of consciousness)
In the future. Nonexistent. Yet
it exists. Ephemeral. Imaginary.
Horus braces his forearm under the beast’s chin, JAWS inches
from his face... Its tail LASHES HIM... Horus can’t keep
this up long... Hathor and Bek can only watch...
THOTH
“And yet I am the confidence of all
who live and breathe.” Live and
breathe... Live and breathe...
BEK
Stop thinking like a god.
THOTH
(snaps)
Then I might as well stop thinking.
Thoth glances at Bek. Clarity coming...
THOTH
What is the confidence of mortals?
Their lives are so short, but their
hope remains undimmed for... for...
The Sphinx finally FLINGS Horus aside... It rears up, ready
to slay Thoth --
(CONTINUED)90.
CONTINUED: (3)
THOTH
(answers the riddle)
You are tomorrow.
The Sphinx sinks to all fours and TURNS TO STONE. Do we
detect relief on its face? Fairly defeated, it no longer
must serve Set.
THOTH
Ha! I am Thoth, God of Knowledge,
Master of Truth.
Horus advances to
A VOLCANIC PIT. It seems to go down forever. It is the
primordial fire that begat the desert sands...
Horus kneels at the edge and unslings his flask, filled with
WATER OF CREATION...
BEK
Do it.
Horus POURS the water into the pit... In moments, the fire
will be doused, and Set’s power with it...
But the water merely splashes onto SOLID GROUND. Wasted.
HORUS
(confused)
What?
Where’s the pit? The room seems to warp...
Horus staggers, his senses CONFOUNDED... Bek and Hathor are
DISORIENTED, too... Horus realizes they’re in a trap.
HORUS
He’s here.
ON THOTH. He stops short, stunned:
Set stands before him. He appeared out of nowhere.
SET
You are Thoth, God of Fools.
Set magically punches his hand though Thoth’s forehead and
pulls out his BRAIN. Thoth’s essence looks like smooth blue
LAPIS in Set’s hand. Thoth crumples, BABBLING NONSENSE.
Horus squints in Set’s direction... unable to get a bead on
him. Set’s POWER OF CONFUSION has addled his sight...
(CONTINUED)91.
CONTINUED: (4)
SET
(to Horus)
Thank you. You lured Thoth from
his library so I didn’t have to.
Set secures Thoth’s brain into its place on his HELMET.
SET
The final piece.
Set stands back and beholds his terrible masterpiece. The
ARMOR gleams with the spellbinding power of the gods.
HORUS
Why steal so much power? You’re
already stronger than anyone,
except...
(realizing, alarmed)
Ra.
For this is Set’s true target...
SET
Ra had two sons... but he only
granted one the power to give life.
(bitterly)
Unlike Osiris, I can never have a
child. My children are nothing but
wind and sand.
Horus has to snap himself out of Set’s spell... He slides
his palm down the BLADE of his SPEAR. Welcoming the PAIN...
SET
You are a failure, but at least my
brother had someone to seek
vengeance in his name. All I am
will end with me... So I choose
never to end. I will take Ra’s
place in eternity.
The pain allows Horus to see Set clearly:
Set seizes Hathor and drags her to the actual pit --
Horus THROWS HIS SPEAR at Set -- the best aim he can muster --
But it only glances Set’s cheek.
SET
(to Hathor)
I’ll miss the wine.
Set FLINGS Hathor OVER THE EDGE OF THE PIT --
(CONTINUED)92.
CONTINUED: (5)
HORUS
No --
Horus DIVES after her --
INTO THE PIT
FALLING... Horus GRABS Hathor, both plummeting toward the
FIRE at the center of the world.
Horus GRABS a jutting ledge of STONE. Horus and Hathor hang
on for their very existence...
HATHOR
(to Horus)
Don’t let go...
SET ABOVE THEM
Casually glances down... Horus hugs Hathor to his chest...
KICKS a TOEHOLD. JAMS FINGERS into STONE. He CLIMBS, inch
by inch... But it’s clear he’s already lost.
BEK
Leans his shoulder against Set’s armor, pushing it to the
edge of the pit... It totters precariously. Another shove
and it’ll fall in.
BEK
(to Set)
This important to you?
Bek has Set’s undivided attention.
SET
Stop.
(re: Horus)
Why would you fight a god’s war?
BEK
Maybe he’s my friend...
SET
Or maybe you have a deal with him.
(probing)
The girl who walks with Anubis?
Set can see he’s right.
SET
It’s too late.
(CONTINUED)93.
CONTINUED:
BEK
You’re lying.
SET
Look into the Eye.
Bek stares into the “Eye of Horus” GEMSTONE on the Helmet...
Its magic allows Bek to see into the beyond...
BEK’S P.O.V. Set is telling the truth. Anubis guides Zaya
through the Twelfth and final Gate. She DISAPPEARS into the
light of the Afterlife.
Bek is undone by sadness, the ARMOR SLIPPING in his grip...
SET
Spare my armor, and I will help
you.
BEK
(hollow)
You can’t.
SET
No King of Egypt can bring her
back, now or ever... But I can
make you wealthy enough to buy your
way into the Afterlife.
(beat)
Only there can you be reunited with
your love.
ON HORUS, down in the pit... still a long way to climb...
HORUS
(shouts up to Bek)
Don’t.
ON BEK. In the depths of despair, he makes his choice:
Bek pulls the armor back from the edge and gives it to Set.
SET
Unlike some, my oath is good.
ON HORUS. His anger at Bek blazes hot as the fire below.
HORUS
You white-livered mortal...
SET ABOVE
Stands beside Bek. Bek’s shoulders bow. A broken man.
(CONTINUED)94.
CONTINUED: (2)
Set waves his hand -- and a WALL DISSIPATES... Revealing a
HOARD OF TREASURE.
SET
My temple shall be your burial
chamber. Now you may pay Anubis,
and find the way open.
Set hands Bek a bejeweled DAGGER... Bek stares at it numbly.
SET
If you haven’t the stomach for it,
just wait a moment...
Set gestures at the roof. Obeying his spell, the Pyramid
SHUDDERS. In a few minutes it will collapse...
Set EXITS with his ARMOR.
ON BEK. Forlorn. Fine showers of sand already falling...
BEK
(bitterly, off the
treasure)
Always wanted a big funeral.
Bek positions the knife over his heart... None of this is
right and he knows it...
BEK
(to himself)
Just close your eyes and do it.
Bek puts everything out of his mind. Stop thinking about
what you’ve done... Countdown to suicide: three, two...
Horus SWATS away the knife before Bek can drive it in --
The Son of Osiris BURNS, wreathed in the FIRE of his anger.
HORUS
You denied me my vengeance...
HATHOR
Horus, don’t --
Horus SHOVES the treasure INTO THE PIT. It melts to
nothingness. With this vindictive act, Horus denies Bek the
Afterlife.
HORUS
(to Bek)
You will never see your love now.
(CONTINUED)95.
CONTINUED: (3)
Horus is surprised Bek does not rage back, or plead. But Bek
has something to get off his chest.
BEK
The night I lost Zaya to the
slavers, I didn’t know what to do.
I was lost. So I called out to
you. To save her. And me.
(beat)
Growing up, I thought you were the
bravest thing in all creation. So
I hated you for not coming to our
rescue.
Horus doesn’t know how to react to this...
HORUS
I didn’t hear.
BEK
No, you didn't listen.
A section of the ceiling falls behind them... Soon the whole
place will come tumbling down... Bek sits and waits to die.
BEK
(despairing)
I’ve finally learned the lesson of
the gods. We don’t matter to you.
Even if we wish we did.
ON HORUS. Profoundly moved. Here is this mortal, so fragile
and yet so strong. But the selfish actions of the gods --
especially Horus -- have crushed Bek’s spirit.
Horus’ anger subsides. The flames WITHER AWAY. Molten sand
cools to red glass.
HORUS
You do matter.
Horus humbly TAKES A KNEE before Bek.
HORUS
I am sorry.
ON BEK. Of all the improbable things he’s seen, Horus on
bended knee is the least likely.
HORUS
Perhaps one day you’ll forgive me.
(CONTINUED)96.
CONTINUED: (4)
BEK
We’ve both made mistakes.
Avalanches of sand COMING DOWN all around them now...
HORUS
Then there’s much we still must do.
But first, I swear you will not be
buried here.
Horus spots the GIANT WHEEL through crumbling walls... and
TEARS IT OFF ITS POST. Hathor scoops up Thoth’s body...
Horus holds the Wheel over their heads like a shield...
HORUS
Stay close --
The entire Pyramid of sand comes CRASHING DOWN around them --
ON HORUS, muscles straining against the thundering
downpour... Until we can see only RED.
EXT. GREAT OBELISK - HELIOPOLIS - SUNSET
The Great Obelisk stands like a colossal stone sword. Now
FINISHED, stabbing the heavens...
Set is pleased. Urshu, the Overseers, and thousands of
Slaves bow before him.
SET
(addressing the Slaves)
Your task is complete at the hour I
demanded. You have earned a great
honor.
Overseers force the Slaves INSIDE THE OBELISK...
SET
You will serve me for eternity.
Set slides a massive slab across the door, sealing them in.
INSIDE THE OBELISK
Slaves POUND desperately against unyielding stone. Enveloped
in DARKNESS. The Older Woman Slave drops to her knees...
OLDER WOMAN SLAVE
(praying)
Hail Horus, Son of Osiris, he with
golden eyes like the noonday sun.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)97.
CONTINUED:
OLDER WOMAN SLAVE (CONT'D)
We are your followers. Please
deliver us.
HOPELESS MAN
Why pray? He isn’t coming.
EXT. TOP OF THE OBELISK - SUNSET
At the Obelisk’s high peak, the evening sky’s purple canopy
is close enough to touch...
Set fastens his ARMOR. Dons his helmet. Extends his wings.
As the SUN dips to the horizon... Ra’s boat sails ABOVE him.
Set LAUNCHES himself off the Obelisk. FLIES like a GLIDER...
Air currents silently lift his wings through the darkening
sky, toward Ra’s boat...
EXT. RA’S BOAT - DUSK
Ra cranks out the last links of the chain to the sun...
letting his boat drift into DARKNESS. He stands at the bow,
spear ready...
Set LANDS quietly behind Ra... and pulls his cloak around
himself to conceal the armor.
Set gazes down at the shimmering NILE...
SET
(off the view)
It was never supposed to be so
green.
Ra turns at Set’s voice -- surprised to see him.
RA
Set. It must have taken great
effort to get up here. You always
were clever.
SET
How else could we speak? You do
not let your feet touch Egypt’s
sand.
RA
Your contendings with Horus are not
my concern. Leave me to prepare
for my nightly chore.
Movement in the deep as Ra’s boat nears the demon Apophis...
(CONTINUED)98.
CONTINUED:
SET
You have nothing more to say? Much
history has been written since last
we spoke.
RA
You came all this way to hear my
words? Hear them then, and carry
them in your heart.
(harsh)
If my feet were on Egypt’s sand,
Osiris would not have been the son
who died.
ON SET. It cuts deep, even after all that’s come to pass.
The echo of Apophis’ starved GROWL shakes the boat...
RA
(to Set)
Now go. The hour comes for me to
turn back chaos.
SET
Why?
Set brandishes his scepter... Ra turns on Set with fury...
RA
You raise your arm against me?
Ra STRIKES the upstart Set with a BLAST OF SOLAR FIRE from
his spear.
BURNING LIGHT envelops Set... Ra watches with emotion the
seeming death of his son at his own hand.
But as the light dims, Set REMAINS STANDING.
RA
No god could withstand that...
SET
I’m not just one god.
Set’s cloak has burned away, revealing the ARMOR beneath...
the jeweled body parts still hot with Ra’s light.
Set HAMMERS Ra with his scepter --
Ra tumbles OFF THE BOAT, stunned, into the OCEAN OF
DARKNESS...
(CONTINUED)99.
CONTINUED: (2)
SET
Apophis, quench your thirst.
The darkness UNCOILS...
EXT. RED DESERT - NIGHT
A FIST punches up from the sand...
Horus RISES, helps up Hathor. Bek behind them. They all
gulp in cool night air.
The STONE SPHINX is revealed, half-buried, rising from the
desert floor... Where it can still be seen to this day.
What looks like a BRIGHT STAR falls from the heavens... Ra.
HATHOR
(re: Set)
He did it.
At the far rim of the world, a BLACKNESS darker than night is
brewing...
INT. GREAT OBELISK - NIGHT
The Older Woman Slave still prays... Around her, moans and
the occasional sob. The air in the Obelisk is running out.
OLDER WOMAN SLAVE
(weakly)
Hail Horus, Son of Osiris... He
with golden eyes like the noonday
sun... We are your... followers.
Please...
From outside, a FIST hammers through the stone... LIGHT
pours in... Slaves blink at the radiance...
HORUS
(from outside)
I hear you...
OUTSIDE THE OBELISK
Horus smashes OPEN the DOOR...
HORUS
...and you shall be freed.
Bek watches the Slaves RUN OUT OF THE OBELISK... their faces
shining with gratitude.
(CONTINUED)100.
CONTINUED:
BEK
That was a great thing you did.
HORUS
I did what any king would do for
his people.
ON BEK. Did Horus just say “king?”
BEK
Thought you didn’t want to be king?
HORUS
(clasps Bek’s shoulder)
I just hadn’t gotten to know my
people.
Horus radiates a power and grandeur Bek’s never seen in him
before.
HORUS
(off the Slaves)
They won’t truly be free until
Set’s curse is cleansed from their
flesh.
Apophis’ infernal ROAR makes the ground tremble. Unnatural
night cloaks the horizon. This thing of nightmares travels
in a HAZE OF DARKNESS. Approaching fast...
BEK
What is it?
HORUS
Apophis. The Demon of Chaos. It’s
drawn to the Nile, the source of
all life.
BEK
Why?
HORUS
To drink it.
Bek looks around at lush, green Egypt... His home. He pales
at the thought of its destruction.
HORUS
Only Ra can banish Apophis.
(pointing)
But he needs that.
RA’S SPEAR sticks up from the center of an IMPACT CRATER.
(CONTINUED)101.
CONTINUED: (2)
HORUS
If we return his spear to him,
he’ll be revived.
The SOUND OF BEATING WINGS overhead...
Set DESCENDS from the sky... BLOCKING Bek and Horus from Ra’s
spear.
Set’s surprised Horus is alive -- but not that surprised.
SET
You could have gone peacefully into
the fire.
(to Bek)
And you rejected my gift.
Behind Set, Urshu leads a CADRE OF SOLDIERS to Ra’s Spear...
Urshu wrenches the heavy spear from the ground...
SET
(to Urshu)
Take it into the Obelisk. Ten
mountains-worth of stone will bury
Ra’s spear forever.
Urshu heaves Ra’s Spear over his shoulder, carries it TOWARD
THE OBELISK. The rest of the Soldiers flank their god...
...as Set readies his scepter to take on Horus.
HORUS
(to Bek)
Get the spear.
BEK
(off Set)
He’ll kill you.
HORUS
Not right away.
(a farewell)
You’re a good man.
Bek SPRINTS after Urshu...
Apophis’ ROAR rattles the world. The blackness blotting the
horizon takes SERPENTINE FORM...
Set comes at Horus, scepter swinging. Horus PARRIES --
But Set is stronger since they last fought. And Horus
weaker. The force of Set’s BLOWS knocks Horus to his knees.
(CONTINUED)102.
CONTINUED: (3)
SET
You overestimate yourself. I
suppose the son always becomes the
father.
HORUS
Not always.
Set cocks back for another brutal swing --
Suddenly Set’s own Soldiers attack him. Harmless, yet
distracting as a swarm of flies.
SET
(angrily, to his Soldiers)
What are you thinking?
HATHOR
Maybe they’ve finally realized what
a jackass you are.
ON HATHOR, nearby. She’s using her power of suggestion to
control Set’s Soldiers like marionettes.
Set KNOCKS ASIDE his mesmerized Soldiers... but it allows
Horus precious seconds to get to his feet...
HORUS
(to Hathor)
Get back --
Too late. Set SLAMS Hathor with his scepter. At the sight
of his fallen beloved, Horus’ rage explodes.
HORUS
If you’ve killed her...
Horus rushes to Hathor’s side. She’s alive, but unconscious.
SET
I won’t until I’ve had her one last
time. We’ll use your corpse for a
bed.
EMANATING HEAT, Horus CHARGES Set --
Set OVERTURNS a big URN from among the stockpile of building
supplies. LIQUID flows across Horus’ path...
It’s OIL. Set smirks. He’s baited Horus once again.
SET
Burn.
(CONTINUED)103.
CONTINUED: (4)
A flood of oil that could light a thousand lamps now splashes
across Horus’ scalding feet... His anger sparks a small
FLOWER OF FLAME. The fire licks the surface... GROWING...
Horus takes a breath. Bek’s words echoing in his head...
HORUS
(to himself)
Remember who you are...
Horus cools. To Set’s dismay, Horus presses his palm on the
growing flame... and EXTINGUISHES it.
SET
Aren’t you angry? Surely your
mother’s cries still echo in your
ears? Your father’s sundered
corpse still stains your mind?
HORUS
Today I’m not a son avenging his
father.
(beat)
I’m a king protecting his people.
SET
You’re not king yet.
Horus ATTACKS. Drives Set down a LOADING CANAL used for
ferrying blocks of limestone... All the way to the
DOCKS ON THE SHORE OF THE NILE
Hundreds of BOATS here -- all abandoned now.
Horus JABS Set in the chest. Set staggers... But in his
armor, Set cannot be harmed.
SET
Angry or calm, it makes no
difference. It’s too late now.
Horus watches in horror as the FOREST on the FAR SHORE
SHAKES... Trees uprooted...
THE DEMON APOPHIS
Slithers INTO THE NILE, sending WAVES crashing ashore...
A wall of water SWEEPS Horus and Set ONTO A SAILBOAT.
Apophis begins to DRINK the Nile. Its gargantuan MOUTH
sucking in water like a vortex into hell.
(CONTINUED)104.
CONTINUED: (5)
Horus and Set’s boat is PULLED AWAY FROM SHORE by the
current, along with EVERY BOAT ON THE RIVER...
INT. GREAT OBELISK - HELIOPOLIS
Bek ENTERS the Obelisk’s PITCH BLACK cavernous space...
He can hear Urshu’s FOOTSTEPS ahead... then the quiet echoing
of a CRANKED LEVER --
An ominous RUMBLE... Whether by machination, magic, or
both... the Obelisk is starting to FALL.
SHAFTS OF LIGHT angle through CRACKS in the miles-high
interior... As the light increases, Bek notices he stands
amongst ROPES ON PULLEYS, hanging like cables to the stars...
Bek spots Urshu in the center of the Obelisk... Urshu places
Ra’s Spear on the floor and awaits his doom...
BEK
You picked the wrong god to follow.
URSHU
Oh? Horus is out there dying.
Chunks of stone RAIN DOWN around them...
BEK
So will you.
URSHU
I’m the richest man in Egypt. Soon
I’ll be in the Afterlife. But
you’ll be nowhere.
Urshu grins at Bek as a massive piece of stone PLUMMETS down
at them --
Bek grabs a rope and SWINGS... PLUCKS Ra’s Spear off the
floor in the nick time --
Urshu is CRUSHED.
Bek, Ra’s spear in hand, runs for the EXIT...
HORUS AND SET ON THE RIVER
DUEL on the out-of-control sailboat...
Every time Apophis SWALLOWS, it pulls their sailboat a little
closer to its giant maw...
(CONTINUED)105.
CONTINUED:
HUNDREDS OF BOATS clog the river, all COLLIDING... A growing
LOGJAM drawn inexorably toward destruction...
Horus’ spear sends up SPARKS every time it glances off Set’s
impenetrable armor...
SET
Why keep fighting?
Horus is flagging... None of his blows matter.
A Galleon SMASHES into the sailboat, as boats PILE ON TOP OF
ONE ANOTHER in the diminishing space --
Apophis’ GAPING MOUTH rises over them like a black hole --
Horus TRANSFORMS into a Falcon... FLIES OFF THE SAILBOAT
just before it’s EATEN by the Demon.
Wings beating to ESCAPE the gale force draft, the Falcon
barely makes it --
BACK TO SHORE
A SCEPTER slams the Falcon OUT OF THE SKY -- wielded by SET
in his FLYING ARMOR.
The Falcon CRASHES... TRANSFORMING back into the shape of a
battered man.
SET
(savagely)
I want you to hurt. Because they
all loved you, no matter what you
did...
ON BEK. Watching helplessly...
Set hefts his Scepter two-handed... Brings it down upon
Horus with such force the earth SPLITS beneath him. Horus
lies stunned...
SET
No matter that you were not worthy.
Bek desperately RUSHES Set, a meaningless attack --
Set SEIZES Bek by the THROAT, holds the mortal close.
SET
You could have been in the next
life with a gentle breeze at your
cheek.
(CONTINUED)106.
CONTINUED:
BEK
I wanted to give you back your
dagger.
Bek STABS Set with the bejeweled dagger --
BEK
For Horus.
The dagger melts against the god’s armor like butter.
Set SWATS Bek aside with an awful crack --
Bek lands in a heap, fragile bones shattered. Horus kneels
by him.
HORUS
“For Horus?”
BEK
(painfully chuckles)
Too much?
They clasp hands. Brothers in this battle for creation.
Horus wheels on Set, raises his spear --
Set looks upon Horus... But something’s different:
Horus is looking at him with both his eyes.
ON BEK, smiling through the pain.
QUICK FLASHBACK:
Set’s eyes misdirected on the dagger in Bek’s right hand,
while the left snatches Horus’ eye from the helmet...
BACK TO SCENE
Alarmed, Set claws at his Helmet’s visor... There is a HOLE
where HORUS’ EYE used to be.
SET
No...
HORUS’ P.O.V. A clear shot at the chink in Set’s helmet --
Horus THROWS his spear --
This time, it flies RAZOR-STRAIGHT, cleaving Set’s head with
a burst of white fire.
(CONTINUED)107.
CONTINUED: (2)
Horus stalks to Set’s twitching body, tears off the armor,
and PULLS SET’S HEART FROM HIS CHEST.
HORUS
Go back to nothing.
Horus THROWS Set’s essence INTO APOPHIS’ HUNGRY MOUTH. As a
billion teeth gnash it...
Set turns to dust. His armor an empty shell...
The multitude of Slaves feel their skin HEAL, as their brands
vanish along with Set’s curse...
But the unquenchable Apophis keeps drinking...
Horus transforms into a FALCON... soars INTO THE SKY with
Ra’s Spear in its talons --
EXT. THE OCEAN AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD
Ra floats unconscious in the storm-tossed sea of darkness...
The Falcon Horus bites Ra’s shoulder... Ra’s eyes snap OPEN.
EXT. ALONG THE NILE RIVER - NIGHT
Ra DESCENDS in all his glory.
RA
Enough, beast.
Ra unleashes a STORM OF SOLAR FIRE from his spear --
Apophis BELLOWS, but this time in fear. The Demon RETREATS
across the horizon... Gone back to the darkness.
Horus rushes to Bek’s side... He’s dying. But he looks at
the world he’s saved with satisfaction.
HORUS
Are you sure you’re not a god?
BEK
What would I be the god of?
Stupidity?
HORUS
The Impossible.
Bek likes that... until the pain edges thought away. Bek’s
wounds finally overcome him. He dies.
(CONTINUED)108.
CONTINUED:
Horus bows his head in grief.
ANUBIS
My king.
Grim Anubis salutes the new ruler of Egypt.
ANUBIS
Command me as you will.
ON HORUS. It hadn’t occurred to him until now that the crown
is his... He gazes at the body of his fallen friend.
HORUS
Take him to his love.
EXT. THE PATH TO THE AFTERLIFE
Anubis guides Bek along the path, emptiness to his left and
right... Past the Twelfth Gate, the Afterlife beckons...
Bek leaves all the burdens of the past behind as he
gratefully STEPS INTO THE LIGHT.
INT. ZAYA’S TOMB - LATER
Horus sadly places Bek’s linen-wrapped body next to Zaya’s...
He feels a thrum of power as
Ra himself ENTERS. The tomb distorts around him -- for what
earthly room can hold the majesty of the sun?
RA
I have never been in debt. And yet
I am in debt to you, grandson.
(beat)
Ask whatever you will that we might
balance the scales. Mountains will
kneel before you. The winds will
do your bidding. Answer quickly,
for Apophis still hungers, night is
always coming, and my blade is
dull.
HORUS
Once I’d have taken such power for
myself...
(off Bek’s body)
But now I want nothing -- except
what’s impossible for me to give.
WE PUSH IN to Bek’s wrapped body...
(CONTINUED)109.
CONTINUED:
A BURST OF pure light and Ra is GONE. The room reshapes...
Bek sits up, bound in the linens. Horus unwraps his friend.
Bek looks around, trying to get his bearings...
BEK
Am I?
HORUS
Back? Yes.
(points)
You might want to help her.
Bek sees Zaya is similarly struggling to unwrap herself. Bek
unwraps Zaya... Her green eyes flash, alive and happy.
The lovers embrace. Together at last.
Horus gathers them both in a big bear hug.
HORUS
(greeting Zaya)
I’m Horus.
ZAYA
My lord...
Zaya bows to him, overwhelmed.
BEK
(to Horus)
I thought this was impossible?
HORUS
Impossible? Yes.
Bek smiles. Touche.
EXT. SET'S PALACE - DAY
A great CROWD. HUMANS from all walks of life. GODS of all
shapes and sizes. Everyone gathered for the coronation.
Behind the throne, Bek stands dressed in royal finery, Zaya
at his side.
All the major gods are present. Among them, Nephthys flexes
her restored wings...
Above, the sun shines. Squint and you can see Ra’s boat,
dependable as clockwork...
Thoth finally soaks up the sun’s embrace with pleasure...

Hathor gazes at Horus, beaming with love...
Horus kneels... as Isis places the Double Crown of Egypt on
his head. A reconciliation for mother and son.
ISIS
My heart is found.
Horus ADDRESSES the crowd...
HORUS
What happens to a man when he must
buy his way into the life after
death? He will lie, cheat, steal,
kill, and enslave to gather the
treasure he needs. And what of
those men who will never be rich
enough? If their cause is
hopeless, why would they act any
better?
(beat)
From this moment on, the Afterlife
must be earned not with gold, but
by good deeds, compassion and
generosity. To you who have little
worldly treasure, the door is now
open to you. To you who have much,
your riches will mean nothing when
you die.
(beat)
This life matters.
CHEERS for the King.
ON HORUS. He feels the North Wind softly blow... and he
knows that his father is proud.
BEK
(low, to Horus)
The day you finally make me rich,
you do this?
THOTH
(to Horus, peeved)
Just like that you’re changing the
rules of the Afterlife? Without
first consulting the God of Wisdom?
HORUS
Yes.
(CONTINUED)111.
CONTINUED: (2)
THOTH
This system will never work. Who’s
to judge whether a man is worthy or
not?
HORUS
You recognize truth, don’t you?
THOTH
Yes, but...
HORUS
You’re hired.
EXT. PATH TO THE AFTERLIFE
Urshu arrogantly passes through the Twelfth Gate on his way
to the Afterlife -- when Anubis STOPS.
URSHU
(to Anubis, irritated)
Have you not been paid?
Thoth blocks the path to the Afterlife.
THOTH
You need only answer my question
and I will judge its truth.
(beat)
Are you a good man?
URSHU
The best.
THOTH
The only one who believes that is
you.
Thoth jerks his head to Anubis, who TOSSES Urshu off the
path, into NOTHINGNESS.
EXT. HELIOPOLIS - DAY
All across Heliopolis, the PEOPLE are rebuilding... No
longer slaves.
HORUS AND BEK ON A BALCONY
Look across the Nile Valley... and beyond, at the encroaching
DESERT. They’re blown by a gritty gust of wind...
HORUS
I hate the sand.
(CONTINUED)112.
CONTINUED:
BEK
Get used to it.
Horus spots Hathor below, surrounded by admirers... She
won’t meet Horus’ eye even though she knows he’s watching.
HORUS
She’s in a mood. I can’t tell if
she’s mad I haven’t yet asked her
to be queen -- or if she’s mad that
I am going to ask her and she
doesn’t want a husband.
BEK
You want my counsel as Chief
Advisor to the King?
HORUS
Tell her about the first time I saw
her, right? Something about
sunsets...
BEK
Just go to her bedchamber.
(beat)
And bring the crown.
EXT. DESERT - DAY
THOTH’S VOICE speaks to us... Egypt looks like the arid land
we now know.
THOTH’S VOICE
And so Egypt was saved. But the
God of the Desert forever left his
mark on our once green paradise...
(sighs)
So much for our greatest creation --
which I suppose must now be Man, by
default. Perhaps in time you will
be ready to rule yourselves. Until
then, remember well as you travel
your path toward the Afterlife...
(beat)
Be good -- or I’ll know.
