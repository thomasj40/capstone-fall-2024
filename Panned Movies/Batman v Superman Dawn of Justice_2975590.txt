FADE IN:
EXT. ARCTIC OCEAN -- MORNING

TWO RUSSIAN WARSHIPS, the ANATOLE and the CASSIOPEIA,
approach a RUSSIAN OIL RIG in ARCTIC WATERS.

INT. BRIDGE, CASSIOPEIA -- CONTINUOUS

Karpov 60, an INTIMIDATING RUSSIAN GENERAL, CAPTAINS the
WARSHIP. His SECOND IN COMMAND UMINSKI, 30's, stands at his
side.

KARPOV
(to Uminski, in Russian)
Hold this position.

UMINSKI
Yes General.

INT. CARGO HOLD, RUSSIAN OIL RIG -- CONTINUOUS

300 RUSSIAN OIL RIG WORKERS are held PRISONER in the CARGO
HOLD of the RUSSIAN OIL RIG.

They are surrounded by a ATLANTEAN HIJACKERS. The Atlanteans
wear a combination of BLACK WET SUITS and ARMOR PLATING
designed like FISH SCALES. Their faces are CONCEALED behind
MASKS. Their HANDS and FEET are BARE. They wield STRANGE
WEAPONRY which HUM with ENERGY.

OKSANA, 40's, A HARDENED FEMALE OIL RIG WORKER cradles a
frightened YOUNGER FEMALE OIL RIG WORKER, LUCYA, early 20's,
who SOBS in her arms.

OKSANA
(in Russian)
It's Ok. It's Ok.

MERA, a TALL, BEAUTIFUL REDHEAD ATLANTEAN walks past them
and speaks with one of her Warriors. He BOWS to her and
leaves.

She walks towards a TALL MAN with LONG FLOWING hair who sits
on top of a stack of CRATES like a King on a THRONE. He is
dressed in ARMOR. In his right hand he holds a LONG GOLDEN
TRIDENT. His left hand is SHIMMERING and BLUE as if MADE OF
WATER.

This is ORIN, KING OF THE ATLANTEANS.
MERA
(in Atlantean)
Orin. The surface dwellers
approach.

Orin steps off the crates which are marked 'MERREVALE'.
ORIN
(in Atlantean)
Order the Warriors to set the
charges.

MERA
And the prisoners?

ORIN
They are pawns. When the charges
are set put them in their life
boats and release them.
(he smiles)
In the meantime let us welcome our
guests.

He leaves the Cargo Hold. Mera stays to watch over the
Hostages.

EXT. PLATFORM, RUSSIAN OIL RIG, ARCTIC -- CONTINUOUS

TWO RUSSIAN HELICOPTERS hover above the MAIN PLATFORM. A
SQUAD of TWELVE RUSSIAN COMMANDOES rappel down onto the
Platform their MACHINE GUNS raised and ready.

Orin emerges onto the Platform followed by a squad of his
WARRIORS who carry with them LARGE CANNON-LIKE WEAPONS.

ORIN
Get in formation. I'll attend to
these.

The King walks towards the Commandoes who AIM their GUNS at
him.

COMMANDO LEADER
(firmly, in Russian)
Drop your weapons and get down on
your knees!

ORIN
(in Russian)
I kneel before no one.

He SLAMS the HILT of his Trident DOWN.

A COMMANDO notices an Atlantean Warrior placing a CANNON the
RAIL at the EDGE of the PLATFORM and pointing it towards the
Warships.

COMMANDO
STOP!

The Commando FIRES his weapon. The Bullets BOUNCE of the
Atlantean armor but one PENETRATES the Warrior's leg. He
BUCKLES and FALLS to his knees.

With SUPERHUMAN speed Orin ATTACKS before the Commandos can
even REACT.
3.

He JUMPS high into the air and LANDS in the MIDDLE of the
Commandos.

With LETHAL EFFICIENCY he DISPATCHES the Commandos. SLICING
their ARMS and STABBING them THROUGH the LEGS with his
TRIDENT.

He KICKS the Commando Leader CLEAR ACROSS the platform as
the rest fall to the floor DISABLED and in PAIN but ALIVE.

The King turns to his Warriors and nods.

ATLANTEAN WARRIOR
OPEN FIRE!

The Warriors place the CANNONS on the RAIL and FIRE on the
Anatole.

BLUE BOLTS of DESTRUCTIVE ENERGY fire towards the Warship.
The Energy IMPACTS the HULLS of the Ship sending WAVES of
ENERGY through the vessel which INCAPACITATES the CREW who
CRUMBLE to the floor, UNCONSCIOUS.
INT. BRIDGE, CASSIOPEIA -- CONTINUOUS
Karpov sees the other Warship being DISABLED.
KARPOV
(to Uminski)
Call in the Fighters.

Uminski activates his radio.
EXT. SKY, ARCTIC WATERS -- CONTINUOUS

THREE RUSSIAN T-50 FIGHTER JETS fly high above the Arctic
waters.

INT. T-50 JET (FLYING), ARCTIC WATERS -- CONTINUOUS
The PILOT listens to his orders.

PILOT
What are my orders?

UMINSKI(0.S)
Request immediate attack. Terminate
the hostiles.

PILOT
Affirmit...

The Pilot pauses as he sees SOMETHING outside of the
COCKPIT.
4,
EXT. T-50 JET (FLYING), SKY, ARCTIC WATERS -- CONTINUOUS

Two FAMILIAR RED BOOTS walk up the NOSE of the Jet towards
the cockpit.

The Pilot looks up as a RED CAPE BILLOWS outside the Jet.
EXT. BRIDGE, CASSIOPEIA -- CONTINUOUS

Uminski and Karpov watch as the T-50 fly past without
completing the Airstrike.

UMINSKI
(into radio)
Request immediate attack. Repeat
Immediate attack.
There is no response

UMINSKI(CON'T)
No response sir.

Karpov SUCKS his teeth and PONDERS his options.
Uminski looks to the sky and his eyes WIDEN.
UMINSKI
(shocked)
Sir!
Karpov looks up.

INT. PLATFORM, RUSSIAN OIL RIG -- CONTINUOUS

Orin and his Warriors look to the sky as they hear the CRACK
of a SONIC BOOM.

A RED and BLUE BLUR CRASHES down through the COMPLEX.
ORIN
(smiles)
Sky Dweller.
INT. CARGO HOLD, RUSSIAN OIL RIG -- CONTINUOUS

The Red and Blue blur SMASHES down through the CEILING and
down onto the FLOOR.

The Hostages SCREAM and COWER as the Atlanteans raise their
ENERGY WEAPONS.

Mera CALMLY steps backwards and takes COVER behind a
BULKHEAD DOOR and WATCHES.

The DEBRIS and DUST settle and standing on the DENTED floor
in the middle of the Cargo Hold between the Hostages and
Atlanteans is the MAN OF STEEL, KAL EL... SUPERMAN.

An Atlantean Warrior RUSHES Superman with his Weapon RAISED.
SUPERMAN
(calmly)
I'd put those toys away.

Superman GRABS the BARREL of the Weapon and CRUSHES it with
EASE.

The other Atlanteans OPEN FIRE. BOLTS of CRACKLING BLUE
ENERGY strike Superman REPEATEDLY. He STAGGERS back as the
energy PASSES THROUGH his BODY. He SHAKES it off.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
(bemused)
That's new.

Superman tries to pull the Weapon away from the Atlantean.
But to the Kryptonian's SURPRISE the Warrior RESISTS.

The Warrior seems to be SMILING beneath his Mask.

Superman PULLS harder and the Atlantean is YANKED OFF his
feet entirely and TOSSED aside.

Superman then with SUPERHUMAN SPEED attacks the remaining
Warriors as they OPEN FIRE on his again.

He DEFLECTS their ENERGY BOLTS and DISARMS them DESTROYING
their Weapons and SCATTERING their parts across the Cargo
Hold.

He CRISS-CROSSES the interior of the complex SUBDUING the
Warriors before coming to a HALT in front of the Hostages.

They RECOIL from him and COWER

SUPERMAN (CON'T)

Don't be afraid.
(reaches out his hand)

I'm here to help.

Lucya stands up and walks up to the Man of Steel and looks
into his KIND EYES and places her hand in his.

LUCYA
(in English)
There are others.

SUPERMAN
I know. I'll take care of them. Can
you lead these people to the life
boats?

She nods. Superman smiles.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
(to Mera)
I'm giving you once chance to
surrender. That's more than those
Warships will.
ORIN(0.S)
(in English)
How many chances will they give
you?

Superman looks up through the HOLE in the Rig's Roof.
Standing above him LOOKING DOWN upon him is Orin.

ORIN(CON'T)
Before they kill you?

Superman LIFTS of the floor and FLOATS up through the hole
and HOVERS over Orin before LANDING to face him.

SUPERMAN
They only killers here are you and
your terrorists. Disarm the bombs
you've planted.

ORIN
I don't kill without justification.
(gestures to the
Warships)
Unlike them.

SUPERMAN
The people here are innocent.

ORIN
And I will release them and
(gestures to the rig)
destroy this abomination.

SUPERMAN
I can't allow you to do that.

ORIN

Their machines poison my oceans.
Ruin the Earth. There is nothing of
this world but rot, decay and
death.

(points Trident at

Superman)
And you would be it's champion?

SUPERMAN
I would be it's protector.

ORIN
Why? Humans hate what they don't
understand and they can never
understand someone like you.
(softly)
I know this.
SUPERMAN
You've been destroying oil
installations all over the planet.
This has to stop.

ORIN
I will never stop. I do this to
protect my people like you protect
theirs.

Superman sees Atlanteans on the Platform CHARGING up their
ENERGY CANNONS.

Before they can fire Superman uses his HEAT VISION to
DESTROY the Cannons.

The Warriors are sent HURTLING backwards from the BLAST.

Orin STRIKES Superman across the JAW with the HILT of his
TRIDENT and then STABS it toward his CHEST.

Superman CATCHES the Trident as Orin LUNGES forward DRIVING
Superman backwards.

Superman STEADIES himself. He looks at Orin's SHIMMERING
LEFT HAND.

SUPERMAN
(confused)
What are you?
ORIN
More like you than they can ever
be.

Superman GRIPS the Trident and SWING Orin over his head and
SMASHES him down INTO the Platform floor.

Orin FLIPS to his feet and SLICES the Trident ACROSS
Superman's CHEST cutting THREE SLASHES In his SYMBOL OF
HOPE.

Superman and Orin CHARGE at each other.

INT. BRIDGE, CASSIOPEIA -- CONTINUOUS

Uminski watches as Superman and Orin BATTLE on top of the
PLATFORM.

Karpov is on the radio awaiting orders.
UMINSKI
(to himself, in awe)
They are Gods!

Karpov receives his orders.
KARPOV
(to Uminski)
Open fire on the installation.
UMINSKI
(reluctant)
That would sink it. There are 300
civilians on board.

KARPOV
You have your orders.

Uminski takes a DEEP BREATH.
UMINSKI
(firmly)
No.

Karpov turns gestures TWO SAILORS to REMOVE Uminski from the
Bridge.

KARPOV
(disgusted)
Get this coward out of here!
Uminski is ESCORTED out.
KARPOV
(firmly)
Open fire!
INT. PLATFORM, OIL RIG -- CONTINUOUS

Orin is sent. SKIDDING backwards across the Platform. He
STABS his Trident into the FLOOR to stop his MOMENTUM.

He smiles.

ORIN
You're holding back.

SUPERMAN
Because I don't want to kill you.

The ROAR of ARTILLERY FIRE fills the AIR.

A SHELLS impact the Installation. The EXPLOSIONS SHAKE the
Oil Rig.

Another Shell DETONATES between Superman and Orin SEPARATING
them.

Superman JUMPS into the air and FLIES toward the Warship.
INT. BRIDGE, CASSIOPEIA -- CONTINUOUS

Karpov sees the Man of Steel approaching.
KARPOV
(frantic)
Fire! Fire! Fire!
EXT. ARCTIC WATERS -- CONTINUOUS
The Warship OPEN FIRE on Superman who PUNCHES the SHELLS
from the sky and FLIES over the Warship and uses his HEAT
VISION to DESTROY the ARTILLERY CANNONS and then DIVES down
through the BRIDGE.
Karpov THROWS himself to the floor on impact.

Superman stands over the TERRIFIED General. Before he can do
anything he HEARS the SCREAMING of the Oil Rig Workers.

He leaves and flies back towards the CRIPPLED Rig.

INT. HALLWAY, OIL RIG -- CONTINUOUS

He lands inside and lands in a SMOKING HALLWAY.

He HEARS someone STRUGGLING. He SWIFTLY follows the sound.

Mera is PINNED beneath a fallen BULKHEAD DOOR. Her STOMACH
has been WOUNDED. She's BLEEDING HEAVILY.

Superman LIFTS the DOOR off of her and TAKES her in his arms
and FLIES her out of the Hallway and out onto the Platform.

He lays her down gently.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
I can help you. Please trust me.

He uses his HEAT VISION to CAUTERIZE the wound. She GRITS
her teeth trying not to scream. Superman finishes and she
goes LIMP.

Superman looks up from Mera and sees Orin WATCHING him.
Behind him his Warriors stand WEAPONS READY and AIMED at the
Man of Steel.

Superman stands.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
She needs help. Take her and leave.

Orin STRAPS his Trident ACROSS HIS BACK and lifts Mera
GENTLY in his arms.

As he leaves he looks back on Superman for a moment.

Orin DIVES OFF the Platform and into the Ocean and SWIMS at
AMAZING SPEED into the DEPTHS. His Warriors follow.

Suddenly the 0il Rig is ROCKED by a huge EXPLOSION at it's
BASE and begins to TILT and SINK into the Ocean.
10.
INT. CARGO HOLD, RUSSIAN OIL RIG -- CONTINUOUS
Water RUSHES into the Cargo Hold and ENGULFS the Workers.

Oksana grabs Lucya and stops her from being DRAGGED away by
the CURRENT.

INT. PLATFORM, RUSSIAN OIL RIG, ARCTIC WATERS -- CONTINUOUS
Superman FLIES up into the sky then DOWN INTO the OCEAN.
INT. CARGO HOLD, RUSSIAN OIL RIG -- CONTINUOUS

The Workers are totally SUBMERGED and and SECONDS away from
DEATH.

The Oil Rig SHAKES and the Water levels begin to DROP. The
Workers GASP for air.

EXT. RUSSIAN OIL RIG, ARCTIC WATERS -- CONTINUOUS

The Oil Rig RISES from the OCEAN carried by Superman who
slowly carries it to the nearby ICEBERG and places it down
as SOFTLY as possible.

INT. CARGO HOLD, RUSSIAN OIL RIG -- CONTINUOUS

The Workers SCREAM as the Oil Rig LANDS.

EXT. RUSSIAN OIL RIG, ICEBERG -- CONTINUOUS

Superman BREATHS HEAVILY.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
Why are you here?

Orin stands behind him.
ORIN
Leave them. They will destroy you
if you don't.
Superman faces the King.

ORIN(CON'T)
It's their nature.

The Workers start to flow out of the Oil Rig.
Superman looks towards the Warships and walks past Orin.
SUPERMAN
You'd better hope we don't meet
again.
Superman LEAPS into the air and flies toward the Warship.

Orin watches him as he departs.
11.

ORIN
(respectful)
We will brother. We will.

INT. DECK, CASSIOPEIA -- CONTINUOUS

The CREW of the Warship, including Karpov and Uminski, are
on the deck.

Superman lands on the Deck and MARCHES toward Karpov.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
(angry) â
There were 300 innocent people on
that Rig!

KARPOV
(in Russian, terrified)
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry
Superman pauses.

SUPERMAN
(to Crew)
Does anyone speak English?

Uminski RAISES his hand.
SUPERMAN (CON'T)
Those people need help and medical
attention. See that they get it.
Uminksi nods and relays Superman's orders to the Crew.
SUPERMAN (CON'T)
(to Uminski)
Who ordered the attack?
Uminski doesn't say anything but LOOKS towards Karpov.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
Is that so?

CUT TO:
Karpov yells OBSCENITIES in Russian. He has been WRAPPED up
in the METAL REMAINS of the Warship's BRIDGE. His feet HANG
comically above the DECK.
EXT. RUSSIAN OIL RIG, ICEBERG -- CONTINUOUS

Oksana and Lucya watch as Superman disappears into the
heavens.

LUCYA
(in Russian)
Superman.
12.
EXT. SKY, ARCTIC WATERS -- CONTINUOUS

Superman flies HIGH above the Arctic PICKING UP SPEED as he
comes towards the PACIFIC OCEAN and skims at SUPER SONIC
SPEED across the water.

He SPINS as he gains ALTITUDE and enters the STRATOSPHERE,
BREAKING the SOUND BARRIER.

EXT. SPACE -- MOMENTS LATER

Superman SLOWS DOWN as he looks upon THE EARTH. He takes in
the sight for a moment before descending back towards the
UNITED STATES.

Floating in the distance is a LEXCORP SATELLITE.
INT. DARK ROOM

A MAN sits cross legged on a desk in a DARK ROOM with his
back to us.

He is a BLACK SILHOUETTE against an array of COMPUTER
SCREENS which are MONITORING the scene in the Arctic and
showing BLURRED IMAGES of Superman flying through space.

The screens go BLANK and the room goes BLACK.
EXT. BARN, KENT FARM -- EVENING

Martha Kent walks toward the BARN. Her dog jumps is by her
side.

She opens the BARN DOORS and enters. She tries to PULL OPEN
the TRAP DOOR when the Dog starts barking and she hears a
familiar SWOOSHING sound.

MARTHA
(smiles)
How come you always show up at
dinner?

Standing in the doorway is her son Superman... CLARK KENT.

CLARK
Good timing.

MARTHA
(sarcastic)
Sure
(tugs on the trap door)
Well don't just stand there. Help
me with this.

Her Son smiles and PULLS the trap door open and they both
walk down the steps into the DARK ROOM below.

Martha switches on the LIGHT and REVEALS the room which is
VERY DIFFERENT from when it used to conceal Clark's
13.
SPACECRAFT.

PASTED to the WALLS are HUNDREDS of NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS of
her son's EXPLOITS all around the world.

CLARK
You've been busy.

MARTHA
I come down her a lot these days.
I'm turning into your father.
(smiles)
When he wanted to be alone he'd
come down here. It was his fortress
of solitude.

Clark sees an OLD FRAMED PHOTO of himself and his FATHER on
the workbench. He picks it up and stares at it LONGINGLY.
It's clear he STILL misses him.

Martha leans her head against his shoulder and looks at the
photo.

MARTHA(CON'T)
He'd have been so proud of you
Clark. He was proud of you.

CLARK
I know.
(puts the photo back down
and looks around at all
the clippings)
If only the rest of the world
shared his opinion.

MARTHA
They will. They just don't
understand you right now. Or what
happened with Zod.

Clark's face HARDENS at the mention of Zod.

MARTHA(CON'T)
Look around you. Look at all the
great things you've done and the
people you've helped.

CLARK
But you've only put up the good
things they say about me.

MARTHA
Clark, honey. If I were to use the
bad things they say I could cover
the barn, the house and the
outhouse.

CLARK
We still have an outhouse?
14.
They laugh.

Martha HUGS Clark and lays her head against his TORN SYMBOL
of HOPE.

MARTHA
Things will change. Someday the
whole world will see you for what
you are. Just like I do. And your
Father did.

CLARK
When you say it I believe it.

MARTHA
That's right.
(loosens her grip and
looks him in the eyes)
Now let me fix you some dinner.

CLARK
That's Ok Mom.

MARTHA
Oh can it. We do this every time. I
already have a plate out.

CLARK
(laughs)
Ok. Ok.

She lets him go and starts to MARCH up the steps.
MARTHA
And take off that damn beat up
suit. No capes at the table.

CLARK
Elvis wore a cape. You love Elvis.

MARTHA

Elvis was Elvis. He could wear

anything.
Clark smiles and follows his Mother.
INT. KITCHEN, HOUSE, KENT FARM -- LATER
Clark, dressed in a SHIRT and JEANS, is in the KITCHEN
washing the dishes while Martha sits on the couch in the
living room watching a TALK SHOW.

MARTHA
Hurry up Clark. Lois is on.

Clark puts the final dish down and walks to the LIVING ROOM
and leans against the door frame.
15.

On the television TV talk show host CAT GRANT. A BUXOM
BLONDE with an ICE WHITE smile hosts a DEBATE between LOIS
LANE and MORGAN EDGE, a SLICK YOUNG PR EXECUTIVE.

INT. WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS
Cat SMILES at the CAMERA.

CAT
Good Evening. I'm Cat Grant and
joining me tonight on our panel is
Pulitzer Prize winning reporter for
the Daily Planet Lois Lane.

LOIS
Glad to be here Cat.

INT. LIVING ROOM, HOUSE, KENT FARM -- CONTINUOUS

MARTHA
(impressed)
She looks good on TV.

INT. WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS

CAT
And to her left is Morgan Edge, PR
executive to Metropolis' own
LexCorp. The world's leading
conglomerate and a virtual economy
all by itself. Lovely to have you
here.

EDGE
Always a pleasure.

CAT
So Lois I'll start with you. It's
been almost a year since the attack
on Metropolis and in that time you
have been a very vocal proponent in
the media for the being known as
Kal El as an ally to Earth.

LOIS
I believe Kal El is being portrayed
unfairly in the global media and as
a witness to what transpired before
and after the events in Metropolis
I have no doubt in my mind that Kal
El can and will aid humanity in
ways that I understand the
population are finding difficult to
accept right now.

CAT
Morgan, you and LexCorp have a
different view point.
16.

EDGE
We share the same view as the
majority of the world in that there
is no evidence that this 'Superman'
isn't a very real threat to the
safety of every single human life
on this planet.

LOIS
I disagree. Just look at the good
works he's done not just in the U.S
but around the world in the last
year.

EDGE
By good works do you mean breaking
international law and causing
incident after incident. Cat, just
tonight we are getting reports that
he attacked Russian Military
personnel in Russian waters.

INT. LIVING ROOM, KENT FARM --. CONTINUOUS
Martha looks at Clark.

MARTHA
You were in Russia? How was it?

CLARK
Angry.

INT. WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS

EDGE
(to Cat)

The Russian President is furious.
As long as we harbor Kal El it
looks like we are condoning his
actions. While he's flying around
dishing out his own brand truth and
justice the Russian government is
accusing us of aiding terrorists.
But Ms Lane would have you believe
that he's a hero.

LOIS
(to Cat)
The United States government
conceded that Kal El not only saved
millions of lives here in
Metropolis but also the entire
planet.

EDGE
Yet Ms Lane he couldn't save the
5,000 people that lost their lives
right here in our city. A death
(MORE )
17.

EDGE (cont'd)
toll that would have been much
larger had it not been for the
efforts of the city's police and
emergency workers. And what part is
Kal El playing in the
reconstruction of the city? None.
It is LexCorp that is fixing that
damage that he ultimately caused.

LOUIS
(dismissive)
This isn't a PR piece for LexCorp
Morgan.

EDGE
Just pointing out that your super
friend isn't the only one doing
good works.

LOIS
(to Cat)

Kal El possesses so much potential
as an ally of humanity rather than
being labeled an enemy. I believe
he's here to help despite what
people like Morgan would have you
believe.

MORGAN

(scoffs)
You say he's here to help but what
has he done? Lex Luthor has poured
over 5 billion dollars into the
city's infrastructure. Giving many
impoverished areas a new lease on
life including rebuilding notorious
slums like Hob's bay.

LOIS
And which is still and enclave of
violent criminal organizations
which fall under the protection of
LexCorp and their lawyers.

EDGE
There is no evidence of that and
you shouldn't concern yourself with
slanderous rumors.

LOIS
It isn't a rumor that you and Lex
where members of the most notorious
gangs ever to come out of Hob's
Bay.
18.

EDGE
It's no secret that life didn't
afford Lex and I quite the
opportunities that it did you Ms
Lane.

CAT
(interjects)
But look at Lex now.

EDGE
Exactly Cat. Lex Luthor and LexCorp
are the real heroes Metropolis
needs. Not some reckless Alien who
hides his true intentions from the
world.

INT. LIVING ROOM, KENT FARM -- CONTINUOUS

MARTHA
He does not like you.

CLARK
(smiles)
Seems like that.

INT. WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS
Cat smiles at the camera.

CAT
Well that's all we have time for.
After the break we will show you
exclusive report from our Russian
Affairs correspondent Angela Chen.
Lois thank you for joining us.

LOIS
Thank you.

CAT
And Morgan. Give my regards to Lex.

EDGE
Sure thing.

INT. LIVING ROOM, KENT FARM -- CONTINUOUS

MARTHA
I think she held her own.

CLARK
She always does.

MARTHA
Why haven't you brought her around
lately?
19.

CLARK
Because you both get way too drunk.

MARTHA
(indignant )
Whatever. You gonna stay the night?

CLARK
Sure. I got a doctors appointment
in the morning anyway.

MARTHA
Ok well take out the garbage before
you leave.

Clark KISSES his Mother on the cheek.

CLARK
Sure Mom.

INT. WGBS-TV STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS

Lois steps off the stage where Edge is having his MICROPHONE
REMOVED.

EDGE
Don't feel too bad Lane. TV is a
lot different than sitting behind a
laptop. This is where I shine.

LOIS
If you ever get tired of being
Luthor's mouthpiece then maybe you
can pursue a career.

EDGE
You know if you keep going after
him like this Lex might start to
take it personal.

Lois looks Edge right in the eyes.

LOIS
I couldn't prove the details of
Luthor's
(emphasises)
"aggressive aquisitions' of rival
companies. That doesn't mean I
stopped looking.

EDGE
That's usually when you should.

LOIS
Usually my sources don't end up
dead.
20.

EDGE
Life can be a fragile thing Ms
Lane.
(smiles)
Take care.

Edge leaves.

LOIS
(agitated)
Self important asshole.

She removes her CELL PHONE from her pocket and turns it on.
She has a TEXT FROM CLARK.

TEXT: In Kansas. Sleeping over.

LOIS
Of course.

YOUNG MAN(0.S)
Ms Lane.

Louis looks up from her phone and sees JIMMY OLSEN, a 21
year old PHOTOGRAPHER from the DAILY PLANET. He's BRIGHT
EYED, ENTHUSIASTIC and AWKWARD.

JIMMY
(nervous)
Mr White sent me down here to meet
you.

She looks at him, CONFUSED.

JIMMY (CON'T)
I'm Jimmy. Jimmy Olsen the new
photographer.

A flash of RECOGNITION crosses Lois' eyes.

LOIS
Right Jenny's brother.
(starts to walk)
I remember now.

Jimmy follows her periodically SKIPPING to keep up with her
STRIDE.

LOIS(CON'T)
Why are you even here?

JIMMY

(awkwardly)
Mr White sent me because you turned
your phone off and I was to tell
you not to say anything bad about
Lex Luthor. Which I didn't because
I left my damn I.D at home and they
wouldn't let me past the lobby.
21.
Lois smiles at him.

JIMMY (CON'T)
They had to call the Planet and by
the time I got here you'd already
said some stuff.

LOIS
Next time then.

AWKWARD silence.

JIMMY
So what now?

LOIS
I'm going home.

JIMMY
I could drive you. My car's
outside.

LOIS
I can get home by myself.

JIMMY
I was just asking because it's late
and all. For safety you know.

LOIS
I don't need a bodyguard Jimmy.
It's Metropolis, not Gotham.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY -- NIGHT

GOTHAM CITY is a vast URBAN SPRAWL. SKYSCRAPERS cast SHADOWS
over the DECREPIT SLUMS that SURROUND it's WEALTHY INNER
HUB.

EXT. STREET, GOTHAM CITY -- NIGHT

CARRIE, a 21 year old RED HEAD in THICK FRAMED GLASSES,
walks ALONE down the DARK Gotham street. She's frustrated,
her PHONE is DEAD and it's beginning to RAIN.

A CAB passes by. She raises her hand to hail it.

CARRIE
HEY! HEY!

It DOESN'T stop.

CARRIE(CON'T)
Asshole!
(she checks her phone
again)
Goddammit.
22.

She HEARS something. A NOISE from up ahead. She pauses,
SCANNING the area for any sign of DANGER. There's nothing.
Just SILENCE.

After a moment she looks to her phone again. On it's screen
she sees a FLASH of MOVEMENT.

She looks up but before she can react she is SNATCHED by an
UNSEEN ASSAILANT.

INT. ABANDONED THEATER -- CONTINUOUS

TWO MEN in DIRTY ORANGE JUMPSUITS drag Carrie, who is
KICKING and STRUGGLING, into the trash strewn ABANDONED
THEATER which is lit by a SOLITARY LIGHT. In the Theater
FIVE other MEN in identical jumpsuit huddle by that STAGE
beneath a SIXTH MAN, with ROWS of NOTCHED CARVED into his
EXPOSED TORSO, who sits atop a CHAIR on the STAGE like a
KING on his THRONE. This is SERIAL MURDERER VICTOR ZSASZ and
these are his ACOLYTES.

The five men part as Carrie is thrown roughly to the ground
in front of the stage. Zsasz looks down on her with MADNESS
FILLED EYES.

His Acolytes GRIN, GIGGLE and DROOL as their MASTER steps
off the stage and approaches the young Gothamite.

CARRIE(CON'T)
(frightened/whispering)
Please don't do this!

Zsasz smiles. SALIVA drips down his chin as he kneels down
and leans in close. Close enough for her to RECOIL from his
FOUL breath.

ZSASZ
(with relish)
You are whispering. My students
didn't bring you here to whisper.

Carrie's eyes BUG OUT when she sees the RAZOR SHARP DAGGER
Zsasz produces and brings it up to her CHEEK.

ZSASZ(CON'T)
No matter. You'll scream.

(nicks her cheek)
Soon enough.

Carrie KICKS her LEGS at the AMUSED Serial Killer. She is
RESTRAINED by the Acolytes.

CARRIE
(SCREAMS)
SOMEBODY! HELP ME PLEASE!
23.

ZSASZ
(smiles)
Good. Good.
(he licks the blood of
the blade)
That's a start.

Acolyte#1 notices SOMETHING above him. He looks up but
before he can make out what it is he is PULLED from the
floor and DISAPPEARS into the DARKNESS above.

Zsasz and his Acolytes FREEZE.

WHAM! CRACK! -- Acolyte#1 wails in PAIN before being SLAMMED
down into the ground HARD. He lays there UNCONSCIOUS and
BLOODIED.

A SHAPE descends from the DARKNESS above them.

Acolytes #2 and #3 have no time to react. Acolyte#2's knee
is BLOWN OUT as Acolyte#3's jaw is SHATTERED by a
devastating blow. Both me CRUMBLE to the ground.

Acolyte#4 SWINGS and IRON BAR at the SHADOWY FIGURE. He is
DISARMED and the bar is SLAMMED into his STERNUM. He falls
to the floor CLUTCHING his CHEST.

Acolyte#5 tries to RUN but the bar IMPACTS him across his
back SAVAGELY and he FALLS to the floor.

The DARK FIGURE steps into the LIGHT.

Carrie SCURRIES backward against the wall and sees the
SYMBOL. BLACK against GREY... A BAT.

Standing above the BEATEN and CRIPPLED bodies is GOTHAM'S
GUARDIAN, THE DARK KNIGHT... THE BATMAN.

His eyes NARROW as he focuses on his PREY, Zsasz. He steps
forward.

Acolytes #6 and #7 pull their BLADES and ATTACK.

#6's arm is SNAPPED like a TWIG. He tries to SCREAM but
can't as his face is SMASHED into the CONCRETE FLOOR.

#7 SWINGS WIDELY and the Batman effortlessly DODGES every
attack with GRACE and SPEED.

His reply is CRUSHING. Two BRUTAL STRIKES to the JAW and
finished by a STOMACH CHURNING KICK to the GUT which sends
#7 down. HARD.

ZSASZ(0.S)
(shouts)
STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

Zsasz holds Carrie CLOSE. His BLADE against her THROAT.
24.
ZSASZ(CON'T)
(menacing)
You move and I open her up!
Batman stands motionless, SILENT.

Zsasz smiles as he PRESSES the KNIFE against her SKIN. Light
GLITTERS across the BLADE.

CARRIE
(whispers/to Batman)
Please...
A RAZOR SHARP BATARANG appears in Batman's hand.

CARRIE(CON'T)
help!

Batman throws his weapon. His aim is accurate and it SLICES
across the MEAT of Zsasz SHOULDER, CUTTING him DEEPLY.

He SCREAMS. Taking the BLADE away from Carrie's neck.

She ELBOWS him in the CHEST and STUMBLES FORWARD holding her
THROAT.

Batman CATCHES her.

Zsasz clutches his MUTILATED shoulder and flees the Theater.
Carrie looks into Batman's COLD, EMOTIONLESS eyes. Her hand
slowly comes away from her throat. She's CUT. But
superficially.

He lets her go and FOLLOWS Zsasz out of the Theater.

She stands SILENT. Watching him in AWE.

EXT. STREET, GOTHAM CITY -- CONTINUOUS

Zsasz runs toward a PARKED VAN.

He opens the driver side door and gets inside. Sitting
SLUMPED in the passenger SEAT is a DEAD MAN. His THROAT has
been CUT.

In the back of the Van are TWO MORE ACOLYTES. Each have
MACHINE GUNS.

ACOLYTE#8
What happened?

ZSASZ
(seething)
The Bat.

They exchange WORRIED glances.
25.

Zsasz starts the engine and SLAMS his FOOT on the GAS. The
Van TEARS off down the street.

Batman APPEARS and produces a GRAPPLING GUN from his UTILITY
BELT. He AIMS at the Van and FIRES.

The Hook EMBEDS in the Van's REAR DOORS and Batman RETRACTS
the LINE and he is PULLED off his feet toward the Van. He
lands on the back of the Van and FLIPS onto the roof.
INT. VAN (MOVING) -- CONTINUOUS
Zsasz realizes that Batman is on the roof.
ZSASZ
(shouts to Acolytes)
He's on the roof!
The Acolytes OPEN FIRE through the roof of the Van.
EXT. VAN (MOVING), STREET -- CONTINUOUS
Bullets RIP through the Van's roof.
Batman NARROWLY avoids the GUNFIRE.
He PRESSES a BUTTON on his Utility Belt.
INT. DARKENED ALLEYWAY -- CONTINUOUS

The ALLEYWAY is PITCH BLACK until the GROWL of A POWERFUL
ENGINE is accompanied by the ILLUMINATION of TWO HEADLIGHTS.

INT. VAN (MOVING) -- CONTINUOUS
The Acolytes are RELOADING.
ZSASZ
(angry) |
Why won't he die!

Batman SLAMS DOWN onto the HOOD and PLANTS a SMALL EXPLOSIVE
on the WINDSCREEN.

It DETONATES and the screen SHATTERS.
Batman GRABS Zsasz by the THROAT.

The Acolytes FIRE on The Dark Knight. The Bullets TEAR
through his CAPE.

Batman releases Zsasz and RUNS up onto the roof as the
Acolytes fire at him through the roof.

Zsasz GRIPS his neck and looks in the SIDE MIRROR and sees
HEADLIGHTS in the distance behind him. Coming up FAST.
26.
EXT. STREET, GOTHAM CITY -- CONTINUOUS

Closing in the Van, ENGINE GROWLING, is an ARMORED BLACK
CAR. The BATMOBILE.

Batman JUMPS from the Van and LANDS on top of his Car as
it's door SWINGS OPEN and he JUMPS inside.

Zsasz Van picks up SPEED.

The rear doors SWING OPEN and both Acolytes OPEN FIRE on the
Batmobile.

Their bullets RICOCHET off the vehicles ARMORED EXTERIOR.
Zsasz takes a SHARP corner.

Acolyte#8 LOSES his BALANCE and FALLS from the Van. He SLAMS
into the asphalt and ROLLS limply down the street.

The Batmobile SWERVES HARD to avoid running over the downed
Acolyte.

Acolyte#9, unperturbed, continues to fire on the Batmobile.

Suddenly the Batmobile TURBO BOOSTS and OVERTAKES Zsasz's
VAN.

INT. VAN (MOVING) -- CONTINUOUS

Zsasz watches as the Batmobile passes him and VANISHES into
the night.

He eyes BULGE as ahead of him the Batmobile has come to a an
ABRUPT HALT.

He SLAMS on the BREAKS.
EXT. STREET, GOTHAM CITY -- CONTINUOUS

Zsasz's Van HITS the armored Batmobile HARD and JACKKNIFES
over it and CRASHES.

The Van SKIDS along the TARMAC sending SPARKS flying before
coming to a halt.

After a moment the Van door CREAKS open and Zsasz CRAWLS out
BLOODY and GROGGY.

He stands, leans against the Van and steadies himself.

WHAM! The sound of FIST against FLESH reverberates behind
him.

Zsasz turns.
The Batman stands by the RUINED Van holding the UNCONSCIOUS

Acolyte #9 by the THROAT. He releases his GRIP and the
Acolyte FALLS to the ground.
27.
The Dark Knight marches forward. His fists CLENCHED.
Zsasz pulls his BLADE and ATTACKS.

With LIGHTNING SPEED the Killer SLASHES and STABS at Batman.
The Dark Knight DODGES and PARRIES before GRABBING the
Killer's FOREARM.

BATMAN
(calm)
2 Men.

He BREAKS Zsasz's arm. The Killer SCREAMS.

BATMAN(CON'T)

(angry)
4 women.

He PUNCHES Zsasz in the STOMACH sending him to his knees,
COUGHING.

BATMAN(CON'T)
(angrier)
5 children.

He CRACKS him across the JAW.
Zsasz LAUGHS and SMILES through CRACKED, BLOODSTAINED TEETH.
ZSASZ
6...
(coughs)
6 children.
Batman's eyes fill with HATE.
He SNATCHES Zsasz's WINDPIPE and begins to SQUEEZE.
In a FRENZY he starts to RAIN DOWN BLOWS.
ONE -- TWO -- THREE--
His arm is GRABBED and YANKED back.
MAN(0.S)
(firmly)
That's enough!
Batman SPINS around and finds himself FACE to FACE with a
MAN, mid 20's, MASKED and DRESSED in BLACK with A DARK BLUE
BIRD SYMBOL on his CHEST. This is DICK GRAYSON, FORMER
ROBIN, now NIGHTWING.
NIGHTWING(CON'T)
(serious)

He goes back in cuffs. Not a
coffin.
28.

Batman UNCLENCHES his FIST and looks down on Zsasz's BLOODY
and SWOLLEN face.

Batman DROPS him.

The Serial Killer still emits SOFT LAUGHTER through his
BUSTED mouth.

SIRENS can be heard.

Batman PULLS his arm free of Nightwing's GRIP and marches
toward the Batmobile.

Nightwing watches him leave and DEPARTS before the G.C.P.D
arrive on the scene.

EXT. ROOFTOP, TALL BUILDING, GOTHAM --. LATER
Batman stands on the rooftop looking out into Gotham.
WAYNE TOWER can be seen in the distance.

NIGHTWING(O.S)
This has to stop.

Nightwing DROPS down onto the roof behind him and REMOVES
his MASK.

The FORMER ALLIES face each other.

BATMAN
(unrepentant )
It was less than he deserved.

NIGHTWING
(points his finger
accusingly)
You don't get to decide that. This
is not what we do.

BATMAN
It's always what I've done.

NIGHTWING
(angered)
Bullshit! What happened to the man
who would think things through
before beating someone to a pulp?

BATMAN
(emotionless)
He was weak. Lacked conviction.

NIGHTWING
So you're just going to keep this
up until what? You kill someone? Or
yourself?

Batman doesn't answer.
29.

NIGHTWING(CON'T)
We're not with you anymore. Not
Gordon. Not Barbara. Sooner or
later the law is going to come
after you.

BATMAN
(turns to leave)
I'll be ready for that.

NIGHTWING(CON'T)
(coldly)
Or I will.

BATMAN
(cold)
You do what you have to.

NIGHTWING
Maybe if you did what you had to
Jason would still be here.

Batman STOPS and SPINS around, ANGRY.

BATMAN
(shouts)
You have no right!

NIGHTWING
(shouts back)
I have every right.

BATMAN

(angry)
I TRIED!

NIGHTWING
(shouts)
YOU FAILED!

Batman has NO answer. Nightwing regains his COMPOSURE.

NIGHTWING(CON'T)
What you're doing won't change
that.
(turns to leave)
Stop. Before it's too late. You
don't belong out here anymore...
Bruce.

Nightwing leaves.

Batman is left alone to ponder his FORMER friend's
ACCUSATIONS.

He walks to the edge of the rooftop and removes his COWL
revealing the face of BRUCE WAYNE.
30.
He's in his early 40's but doesn't look a day beyond 35.
Except for his EYES which are OLD beyond his years. The eyes
of of WAR VETERAN who has seen TOO MANY HORRORS.
He looks at his BLOOD STAINED FISTS solemnly.
EXT. HOUSE, KENT FARM -- DAWN
It's the EARLY HOURS of the morning.

Clark, wearing his SUIT, steps out onto the PORCH carrying
TWO TRASH BAGS.

He walks towards the TRASH CANS.

Martha, in a BATHROBE steps out onto the porch. She SHIVERS
in the cold.

She pulls her robe tighter.

MARTHA
It's chilly.
Clark smiles.
CLARK
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake
you.
MARTHA

Then don't stomp down the stairs in
the A.M. I'd hoped you stay for
breakfast.

CLARK
I have to be back in Metropolis.

MARTHA
To see those quacks? I don't like
them poking and prodding you.

CLARK
(smiles as he puts the
bags in the trash cans)
They're friends Mom. No poking or
prodding.

MARTHA
If you say so.
(walks over and kisses
him on the cheek)
Take care. I'll see you soon.

CLARK
Can't go to the party without you.
I love you Mom.

MARTHA
I love you too.
31.

She steps back as Superman TAKES off and disappears beyond
the HORIZON.

EXT. MARINA, METROPOLIS HARBOR -- MORNING

THE THEMYSCIRIAN ROYAL SHIP slowly DOCKS in the METROPOLIS
MARINA.

I0, a TALL, ATHLETHIC WOMAN in her 20's, stands on the DOCK.
A RAMP descends from the Boat to the Dock.

At the top of the ramps stands a DEVASTATINGLY BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN, 20's, whose LONG LOCKS of DARK HAIR BLOW in the FALL
BREEZE. This is DIANA of THEMYSCIRA, PRINCESS of the
AMAZONS.

Io KNEELS as Diana descends the ramp.
10
(in Amazonian)
Princess Diana.
DIANA
(in Amazonian)
Stand Io. You do not have to bow to
me. I am not my Mother.
Io stands and Diana embraces her.

DIANA
It has been too long.

10
I wish we could meet under better
circumstances your Highness.
DIANA
I know. Tell me Io. Tell me what
has happened to Mala. Where is our
sister?
INT. MEDICAL CENTER, THEMYSCIRIAN EMBASSY -- LATER

An ELDERLY PRIESTESS stands over the SEMI CONSCIOUS body of
ORANA, an AMAZONIAN WARRIOR.

Orana has been SEVERELY wounded and is CLINGING to life.
Diana is led into the room by Io.
The Priestess BOWS as Diana approaches Orana.
The Princess CARESSES Orana's face.
DIANA

(to Io)
Who did this?
32.

10
Men came and stole our sisters
away. Only Orana returned to us.
Tortured and next to death.

Diana kneels beside Orana.

DIANA
Orana.

Orana's eyes struggle to focus.

ORANA
Diana?

DIANA
I am here sister. You must tell me
who did this?

ORANA
(weak)
They kept us in a tomb filled with
horrors.
(takes a labored breath)
Their King kept us prisoner.

Orana passes out.

DIANA
Rest sister.
(stands and turns to Io)
Who is this King?

10
The one who rules this place. The
city bears his mark. We should
never have come here. Its a world
ruled by animals.

Diana looks at her fallen fellow Amazonian.

DIANA
We are here because your Queen
commands it. We need to find where
our sisters are being held.

10
There is one who will give us the
location.

Io gestures to the Doorway where Morgan Edge stands,
GRINNING.

EDGE
(cocky)
I may not understand the lingo but
I figure you might be wondering
where the other lady is being kept.
33.

DIANA
(in English)
And you would tell us?

EDGE
Sure. For the right price.

DIANA
I won't barter for life of one of
my sisters.

EDGE
Then your sister won't have life
much longer.

Suddenly A GOLDEN LASSO is WHIPPED around Edge's neck and he
is PULLED to his knees.

The Lasso begins to GLOW with GOLDEN ELECTRICITY.
Edge's EYES begin to GLOW

DIANA
Is my sister alive?
EDGE
(hypnotic)
Yes.
DIANA

Where do they keep her?
EDGE
Lexcorp Research and development.
Three miles south outside the city
limits.
Diana REMOVES the Lasso.
Edge holds his neck.
EDGE(CON'T)
(confused)
What did you do to me?
DIANA
I let you live.
(to Io)
Get this beast out of my sight.
Io picks Edge from the floor and escorts him, ROUGHLY, out.
Diana GRIPS the Lasso TIGHT with BOTH HANDS.
EXT. S.T.A.R LABS, METROPOLIS -- DAY

S.T.A.R LABS is a HUGE CIRCULAR BUILDING located near the
METROPOLIS HARBOR.
34.
INT. HAMILTON ROOM, S.T.A.R LABS -- CONTINUOUS

The MAIN LABORATORY is a VAST room littered with COMPUTER
MONITORS and SCIENCE EQUIPMENT beneath a GIANT SKYLIGHT.
SUNLIGHT fills the room.

HEAD SCIENTIST PROFESSOR SILAS STONE, 50's, is compiling
DATA on his TABLET.

T.O MORROW, a SCIENTIST in his 50's sits at his computer
screen monitoring SATELLITE FEEDS. He notices something on
his screen.

MORROW
(to Silas)
He's here.
SILAS

Good. Open the skylight.

Morrow presses a few keys on his computer and the GLASS ROOF
opens up.

MAN'S VOTCE(0.S)
He's late.

Silas turns and smiles at COLONEL JOHN STEWART. A TALL,
BROAD SHOULDERED FORMER MARINE. His UNIFORM is EMBLAZONED
with a S.T.A.R Labs logo on his SHOULDER.

STEWART
You need to tell him to keep to the
schedule if we don't want the
higher ups to find out about our
arrangement.

SILAS
I'm sure he has his reasons.

STEWART
I'm sure we'll hear about it on the
news.

HOVERING just above the Skylight is Superman. He floats down
into the middle of the room.

SUPERMAN
(to Silas)
Professor Stone.
(to Stewart)
John.

STEWART
Kal.

Silas notices the DAMAGED suit.

SILAS
Long night?
35.

SUPERMAN
Long year.
STEWART
(annoyed)
You where scheduled over an hour
ago.
SUPERMAN
(apologetic)

Sorry. I had dinner with my Mom.
Silas smiles. Stewart RAISES an EYEBROW.

SILAS
Follow me.

Superman follows Silas through the Laboratory and towards a
RESEARCH CENTER.

Morrow walks over to Stewart and hands him a Tablet.

MORROW
Take a look at this.

Stewart looks it over. It's a NEWS ARTICLE.
IT READS: SUPERMAN ATTACKS RUSSIAN TROOPS.

STEWART
(weary)
Swell

INT. RESEARCH CENTER, S.T.A.R LABS -- CONTINUOUS
Superman is SHIRTLESS and laying on a TABLE.

Attached to his CHEST are ELECTRODES which send INFORMATION
to Silas' MONITOR.

SILAS
(in awe) )
It's amazing.

SUPERMAN
What is?

SILAS
Kryptonian physiology. So different
yet so similar to our own. I can
never get used to it.

SUPERMAN
(smiles)
Took me 30 years.
36.

SILAS

Your vitals are perfect. Heart
rate, blood pressure, brain
activity. All perfect. Yet still
you haven't tapped your full
potential.

(turns off the monitor)
There is so much we can learn from
you. So much that could benefit us.

SUPERMAN
Not everybody shares that
enthusiasm.

SILAS

Not everybody has vision Kal or can
see past their fears. Which is
understandable. Once the gods were
above us and now they walk among
us. It's a frightening concept for
most.

SUPERMAN
The ones who are attacking the oil
rigs. They're not like me but
they're not like you either.
Something else entirely. I know
it's hard to believe.

SILAS
I believe you.

Silas sits down beside the Man of Steel.

SILAS(CON'T)
Not everything remarkable on this
Earth comes from elsewhere.

SUPERMAN
What do you mean?

SILAS
That we are at a dawning of a new
age. An age of Gods and Monsters.

SUPERMAN
You're not frightened.

SILAS
Not when you stand for us.

Silas stands and puts his hand on Superman shoulder.
Superman puts his hand on his.

SILAS(CON'T)
Come on. I have something to show
you.
37.
INT. RED ROOM, S.T.A.R LABS -- CONTINUOUS

Superman follows Silas to through the RED ROOM. A TOP SECRET
section of S.T.A.R Labs that houses varying kinds of
EXPERIMENTAL TECHNOLOGY.

SUPERMAN
What is this place?

SILAS
This is the Red Room. It's where we
keep our advancements that for
whatever reason the greater public
isn't quit ready for yet.

They come to a LARGE CONTAINMENT CAPSULE.

SILAS(CON'T)
Here it is.

Silas inputs a code into the KEYPAD on it's side. It opens
with a HISS.

Inside is a BLUE BODY SUIT.

SILAS(CON'T)
It's a prototype for a new space
suit. Highly durable yet very
flexible. We'll have to make a few
changes but I'd like you to have
it.

SUPERMAN
I can't accept this. You've already
taken too many risks.

SILAS
You have to.
(gestures to the tears in
Superman's suit)
We can't have the savior of the
world in rags.

SUPERMAN
(concedes)
Thank you Silas.

SILAS
We'll have it finished before I
leave for Washington. I do wish
you'd come with me. Speaking to the
President would help your cause.

SUPERMAN
I want to address the Leaders of
the World as a whole before I speak
to them individually.
They walk

38.

SILAS
I understand.
(He closes the Capsule)
The Conference. Do you think you're
ready?

SUPERMAN
I think so. It's been a year. At
this point they will have to accept

me.
SILAS
Still hopeful I see. And if they
don't?
SUPERMAN

Well that's up to them. I'll
continue trying to help regardless.
Will you be there?

SILAS
Of course. I was hoping to bring my
son but he has other things on his
mind.

SUPERMAN
The big game?

SILAS
Every game is a big game to Victor.
I suppose it has to be when your a
quarterback.

towards the exit.

SILAS(CON'T)
I'd imagine you'd have made quite
the player yourself.

SUPERMAN
My Mother wouldn't let me.

SILAS
Afraid you'd hurt someone?

SUPERMAN
She was afraid they'd hurt me.

SILAS
(laughs)
I don't think there's anything out
there that can hurt you.

INT. CLONING FACILITY, PROJECT CADMUS -- DAY

PROJECT CADMUS is a large UNDERGROUND LABORATORY.

PROFESSOR

SASHA FEDEROV, a CHECHNYAN SCIENTIST, stands in

front of a giant INCUBATION CHAMBER which is a REVERSE

Are you out of your damn mind?

INT. PERRY WHITE'S OFFICE, DAILY PLANETS OFFICES, LEXCORP
PLAZA -- CONTINUOUS

PERRY WHITE, the EDITOR IN CHIEF, SLAMS a STACK of PAPERS
down on his desk. He's PISSED.

Lois stands in front of him, DEFIANT.

PERRY (CON'T)
You go after Lex Luthor on national
television? What the hell were you
thinking?

LOIS
(unrepentant )
It was a debate. I was defending my
position.

PERRY
By slandering Metropolis' favorite
son? How do expect to rally support
from the public when you're trying
to crucify Metropolis' favorite
son?

LOIS
Morgan Edge has been taking every
opportunity to turn what happened
into a PR stunt for Lexcorp. All on
the basis that Kal is a threat to
the world.

PERRY
And he isn't?

LOIS
You know he isn't.
40.

PERRY
I know what he did for us. I also
know what happened despite that.
People are still scared and if you
want to change that pursuing old
grudges isn't the way to do it.

LOIS
It's not about that.

PERRY
It's been about that for the last 5
years Louis. Let it go.

LOIS
My investigation got a man killed.
Would you let it go?

PERRY

(sighs)
You can't touch him Lois. Nobody
can.

(he turns and stares out

the window in deep

thought )
I grew up in Hob's Bay Louis. I
know the type of person that
survives a place like that. what
that person is capable of.

(turns back to Lois)
Luthor runs the show. It's not by
chance were in a building he owns.
At anytime he could buy the Planet
right out from under us. You keep
this up and he will bury us. You
can't fight this battle on two
fronts.

Lois weighs Perry's comments.

LOIS
(reluctant )
I'll back off. For now.

PERRY
(firmly)
For good.
(takes his seat)
I want you to cover the Conference.

LOIS
I told you I won't.

PERRY
It's non negotiable Lois. It's the
largest gathering of world leaders
this city has ever seen. And they
are here to see Superman. You have
to be there.
41.

LOIS
This isn't fair Perry.

INT. BULLPEN, DAILY PLANET OFFICES, LUTHOR PLAZA --
CONTINUOUS

Clark, wearing his GLASSES, sits at his desk eaves dropping
on Perry and Lois' conversation with his SUPER HEARING.

Jimmy sits on the desk beside him eating a bowl of nachos.
Jimmy is talking but Clark isn't paying attention.

JIMMY
Clark?

Clark realizes that Jimmy has asked him a question.
CLARK

Sorry Jimmy I zoned out there for a
second. What was that?

JIMMY

I asked have you seen him up close?
CLARK

who?
JIMMY

Who do you think? Superman. I been
talking about him for the last 5
minutes. Honestly buddy you need to
get your hearing checked.

CLARK
No. I didn't start working until
after the whole thing.

JIMMY
Damn. I want to see him in action.
You know last month he stopped a
cruise liner from sinking.

Clark turns his attention back to Perry's office where he
can see Lois and Perry's ARGUMENT getting very HEATED.

CLARK
(disinterested)
Sounds neat.

Lois STORMS out of Perry's office, SLAMMING the door behind
her. EVERYONE in the bullpen STOPS and STARES.

CLARK(CON'T)
Lois?

LOIS

(angry) |
Not now Smallville!

Clark stands, grabs his coat and CHASES after Lois. He
clumsily BUMPS into people as he does.

CLARK
(awkward)
Sorry! Sorry!
EXT. STREET, LUTHOR PLAZA -- CONTINUOUS
Clark catches up with Lois as she exits the Plaza doors.
CLARK
(concerned)
Hold on. Whats wrong?

Lois stops.

LOIS
Don't pretend that you didn't hear
everything.

CLARK
I thought it would be more polite
to ask.

LOIS

This is such a bad idea. Someone
else needs to cover that
Conference.

CLARK
It's not like you to be afraid of a
few world leaders.

LOIS
I don't need to watch you get
crucified by a bunch of scared
bureaucrats. Are you sure about
this?

CLARK
No.
(smiles)
But I have to try.

She HUGS him tight laying her head on his chest. He WRAPS
his arms around her.

CLARK(CON'T)
We'll figure this out.

LOIS
I know.

Fly me to Cancun?

CLARK

CLARK(CON'T)
My Mother's coming into town.

LOIS
(genuine)
Really?.
CLARK

That's not an excuse to get
liquored up.

LOIS
Your Mother's a bad influence.

CLARK
You influence each other.

They laugh.

CLARK(CON'T)
I want to take her to the Spire
opening.

LOIS
I don't know why you even want to
go to Luthor's Ball.

CLARK
Mom's a country girl she's never
been to a high society event. She'd
love it. Plus it's an excuse to
wear a suit.

LOIS
Clark Kent in a suit? I can't
imagine it.

He smiles before his ATTENTION is drawn to a CROWD of PEOPLE
that are GATHERED near a WALL. He stops.

Lois looks CONCERNED.
LOIS
(solemn)
Clark don't.
Clark gives her a PAINED look and walks toward the crowd.

He makes his way through and sees the wall is COVERED by
HUNDREDS of PHOTOS and KEEPSAKES.

It's a MEMORIAL to the LIVES LOST a year before.

Clark SCANS the wall. He sees MEN... WOMEN... CHILDREN...
FATHERS... MOTHERS... SONS... DAUGHTERS.

The TURMOIL is evident on Clark's face.
Lois TOUCHES his arm gently.

LOIS
Clark?

CLARK
(overwhelmed)
There's so many.

LOIS
(softly)
I know. Come on.

Clark takes one last LOOK over his shoulder as Lois LEADS
him away.

INT. OVAL OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE -- DAY

The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DIANE NELSON, a tall,
slender woman in her 50's, sits behind desk. Her SERIOUS
eyes drifting back and forth between the three people
sitting in front of her.

GENERAL SWANWICK, Head of the UNITED STATES NORTHERN
COMMAND, sits to her right along with Silas Stone and to her
left is...

AMANDA WALLER, a STERN and FOCUSED SENATOR with an
INTIMIDATING PRESENCE.

PRESIDENT NELSON
So what are our options?

WALLER
Honestly very few. The world is
watching our every move on the
Superman. We have to take a
definitive action.

PRESIDENT NELSON
Which is?

WALLER
(forthright)
Engagement.

SWANWICK
I must advice against this course
of action. Superman has in my
opinion more than proved himself as
an ally.

WALLER
(to Swanwick)

He's proved himself as a liability.
(MORE )
45.

WALLER (cont'd)
(to President)
Russia is pushing for some sort of
action and if we don't act now we
risk looking weak.

PRESIDENT NELSON
What do you suggest?

She hands her a THICK FILE stamped: CADMUS
The President FLIPS through it.

PRESIDENT NELSON(CON'T)
What am I looking at here?

WALLER
Last year we recovered several
items from Metropolis after the
attack. Two items in particular. An
advanced incubation system and a
body. Which Cadmus Cadmus has
managed to successfully duplicate
the Alien D.N.A

The President looks INTRIGUED. Swanwick looks SURPRISED.

PRESIDENT NELSON
Which means?

WALLER
Which means Ma'am why worry about a
Superman when we can have our own.

SILAS
(to Waller)
You and I both know the results of
Cadmus are inconclusive at best.

WALLER
(dismissive)
I have assurances from the head of
the project Professor Sasha Federov
the worlds foremost authority on
genetic engineering that a subject
is ready for field testing.

PRESIDENT NELSON
Does S.T.A.R Labs have any
alternatives?

SILAS
We are researching several courses
of action. None of which involve
weaponizing alien technology.
46.

WALLER

(to Swanwick)
Courses of action that are leading
to nothing.

(to President)
Mrs President the world is
changing. I and I'm sure S.T.A.R
Labs have been monitoring several
occurrences all over the world. The
attacks on oil platforms by
terrorists whose technology is
something we have never encountered
before. Reports of an entity in
Central City that moves faster than
sound. Cadmus can counter these
very real threats. All we need is
your signature.

The President PONDERS her decision as she reads the file.

PRESIDENT NELSON
Why am I only hearing about this
now?

WALLER
Up until a few months ago there was
nothing to tell. Just research,
experimentation, no concrete
results.

PRESIDENT NELSON
Who's. funding this project?

WALLER

Several different institutions.
SWANWICK

I must advice against this Mrs

President.

PRESIDENT NELSON
(to Swanwick)
I had the Russian President on the
phone for over three hours this
morning General Swanwick. We need
solution and I believe Ms Waller
has provided us with one

Waller smiles SELF SATISFIED.

PRESIDENT NELSON
I can't give you a definitive
answer until after the conference.
but as of now...
(places the file on her
desk)
You have my support.
47.

WALLER
Thank you Mrs President.

INT. HALLWAY, WHITE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Stewart stands outside the Oval Office doors.
The doors open.

Waller leaves the Office followed by Swanwick and Stone.

SWANWICK
_ (angry)
This is unacceptable Amanda.
WALLER
I'm just doing what you would in my
position.
(turns to Silas and
smiles)

Don't presume to think that I'm
unaware of the Alien's relationship
with S.T.A.R Labs Professor Stone.

SWANWICK
Cadmus is a mistake.

WALLER

Cadmus will make sure that Superman
will think long and hard before
acting against our interests. The
game has changed. There's a living
weapon patrolling our skies and
it's about time we had our own.

(turns away and walks

down the hallway)
This is an arms race and I intend
to win.

Swanwick is FRUSTRATED.
STEWART
(to Swanwick)
Who's your new girlfriend?

SWANWICK
Amanda Waller.

STEWART
So that's the 'Wall'?

SILAS
Who's funding Cadmus?

SWANWICK
I have no idea Silas.
48.
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - LATER

Stone and Stewart leave the White House grounds and walk
towards a waiting CAR and DRIVER.

Standing by the Car is a Silas' Son VICTOR STONE. A STAR
QUARTERBACK. He wears a METROPOLIS UNIVERSITY JACKET.

STEWART
(concerned)
We need a strategy Silas.

SILAS
I know John. I didn't see this
coming. Cadmus is off the books.

STEWART
Black Ops?

SILAS
No. It's privately funded. And
that's whats worrying me.

STEWART
The only person with that the
resources is...

SILAS
A big problem John.

Victor opens the back passenger seat for his Father.
STEWART

(to Victor)
How's the arm Vic?

VICTOR
Like a cannon.
STEWART
Better be I got money on you.
VICTOR
Then you'll be buying the drinks
after man.
SILAS

Come on Victor.
Victor gets in beside his Father and closes the door.
SILAS(CON'T)
(to Stewart)
I'll see you in Metropolis.

The Car pulls off.
49.

EXT. LEXCORP ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER,
METROPOLIS OUTSKIRTS -- NIGHT

A LEXCORP HELICOPTER LANDS on the HELIPAD atop the SPRAWLING
LEXCORP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMPLEX located just
outside the CITY LIMITS.

The Complex is HEAVILY GUARDED by ARMED LEXCORP SECURITY
GUARDS who stand at each CORNER of the Helipad.

MERCY GRAVES, late 20's, a STRIKING WOMAN in a BUSINESS
SUIT. steps out onto the Building where she is greeted by
BRUNO, the HEAD of SECURITY, who is FLANKED by TWO SUITED
SECURITY GUARDS.

BRUNO
(faux politeness)
It's always good to see you Mercy.

MERCY
(smiles)
A pleasant lie Bruno, but a lie
nonetheless.

BRUNO.
Well I tried.

MERCY
And like everything in your life
you'll have to try a little harder.

BRUNO
So why are you slumming it with the
grunts?

MERCY
I'm overseeing the disposal of the
material.

BRUNO

I see. Well better you than me.
Don't wait on around on my account.

He gestures toward the HELPIPAD ENTRANCE.

Mercy enters the the Complex. Bruno and the Suited Guards
follow.

A HOODED and CLOAKED FIGURE DASHES at AMAZING SPEED through
the GROUNDS and JUMPS HIGH through the air and lands ON TOP
of the COMPLEX in the MIDDLE of the Helipad.

Before the Guards have time to REACT the Figure STRIKES,
DISARMS and INCAPACITATES them.

The Figure REMOVES her hood to REVEAL Diana in a SLEEK BODY
SUIT as the WONDER WOMAN.
50.

INT. HALLWAY, LEXCORP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER --
CONTINUOUS

Mercy, Bruno and the Guards walk down the STERILE WHITE
HALLWAY followed by the Security Detail.

SUDDENLY the LASSO is WRAPPED around Bruno's NECK and he is
DRAGGED backwards OFF HIS FEET.

Mercy turns to see Bruno SMASH VIOLENTLY into the WALL at
the end of the Hallway.

Wonder Woman TAKES OUT the Security with TwO SWIFT KICKS.
They SLAM into the walls and to the FLOOR UNCONSCIOUS.

MERCY

_ (angry) .
You just made the last mistake of
your life.

Mercy PULLS a GUN which Wonder Woman WHIPS out of her hand.

Like LIGHTNING Mercy ATTACKS the Amazon with a series of
PUNCHES and KICKS which are all BLOCKED.

Wonder Woman COUNTERS with a KICK to Mercy's GUT which sends
her backwards.

Mercy, DEFEATED, tries to RUN but CLUTCHES at her THROAT as
the Lasso WHIPS around her neck. It GLOWS.

WONDER WOMAN
(menacing)
You hold one of my people prisoner.

MERCY
(hypnotic)
Yes.

WONDER WOMAN
Take me to her.

INT. SUB BASEMENT, LEXCORP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CENTER
-- CONTINUOUS

Mercy, still under the Lasso's THRALL, stands with Wonder
Woman outside the GLASS DOORS of a LABORATORY deep beneath
the Research Center.

WONDER WOMAN
Open it.

Mercy places her hand on a SCANNER beside the door. It
RECOGNIZES her PALM PRINT and the doors SLIDE OPEN.

Wonder Woman PUSHES Mercy inside.

Inside the room is a LIQUID FILLED TANK where MALA, late
20's, FLOATS UNCONSCIOUS.
51.

A SCIENTIST, 40's, STANDS SHOCKED as he watches Wonder Woman
DRAG Mercy towards the Tank.

WONDER WOMAN
(to Scientist)
Release her!

SCIENTIST
(frightened)
I can't!

The Amazon WHIPS the Lasso from Mercy who falls to her knees
and around the Scientist's NECK.

SCIENTIST(CON'T)
(hypnotic)
I can!

The Scientist operates the Tank and the liquid is DRAINED
from it.

The Tank OPENS and Wonder Woman RUSHES to CATCH Mala before
she FALLS to the floor.

WONDER WOMAN
Mala!

Mala's eyes SLOWLY OPEN.

MALA
(in Amazonian, groggy,
confused)
Diana?

WONDER WOMAN
(in Amazonian)
I've come to take you home.

She LIFTS Mala of her feet CARRYING her out of the
Laboratory.

After she leaves Mercy, holding her throat, turns to the
cowering Scientist.

MERCY
(horse)
Why are you standing there. Sound
the alarm!

EXT. LEXCORP RESEARCH CENTER, METROPOLIS OUTSKIRTS --
CONTINUOUS

The ALARMS are RINGING throughout the Complex.

CRASH!!! -- the ENTRANCE DOORS SHATTER as TWO SECURITY
GUARDS are TOSSED through them.

Wonder Woman EMERGES from the Entrance CARRYING Mala in her
ARMS.
52.

She RUNS at INCREDIBLE SPEED away from the Complex as GUARDS
on the Roof OPEN FIRE on her.

When she comes to the PERIMETER FENCE she JUMPS over it,
CLEARING it by 40 FEET.

She LANDS and VANISHES into the NIGHT.

Mercy appears on the Roof, SEETHING as she RUBS her neck.
EXT. RIVER, METROPOLIS OUTSKIRTS -- CONTINUOUS

Wonder Woman lays Mala down a RIVER.

WONDER WOMAN
Rest Sister. You're safe now.

MALA
(frail)
He wants to kill him. He hates him
so much.

WONDER WOMAN
Who? Who are you talking about?

MALA
He wants to kill their New God. He
wants to kill the Superman!

EXT. WAYNE MANOR -- NIGHT
Wayne Manor is a HUGE 19th CENTURY ERA MANSION.
INT. HALLWAY, WAYNE MANOR -- CONTINUOUS

ALFRED, 70's, is an ELDERLY but still very SPRY BRITISH
BUTLER walks down the hallway towards Bruce Wayne's STUDY
carrying a tray of food. Inside he approaches an ANCIENT
GRANDFATHER CLOCK and TURNS the hands to 10:48 then -- CLACK
-- the clock UNLOCKS and PULLS AWAY from the wall revealing
a HIDDEN DOORWAY. He enters. The Clock RETURNS to it's
original position behind him.

INT. BATCAVE -- CONTINUOUS

Alfred walks down a STONE STAIRCASE illuminated by a series
of LIGHTS on the ROCK CEILING above. BATS SCREECH past over
head as he descends further down into the VAST CAVERN.

THE BATCAVE is huge. Housed inside the vast EXPANSE is an
array of HI-TECH GADGETS and WEAPONRY. Old now, showing
signs of WEAR and TEAR after YEARS of use.

Alfred passes the parked Batmobile.
In the back of the Cave sitting atop a LANDING PAD is the

BATWING. A JET which is covered in DIRT and DUST from years
of IDLENESS.
53.

Alfred makes his way up a set of steps to an ELEVATED
PLATFORM where Bruce Wayne sits in front of THREE LARGE
COMPUTER MONITORS. Each screen tells a different news story.

RIGHT SCREEN: SERIAL KILLER VICTOR ZSASZ APPREHENDED.

MIDDLE SCREEN: SUPERMAN ATTACKS RUSSIAN TROOPS.

LEFT SCREEN: U.N CONFERENCE TO MEET ON ANNIVERSARY OF K-DAY.
Bruce is FOCUSED on the MIDDLE SCREEN.

Alfred puts the tray on the desk beside the computer
screens.

ALFRED
I brought you some dinner Master
Bruce. One must never obsess on an
empty stomach.

Bruce glances at the food but doesn't reply.

Alfred looks at the images on screen and sees Superman
HOVERING above Metropolis in SHAKY AMATEUR FOOTAGE.

ALFRED(CON'T)
If the criminals of Gotham are
lacking your interest might I
suggest turning your attention to
Central City's rogues before
tackling an alien.

Wayne still doesn't reply.

ALFRED(CON'T)
(weary)
Try and eat something.

He turns to leave.

WAYNE
I saw Grayson.

Alfred STOPS when he hears the NAME.

WAYNE(CON'T)
He's turned his back on me. They
all have.

ALFRED
(honestly)
He's turned his back on the part of
you that reminds him of what we've
lost.

WAYNE
He hates me.
54.

ALFRED
It's not hate Master Bruce it's
hurt. He mourns the brother and
blames the father.

WAYNE
And who do you blame?

ALFRED

I blame the one who took him. Not
the one who loved him.

(Alfred puts his hand on

Bruce's shoulder)
But I do regret the loss of a man
who sought diplomacy over violence.
I miss that man.

(beat )
Everything's ready for your visit
to Metropolis

He SQUEEZES Bruce's shoulder before leaving.

Bruce is still for a moment before standing and walking over
to a LARGE GLASS DISPLAY CASE.

Inside the case is a DARK RED and BLACK TACTICAL ARMOR
(CHEST PIECE, GLOVES, BOOTS) which stands beneath a DARK
GREEN HOODED CLOAK and a BLACK FACE MASK.

Bruce places his hand on the glass and stands for a moment.
His WEARY eyes filled with the HURT of a FATHER who has lost
a SON.

INT. CORRIDOR, PROJECT CADMUS INSTALLATION -- DAY

The HALLWAY is DARK. ELEVATOR DOORS open ILLUMINATING the
Hallway.

Amanda Waller steps out and walks down the Hallway towards
two HUGE REINFORCED DOORS. Her footsteps ECHO as she does.

When she arrives at the door she faces A CONTROL PANEL. She
SPEAKS into it.

WALLER
(into control panel)
Waller, Amanda. Clearance MOS 17

The Reinforced Doors OPEN UP slowly revealing the CLONING
FACILITY.

Waller steps inside and the doors close behind her.
Federov, SURPRISED, rushes toward her.
FEDEROV

Mrs. Waller. I wasn't aware you'd
scheduled a visit.
55.

WALLER
I didn't. I'm here in an unofficial
capacity. I wanted to get a closer
look at what we're making here.

Federov nods, SHEEPISHLY.
Waller walks toward the Incubation Chamber.

WALLER(CON'T)
When will it be ready?

FEDEROV
On schedule.

WALLER
This project is a big risk Federov.
I can't afford any mistakes.

FEDEROV
I promise you our subject will be
perfect. It's my finest work.

WALLER
Show me.

Federov presses a few BUTTONS on the Chamber's CONTROL PANEL
and the screen RAISES revealing its CONTENTS.

Waller is visibly UNIMPRESSED by the Creature.

WALLER
It doesn't look like much to me
Federov.

FEDEROV

Relatively speaking neither does
Superman but then again you're not
here for aesthetic.

WALLER
I'm here for results which this...

FEDEROV
(with pride)
Ultimate.

WALLER
Ultimate can provide.

FEDEROV
Trust me. You won't be
disappointed. The Ultimate is
superior to the Superman in every
way.
56.

WALLER
It had better be if and when the
Alien goes rogue.
(leans in close to look
at the Creature)
I've seen enough.

Federov closes the Chamber.

FEDEROV
General Swanwick has been demanding
access to the Project.

WALLER
Swanwick is a fool. A decrepit
relic that can't see beyond the
barrel of his gun. He thinks. he has
his weapon and doesn't want anyone
else to have theirs.

FEDEROV
He does have authority.

WALLER
The only authority here is me
Federov. I'll deal with Swanwick
you focus on getting your Ultimate
operational.

She starts to walk towards the doors.

FEDEROV

So what to I tell him?
WALLER

Only what you're allowed to.
FEDEROV

Which is?
WALLER

Nothing.

EXT. STREET, LEXCORP TOWER -- DAY

A M.C.P.D PATROL CAR is parked outside of LEXCORP TOWER, a
HUGE SKYSCRAPER.

Sitting in the Car is OFFICER JAMES HARPER, a BROAD
SHOULDERED COP in his 40's. The passenger door opens and his
partner GUY GARDNER, an ATHLETIC MAN in his late 20's. He
has COFFEE CUPS and DONUTS.

GARDNER
That's a strong black coffee for me
and...
(hands Harper his cup)
And a decaf green tea for Grandma.
57.

Harper takes the cup.

HARPER
Witty.

GARDNER
Donut?

HARPER

No thanks. I brought a salad.

Harper opens up a CONTAINER full of LEAFY GREENS and GRILLED

CHICKEN.

A LEXCORP

GARDNER
Suit yourself.

VAN passes them. Harper looks at it with DISDAIN.

HARPER
Would you look at that. He's
everywhere.

GARDNER

(eating his donut)
who?

HARPER
Who do you think? Luthor. He's got
his damn trucks and billboards
everywhere.

GARDNER
It's always been like that Jim. Far
as I remember.

HARPER
Not always Guy. It just sticks in
my throat how a little punk like
that can end up with everything. I
must have busted him and his
cronies a dozen times. Never could
get anything to stick. Bastard was
always to smart for us.

GARDNER
He's put a lot of money into
Metropolis.

HARPER
Considering how much he's taken out
of it it's only right. You want to
know how he came by all that cash?

GARDNER
Sure I could use a few pointers.
58.

HARPER
When he was just some brat on the
street him and his punks ran a
protection racket down in the Bay.
Bed good folks dry. He takes that
cash and uses it to make a computer
program then sells it to big firm
out west for a billion.

Gardner WHISTLES at the number.

HARPER(CON'T)
It gets better. He then uses that
cash and makes a better program
makes the one he made first look
like a calculator. Turns that
billion into billions.

GARDNER
Sounds like good business.

HARPER
That's not the point. Point is he
got his start by taking out of the
pockets of decent people. Guys a
crook and the whole damn world
loves him.

GARDNER
He's rebuilding th city after those
aliens blasted it.

HARPER
He's still a crook. Just a rich
crook.

GARDNER

I'll take him over Superman any
day. Better the devil you know Jim.

HARPER
You been watching the box? He's
been doing a lot of good out there
in the world.

GARDER
That'd be fine by me if he stayed
away from Metropolis. I don't like
that space man flying around here.
Aliens weirds me out.

A BLACK LIMO pulls up outside the LexCorp buildings MAIN
ENTRANCE.

GARDER(CON'T)
Who's this now?

Alfred steps out of the Limo and opens the Limo passenger
door and Bruce Wayne emerges dressed in a EXPENSIVE SUIT.
59.

HARPER
(surprised)
That's Bruce Wayne.

GARDER

unimpressed
who?
07

Alfred gets back into the Limo while Wayne walks enters
LexCorp tower.

INT. LOBBY, LEXCORP TOWER -- CONTINUOUS

Wayne walks through the Lobby and stops when he notices
there is a BASKETBALL COURT located to his right. HIP YOUNG
TECHNICIANS and COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS WALK back and forth.

Mercy awaits the Billionaire Gothamite. She has a SCARF
around her neck to CONCEAL her BRUISES.

She reaches out her hand to Wayne.

MERCY

(perky) .
Mercy Graves. Assistant to Mr.
Luthor. It's a pleasure.

Wayne takes her hand and cracks a smile.

WAYNE
The pleasure is all mine.
(points to the court)
Nice decor.

MERCY
(smiles)
A perk for the minions. Lex
believes a entertained workforce is
a productive workforce.

WAYNE
Nice policy.

MERCY
Effective policy.

She leads Wayne towards the GLASS ELEVATOR BANKS. They step
inside and Mercy presses the TOP FLOOR.

The Elevator lifts off.
As the lift climbs Wayne observes each floor.

Many of the Floors are filled with ROWS and ROWS of COMPUTER
MONITORS each manned by a YOUTHFUL TECH GENIUS.

WAYNE
I remember when LexCorp was a
warehouse by the Bay.
60.

MERCY
Lex's goal has always been meeting
ones potential. He believes LexCorp
is an example to which everyone can
strive to.

The Elevator comes to a halt and the doors slide open and
Wayne steps into the SPACIOUS 125th floor PENTHOUSE.

The ROOM is HUGE and ROUND bordered BY WINDOWS which offer a
PANORAMIC view of Metropolis. A BALCONY jutts out of the
side of the Penthouse.

Wayne steps inside and the doors close behind him.

Sitting CROSS LEGGED on his desk in front of an ARRAY of
COMPUTER SCREENS is the RICHEST man on the PLANET, ALEXANDER
"LEX' LUTHOR, 30, the C.E.0 of LexCorp. He is one part TECH
GENIUS, one part RUTHLESS business man and two parts
METROPOLIS STREET TOUGH. His SHAGGY MANE of HAIR hangs below
his eyes and a detailed SLEEVE TATTOO of the METROPOLIS
SKYLINE creeps up his right arm.

His EYES say it all. Behind them BURN the FIRES of
UNPARALLELLED GENIUS. A POWERFUL INTELLECT enabling him to
accomplish anything he bends his will toward. Within the
boundaries of his mind he is GODLIKE.

Wayne observes the IMAGES that captivate the youthful
billionaire... THE MAN OF STEEL.

LUTHOR
Look at it. So sleek. So powerful.
WAYNE
He's an impressive specimen.
LUTHOR
'It' Wayne
(shifts around to face
him)

It's an alien. And a trespasser and
it doesn't belong on this planet.
Perhaps you share my view?

WAYNE
Superman isn't the reason for my
being in Metropolis.

LUTHOR
Your reason being Metropolis
itself.

WAYNE

I can't help but take an interest
in the city's tragic circumstances.
61.

LUTHOR
(half smiles)
And profitable circumstances.

WAYNE
Neither of us would have gotten to
where we are if we didn't look at
the bottom line.

LUTHOR
I got to where I am through hard
work and innovation. You by
accident of birth. I assure you we
view our bottom lines very
differently.

He HOPS of his desk and walks past Wayne to a BAR near the
ELEVATOR. In comparison Luthor is much SMALLER that the
POWERFULLY BUILT Gothamite. Yet his CONFIDENCE more than
matches Wayne's stature.

Luthor reaches into the FRIDGE and removes and ENERGY DRINK.

LUTHOR(CON'T)

(cracks open the can)
I'd offer you a drink but I don't
have any gingerale.

WAYNE
We both want the same thing Lex. To
help Metropolis. Our past
differences shouldn't get in the
way of that.

LUTHOR
(takes a gulp)
Past differences? As I recall you
called me an amoral, arrogant brat.

WAYNE
Yes on the very same day you
launched your first satellite.

Luthor smiles.

WAYNE(CON'T)
And a cyber attack crippled mine.

LUTHOR
(smirks and leans back
against the Bar)
Coincidence Wayne. The world is
full of it.

WAYNE
Apparently so. Took us quite a
while to get it operational again.
62.

LUTHOR
I liked that satellite. It was
quaint. Whatever happened to it?

WAYNE
An alien in a black onesie kicked
it out of the sky.

LUTHOR
(amused)
Ouch.

WAYNE
I'm here to help. The rebuilding of
Metropolis is my main priority.
Pooling our resources would better
serve it's citizens. I'm willing to
let bygones be bygones. If you are?

LUTHOR

An alien spacecraft blasted a hole
in the city where I was born. I'm
not about to let a few limp insults
from a trust fund baby overshadow
that.

(finishes his drink and

crushes the can)
Do you really think you would have
gotten past the lobby if I was
holding a grudge.

WAYNE
I'm glad we can put it aside. I
don't think either of us relishes
continuing this war for contracts.

LUTHOR

(dismissive)
Wayne enterprises is a powerful
company but not enough to challenge
me in my own backyard. I am
LexCorp. LexCorp is Metropolis.
Those contracts are mine. But
despite your company's limitations
there are things I can use it for.
It'll allow me to focus on more
important matters.

Wayne looks back at the monitors.

WAYNE
Superman?
LUTHOR
(irritated)

It's not a man. It's an alien. And
by the time the world finally
absorbs that this...

(MORE )
63.

LUTHOR (cont'd)
(gestures out of the
window towards the
ruined sections of
Metropolis)
. could happen again.

Wayne look out on the RUINED and IN REPAIR structures. His
face reflects his CONCERN for the City.

WAYNE
What would you suggest?

LUTHOR
When a dog bites a man we put it
down. Because we understand what
it's capable of. That thing isn't
one of us and doesn't deserve the
understanding that the government
is affording it.

WAYNE
You sound like you want to kill
him?

LUTHOR
There comes a time when even a god
must die.

WAYNE
You've seen what he... 'It' can do.

All that power. All that strength.

LUTHOR
It might be hard for someone like
you born with the silveriest of
spoons to understand. I spent my
childhood on the streets. I joined
a gang. It's survival. I didn't
have much of a choice. I learned
there that there was always someone
bigger, stronger but never smarter.
By the time I was 15 that gang
answered to me. Strength is nothing
Wayne. Resolve is everything.

WAYNE
Then why not use that resolve to
find a peaceful solution.

LUTHOR
There is no peaceful solution with
an trespasser.

WAYNE
How about one that doesn't involve
you going toe to toe with a god.
64.

LUTHOR
(amused)
Toe to toe? I don't go toe to toe
with anybody. You don't become the
general by charging the frontlines
with the rest of the troops.

WAYNE
Too smart for that?

Luthor raises and eyebrow and smiles.

WAYNE
I'm glad you reconsidered and
alliance.

LUTHOR

I'm not usually one to second guess
myself but you don't become a
billionaire at 18 by ignoring the
bigger picture.

(walks past Wayne and

returns to his position

on the desk)
I'll have Mercy send some contracts
over. I'm sure we can find
something for you to do. However
minimal.

WAYNE
I look forward to it. I'll be at my
Metropolis offices.

He turns to see Gardner, looking PISSED.

SUPERMAN

Is there a problem officer?

GARDNER
(angry)
Yeah. I don't see a badge. You
can't just turn up and do our jobs
when you feel like it.

SUPERMAN

Just trying to help.

(Superman points across

the street at the

Getaway Car)
You might want to question that man
over there. I think he might have
something to do with the robbery.
69.

Gardner looks around see the Getaway Driver who's EYES BUG
OUT when he is discovered.

The Getaway car FLEES the SCENE.

INT. PENTHOUSE, LEXCORP PLAZA -- DAY

Luthor sits on his desk and DOWNS an energy drink.

He has been watching the Bank Robbery on his computer
monitors.

Mercy steps out of the Elevator.
MERCY

The contracts have been sent to
Wayne Enterprises.

LUTHOR
That should make the trust fund
baby happy.

MERCY

What about the break in at the
research center?

LUTHOR
(uninterested)
What about it?

MERCY
I think it deserves some attention.

Luthor shifts around on his desk to face his assistant.

LUTHOR
It's of no concern. We have what we
need and we're on schedule.

MERCY
There are security concerns at the
complex. Very serious concerns.
Somebody sold us out to the
Themyscirians.

LUTHOR
(matter of fact)
It was Morgan.
70.

MERCY
(shocked)
You knew.
LUTHOR

Morgan has a mercenary nature. He
saw an opportunity and exploited
it.

MERCY
And what's to be done.

He HOPS off his desk and walks over to the window and looks
out over his CITY.

LUTHOR
We exploit an opportunity. Contact
Cain.
She nods.
MERCY

There is the matter of the
conference. Have you reconsidered
attending?

LUTHOR
Why waste my time. I already know
how all of this will play out.

MERCY
I'll take care of the other matter.

She leaves.

display SEVERAL DIFFERENT ANGLES of a LARGE GATHERING of
people.

EXT. STREET, CENTENNIAL PARK -- CONTINUOUS

Lois, followed by Jimmy, walks towards an ENTRANCE to the
Park which is GUARDED by TWO MARINES.

Jimmy is FIDDLING with his CAMERA.
LOIS
(irritated)
Get your ass in gear Olsen!
JIMMY
Sorry I was just getting so many
good shots.
LOIS
I thought you wanted to see
Superman?

JIMMY
He's here already?

LOIS
He's about to be.

Lois walks toward the Entrance but is stopped by a MARINE.
Lois FLASHES her CREDENTIALS

MARINE#1
Centennial Park is off limits to
press.

LOIS

I'm Lois Lane. As a liaison with
Superman I have expressed
permission to be here by the U.S
government.

The Marine turns to his FELLOW SOLDIER who gets on the radio
to get confirmation on Lois' claims.

MARINE#2
She checks out let her through.

She moves past the Marines. Jimmy follows.
JIMMY

(awkwardly)
I'm with Superman too.

INT. SECTIONED OFF AREA, CENTENNIAL PARK -- CONTINUOUS

AREA of the Park. He cordially smiles as the ASSORTED WORLD
LEADERS present.

MAN(0.S)
(booming)
Bruce Wayne!

Bruce turns to se GENERAL CANDY, the HIGHEST RANKING U.S
ARMY FIGURE present. He stands with Swanwick, Silas and
Stewart.

WAYNE
General.

CANDY
You've met General Swanwick and
Professor Stone before right?.

SWANWICK
Mr. Wayne.

He and Wayne shake hands.

SILAS
Mr. Wayne Good to see you again.

WAYNE
Professor.

They shake hands.
Candy SLAPS Stewart on the shoulder.

CANDY
And this is John Stewart. The
toughest S.0.B to ever come out of
the Corps. Used to be my right hand
man before he went to work for the

eggheads.
STEWART
(to Wayne)
Sir.
CANDY

So what's your interest in Big Blue
Wayne?
73.

WAYNE
The same as everyone else. I want
to hear what he has to say.

CANDY
(dismissive)
Unless it's the oath of allegiance
I'm not interested.

WAYNE
I think there's more at stake here
than patriotism General. This is to
determine if the Superman is an
ally to the world not just American
interests.

CANDY
Look around you Wayne. Everybody
here wants to know who the Alien
calls boss. Let's just hope its
Uncle Sam.

STEWART
Well it's certainly not Mother
Russia.

CANDY
(laughs)
I have to give it to him, he knows
how to piss the commies off.

STEWART
Looking at the faces here it seems
he knows how to piss the whole
planet off.

WAYNE
(to Stewart)
And whats your take?

STEWART
Same as you. I'm going to wait and
see.
CANDY
(laughs)

John here has mellowed out some but
trust me if Big Blue starts any
more trouble this here's the last
guy he'd want to mess with.

WAYNE
Good to know.

CANDY
Mr. Wayne here isn't a fan of us
Military types. His company won't
build us any fancy gadgets.
74.

WAYNE
My company doesn't build weapons. I
don't see war as good business.

CANDY
Well lucky for us and our boys on
the front LexCorp does.

Amanda Waller walks past flanked by TWO ARMED BODYGUARDS.

WAYNE
Who's that?

SWANWICK
Amanda Waller.

CANDY
She used to be the Warden of Belle
Reve before she became Senator.
She's a mean piece of work. They
don't call her the 'wall' for
nothing.

The GATHERING STARTS to CONVERGE towards the ASSEMBLY AREA.

STEWART
Looks like this party's about to
start.

Wayne and the others follow the crowd as they flow towards
the Assembly Area.

INT. ASSEMBLY AREA, CENTENNIAL PARK -- CONTINUOUS

The WORLD LEADERS and the assorted MILITARY OFFICIALS have
taken their seats.

The SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE UNITED NATIONS take the Podium.

SECRETARY GENERAL
This is a solemn occasion. A year
ago today this city and our entire
Civilization experienced an event
unprecedented in our collective
histories. Our world changed. We
are now at a precipice. A turning
point that will determine the
future of our planet. And we'd
these words I give you

(gestures towards the

sky)
Kal El.

A HUSH goes over the CROWD. Superman FLOATS above them and
lands on the stage.

MARINES raise their WEAPONS and the TANKS train their
CANNONS on the Kryptonian.
75.

Superman takes the Podium and looks out over the Assembly.

Lois watches him with CONCERN. Jimmy SNAPS pictures.

SUPERMAN

(takes a breath)
My name is Kal El. I stand in front
of you today as a gesture of peace.
I know that my presence here has
changed how the human race
perceives itself. As a child I was
sent here from my world Krypton but
Earth has always been my home. It
is where I was raised. Everything I
know, everything I am comes from
here. I am one of you.

A DIPLOMAT yells from the audience.

President

A RUSSIAN

DIPLOMAT(O.S)
(shouts)
You are not one of us!

SUPERMAN
I understand your fears. But I am
not your enemy.

Nelson stands up.

PRESIDENT NELSON
And what are our assurances?

SUPERMAN
All I can give you is my word.

PRESIDENT NELSON
That just isn't enough. If we are
to trust you then we must know you.

SUPERMAN
I believe all the world needs to
know is that I am here to help. To
protect. I offer myself to humanity
freely and without condition.

DIPLOMAT stands.

RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT
(angry) . _
You attacked Russian Military.

SUPERMAN
They were firing on innocent
Civilians. Russian civilians.

RUSSIAN DIPLOMAT
(shouts)
Lies! That was an act of war.
76.
The conference ERUPTS.
The President holds up a FILE.

PRESIDENT NELSON
This file contains a list. In the
past year you have been involved in
several international incidents.
Russia, Great Britain, China. The
list goes on and on. You
consistently interfere with world
affairs with no regard to the
consequences or legal ramifications
of your actions.

SUPERMAN
I help where I can. I'm here to
save lives. I can't afford to stop
and consider what politicians will
be inconvenienced by my actions.

PRESIDENT NELSON
And as noble as your motives may or
may not be. You cannot expect us as
a species to simply sit back and
allow you to dictate the course of
our history without our consent.
Where is your authority?

SUPERMAN
Honestly I have none. I am not here
to be a dictator. I'm here to serve
the people of this planet in any
way I can.

PRESIDENT NELSON
And therein lies the problem. who
do you really serve? At the end of
the day Kal El you answer to no one
but yourself and that is a
frightening concept.

Stewart, who sits between Silas and Swanwick, leans toward
the Professor.

STEWART
I gotta give it to the lady. She
ain't scared of no one. Man or
alien.

Silas nods.
The President holds up a SECOND DOCUMENT.

PRESIDENT NELSON
I hold in my hand a United Nations
Bill. Signed and ratified by every
member state that demands you
(MORE )
77.

PRESIDENT NELSON (cont'd)
surrender yourself to it's
authority. If you are truly here to
serve then serve the people of
Earth by abiding by it's laws and
institutions.

SUPERMAN
That is something I cannot do.

PRESIDENT NELSON
Can't or won't.

SUPERMAN
I am here to serve all humanity
regardless of their allegiance.
What you are asking my to do is
take orders and eventually take
sides.

PRESIDENT NELSON
Then I do not see how we can allow
you to enforce your will on our way
of life, regardless of your
intentions. You're not leaving us
much in the way of options.

The BRITISH PRIME MINISTER stands.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER
You must agree to the U.N Bill.

The Conference ERUPTS with CHEERS of SUPPORT for the BILL.

SUPERMAN
But I will not be a prisoner or a
pawn for government interests and
that at the end of the day is what
the Bill means. It's submission to
an authority that I cannot
recognize because it prevents me
from serving all the people of the
world. I will pledge myself to
humanity but not to it's leaders.
I'm sorry Mrs President.

The Conference YELLS and MURMERS.
Wayne sits in silence pondering this turn of events.
Waller smiles to herself.

SWANWICK
This is all Waller needs.

STEWART
What do you mean?
78.

SWANWICK
Superman has just thumbed his nose
at every bureaucrat and politician
on the planet. The President will
sign off on Cadmus. This is exactly
what she wanted.

The Conference has gone CRITICAL.

Lois shakes her head in DISGUST at the REACTION of the
ASSEMBLY.

SUPERMAN
Please understand. I do this for
the good of the world. Not despite
it. I'm sorry.

He LIFTS off and takes to the sky. The sound of a SONIC BOOM
echos through the Park as he leaves.

WALLER
You will be.

INT. ACE O' CLUBS BAR, HOB'S BAY, METROPOLIS -- NIGHT

BIBBO BIBBOWSKI, an UNSHAVED BEAR OF A MAN, tends BAR in the
DINGY Hob's Bay BAR.

There are a FEW CUSTOMERS, MOSTLY DRUNKS.

Through the entrance walks Mercy, carrying with her a
BRIEFCASE. She walks past the bar towards a BOOTH ina
darkened CORNER of the room.

Sitting in the Booth is DAVID CANE, 50's, one of the World's
DEADLIEST ASSASSINS.

MERCY
I would have preferred if you had
picked a more discreet location.

CAIN
Plain sight has always been my
favorite form of discretion.
(gestures for her to sit
down)
Have a seat.

Mercy sits in the Booth opposite the Assassin. She puts the
Briefcase on the table.

MERCY
So I'm assuming you have agreed to
our proposal or why else would I be
here Mr. Cain.

CAIN
Once you've agreed to my price.
79.

MERCY
It's reasonable. It'll be half now
and half on completion.

She SLIDES the Briefcase over to him.

CAIN
And this is?

MERCY
One of the provisions of the
agreement.

Cain OPENS the Briefcase. He SMILES at the CONTENTS.
MERCY (CON'T)
Consider it a gift. Good faith
gesture but the Client insists you
use it. If you don't we'll know and
the agreement will be void.

CAIN
Fair enough.

Mercy nods and stands.
CAIN(CON'T)
It's very public. You sending a
message?

MERCY
In a manner of speaking.

She leaves.
INT. CLONING FACILITY, PROJECT CADMUS -- NIGHT

Federov sits at a Computer Terminal reading over endless
DATA and COMPUTER CODE.

LUTHOR(0.S)
Burning the midnight 011?

Federov jumps out his seat, STARTLED.

Luthor steps out from behind the Ultimate's Incubation
Chamber and SMILES.

FEDEROV
(worried)
Luthor! What are you doing here?

Luthor presses the control to open the Chamber and looks at
the sleeping Ultimate.

LUTHOR
Just checking up on my investment.
80.

FEDEROV
If anyone finds you in here...

LUTHOR
They'll forget they saw me or end
up being forgotten. There's
something I need from you.

FEDEROV
I can't. Not again.

Luthor gets close to the COWERING Scientist.

LUTHOR
You can and you will.
(gestures to the
Ultimate)
You've already done what I needed
you to do. What else can't you do?

FEDEROV
(pleading)
Please.

Luthor walks past Federov to the Computer Terminal and
casually attaches a FLASHDRIVE to the HARDDRIVE.

LUTHOR
There was an incident at the
research center. An attack. Some of
the material was taken.

FEDEROV
The subjects?

LUTHOR
It's insignificant. But I want to
make sure there are no setbacks on
this end.

Federov watches the code FLASHING across the Computer
screen.

FEDEROV
That's the Ultimate program data.
If Waller finds out.

LUTHOR
I don't see how she will.
(removes the flashdrive
and puts it in his
pocket)
And if she does I'll make sure
you'll be back in the shack in
Chechnya where I found you.

Federov lowers his head as Luthor passes and PATS him on the
back.
81.
LUTHOR(CON'T)
Keep up the good work. It's what
you live for.
As he walks he receives a CALL on his CELLPHONE.

Success?

INT. LIMO (MOVING) -- CONTINUOUS
Mercy sits in the back of the Limo on her Cell.

MERCY

LUTHOR(0.S)
Not at all. I'll see you at the
party.

She hangs up.

INT. DIANA'S LOFT, THEMYSCIRIAN EMBASSY -- NIGHT

Diana stands POISED. She HOLDS her SHIELD tight against her
chest and her SWORD pointed in front of her. Her eyes are
CLOSED.

Suddenly she EXPLODES into a SPECTACULAR COMBAT ROUTINE. She
SWINGS her Sword with expert GRACE and FLUIDITY.

She is FRIGHTENING and BEAUTIFUL to BEHOLD. Her speed is
SUPERNATURAL. SHe is a BLUR of FLESH and STEEL moving in
PERFECT SYNC.

She finishes and DROPS to one knee her Sword and Shield by
her side.

She OPENS her eyes.

In front of her arranged like an ALTER is her ARMOR
(CHESTPIECE which is MOLDED into an EAGLE, SILVER GAUNTLETS,
and a HELMET shaped like the SPARTAN WARRIORS VISOR with a
RED STAR emblazoned upon its BROW)

She RESTS her forehead on the HILT of her Sword and PRAYS to
her GODDESS.

Io enters.

CLARK
It's the suit. It's a little tight
around the neck.

LOIS
Give it here.

Lois adjusts his collar.

LOIS(CON'T)
Better?

CLARK
I like my other one better.

LOIS
Well you can't wear that here. Half
the people here are from countries
that want you arrested.

Clark smiles.

Martha appears behind them in a BEAUTIFUL DRESS and with a
GLASS of CHAMPAGNE.

MARTHA
(excited)
I just saw Bruce Springsteen. He's
got more grey hair than me.
(she pinches Clark's
cheeks)
Look at you in a suit.

CLARK
Are you drunk?
83.

MARTHA
(shakes the glass)
On this stuff. Not hardly. They got
any of the good stuff?

Louis points to the other side of the room.

LOIS
I saw a bar over that way. What do
you say we prop it up?

CLARK
Lois! (exasperated)
ois!

LOIS
Babe. I'm at a party thrown by a
man I loath. If you think I'm not
going to have a few shots you're
mistaken.

CLARK
(relents)
Fine. Just don't let Mom get
wasted.

MARTHA
(indignant )
Aw don't yourself.

Martha grabs Lois' arm and leads her towards the Bar.
MARTHA
(to Lois)
He brought his suit didn't he.
LOIS
It's in the car. He wanted to wear
it under his clothes.
Martha laughs OUT LOUD startling some guests.
PERRY(0.S)

Lois sees Perry and Jimmy among the Attendees.
LOIS
(to Martha)
I'll catch up.
Martha heads to the bar while Lois joins Perry and Jimmy.

PERRY
I didn't expect you to turn up.
84.

LOIS
Far be it from me to let old
grudges color my professionalism.

PERRY
(sarcasm)
I'll bet.
(firmly)
Don't make a scene.

LOIS
Honestly I'm here for the drinks.
If you'll excuse me.

Lois leaves to join Martha at the bar.

JIMMY
(to Perry)
You think she's telling the truth.

PERRY
Of course not.

Bruce Wayne walks through the room followed by Alfred. A
WAITER offers him some champagne. He declines.

ALFRED
Should I see if they have gingerale
Master Bruce.

WAYNE
Please.

Alfred leaves to get the gingerale.

Wayne continues to walk through the party until he spies a
Woman in a STUNNING RED DRESS standing looking out of the
window at the CITY LIGHTS.

He approaches her.

WAYNE
I can tell you didn't grow up ina
city.

Diana turns to face Wayne.

DIANA
Not like this. How could you tell?

WAYNE
City people are rarely so taken
with the lights.
(reaches out his hand)
Bruce Wayne.

Diana shakes his hand.
85.

DIANA
Diana.
WAYNE
A pleasure to meet you.
DIANA
Likewise Mr Wayne.
WAYNE
Please Bruce. I can't place your
accent.
DIANA
I come from Themyscira.
WAYNE
I've heard it's beautiful. I've
never been.
DIANA

My country doesn't interest men
like you. We are not Monaco. We
have no casinos.

WAYNE
(jokingly)
I could have some built for you.

DIANA
I'm sure.

WAYNE
What brings you to Metropolis?

DIANA
I am looking for someone.

WAYNE
Lucky someone. Perhaps I can help
you find them.

The Attendees of the party turn their attention to the Ball
Room's entrance.

Luthor has arrived dressed in a SLEEK BLACK SUIT with Mercy
on his arm.

He walks to the center of the room and the crowd GATHERS
around him.

DIANA
(polite)
I won't be needing your help, thank
you. Excuse me Mr. Wayne.

WAYNE
Bruce.
86.

She walks past Wayne towards the crowd. As she does Jimmy
SMILES at her.

JIMMY
(confident )
Hey there.

She IGNORES him and walks past him.

JIMMY (CON'T)
(rejected)
Bye there.

Martha, visibly TIPSY, appears and links arms with him.

MARTHA
I think you're punching a little
above your weight.

Jimmy nods as she leads him toward the crowd.
Luthor TAKES THE FLOOR.

He TAPS a SPOON against a WINE GLASS to get everyones
attention.

LUTHOR
Ladies and gentlemen let me thank
you for coming.

The crowd ERUPTS in APPLAUSE.
Clark pushes his way AWKWARDLY past people.

He STOPS when he sees Diana. She sees him too and both LOCK
EYES. Recognizing each others HIDDEN POWER.

LUTHOR(CON'T)

And I like to welcome you to the
Spire. She was started less than a
year ago today. I built it to honor
the city and the strength of its
people. She will stand as a beacon.
Shining even brighter than the star
that is my home, Metropolis. To
light the way for mankind. As a
tribute to our potential. An
example of the greatness we are
capable of achieving. A symbol we
can touch. That represents the
dream within us all. Of the heights
humanity can aspire to and the
depths of human sacrifice to be.
The people of this city raised the
Spire and it is they who I honor
here tonight. I believe in
humanity. I believe in us.

He raises his glass to THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.

Luthor, withMercy, moves through the crowd.

LOIS(0.S)
Very inspiring.

Luthor turns to see Lois and Martha by the bar.
Mercy steps in front of her Boss, DEFENSIVELY.

LUTHOR
(to Mercy)
It's fine.
(to Lois)
It's a nice surprise to see you
here.

LOIS
Wouldn't miss it. It was quite a
speech.

LUTHOR
Thank you Ms. Lane. You're not the
only one who's good with words.

LOIS
Except I don't write fiction.

LUTHOR
You write slander.

LOIS
Perry White maybe bound by some
misplaced Hob's Bay code of honor.
But I'm not. You may live far above
the law but all that means is you
have further to fall.

Luthor smiles at Lois' VEILED threat.
LUTHOR
The only thing I'm above Ms. Lane
is indulging in fantasy. Enjoy the
party.
Luthor leaves. Mercy GLOWERS at Lois before following him.

about her.

LOIS
And what's that supposed to mean?

CLARK
It's not like that she's different
from everybody.

90.
He Looks out of the window and uses his SUPER VISION to see
out of the window and across to the HIGHRISE. He sees Cain
with his RIFE AIMED.

CLARK
Take cover!

LOIS
What's happening?

Clark doesn't answer. He RUSHES out of the party BUMPING
into guests as he does.

Diana is STALKING Luthor through the party.

Luthor walks up to Edge who is FLIRTING with TWO MODELS and

LUTHOR
It is easier to forgive an enemy

Superman SHAKES off the effects of the sound and sets his
sights on Cain.

Cain takes a step back and pulls TWO HIGH POWERED HANDGUNS.

He FIRES at the Kryptonian but the bullets BOUNCE off his
chest.

Highrise EXPLODE in a BALL OF RED FLAME.

Huge chunks of DEBRIS fall from the sky down onto the street
and BYSTANDERS.

One such CHUNK falls DIRECTLY in the path of an oncoming
BUS. The DRIVER swerves as it SMASHES the windscreen and
CAREENS toward the evacuating guests.

WAYNE
(shouts)
Everybody move!
People RUN and JUMP out of the way of the Bus which CRASHES
through the entrance to the Spire DESTROYING the GLASS
EXTERIOR of the BUILDING before coming to a VIOLENT HALT.

Diana stands in front of the Bus HOLDING it in place with
her BARE HANDS.

The Driver looks at her in SHOCK.

Wayne looks around to see if anyone is injured and to his
SHOCK and HORROR he sees Alfred laying on the ground. The
Butler has a DEEP GASH in his FOREHEAD and his RIGHT ARM is
TWISTED and BROKEN.

Wayne RUSHES to his side.

Lois, Martha and Jimmy look up at the SMOKING REMAINS of the
Highrise and see Superman floating there holding in his
hands the CHARRED remains of Cain's black suit.

Wayne sees the Kryptonian and his eyes are filled with
ANGER.

INT. CLARK KENT'S STUDIO -- CONTINUOUS

The STUDIO is SMALL but COSY and filled with KEEPSAKES from

93.
She walks around and KNEELS in front of him.

LOIS
(comforting)
Tell me what happened.

CLARK

(guilty)
I failed.

LOIS
It's not your fault.

People were hurt because of me.
They're right. I am a threat.

WAYNE
Thanks for coming.

LESLIE
Will he be okay?

Thank you.

GRAYSON

What about you?
Wayne WALKS AWAY down the Hallway.

WAYNE
There's something I have to do.

INT. BASEMENT ARMORY, WAYNE ENTERPRISES METROPOLIS -- DAY

Bruce Wayne thinkers with a DEVICE on a workbench in the
SECRET ARMORY beneath the Wayne Enterprises Metropolis
Offices.

The Armory is a smaller Batcave. Large MONITORS hang. on the
walls along with various HIGH TECH GADGETS. Different
VEHICLES are covered in TARPS.

He raises the Device and it is revealed he is wearing a
REINFORCED METAL GAUNTLET. He FLEXES the FINGERS and they
WHINE electronically.

LUTHOR(0.S)
Impressive tech but it won't get
the job done by itself.

Bruce WHIPS around to see Luthor step out of the shadows,
SMILING.

WAYNE
(surprised)
How did you get past my security?

Luthor WAVES his Cellphone.

LUTHOR
(smiles)
I used my phone. I'd offer to
upgrade your system but I doubt
you'd get it. Old dogs, new tricks.

Wayne turns his back on Luthor and returns to fine tuning
his Gauntlet.

WAYNE
You can take your new tricks and
leave Luthor.

LUTHOR
You'll need some of my new tricks
if you plan to go up against it.
That is what your planning to do?

Luthor sees a METAL COWL on the workbench.

LUTHOR(CON'T)
Or is Batman going to do the
honors?

WAYNE
(unperturbed)
So you know who I am. You aren't
the first.
95.

LUTHOR
I don't care what you do with your
nights.

WAYNE
Then why are you here?

LUTHOR
I'm sorry about your Butler.

WAYNE
He's recovering.

LUTHOR
I'm glad to hear.
(beat )
You can't take it down by yourself.

WAYNE
We'll see.

LUTHOR
You spoke of an alliance Bruce. I'm
here to help.

WAYNE
There's nothing you have that I
need.

Luthor reaches into his jacket and removes a SMALL METAL
CYLINDER. Housed in the middle of the CYLINDER is a GLASS
VIAL containing a LUMINESCENT GREEN SUBSTANCE.

LUTHOR
I have this.

Wayne removes the Gauntlet and lays it down on the Workbench
and turns towards Luthor. He eyes the Cylinder SUSPICIOUSLY.

WAYNE
And that is?

LUTHOR

A new trick.

(he hands the Cylinder to

Wayne)
It's synthesized from a substance
we uncovered from the Indian Ocean
after they tried to terraform our
planet. We believe its radioactive
to them.

Wayne eyes the GREEN LIQUID.

WAYNE
I'm not an assassin.
96.

LUTHOR
It won't kill it. But it'll know
what it's like to bleed.

Wayne looks Luthor in the eyes.

WAYNE
(suspicious)
What's your stake in this Luthor?

Luthor SWIPES his finger ACROSS the SCREEN of his Cellphone.
THE MONITOR SCREENS on the Armory's walls FLICKERS to life.

Displayed on the Screens is a series of PHOTOS of A PRETTY
YOUNG REDHEAD at VARIOUS STAGES of her life... COLLEGE
GRADUATION... PARTYING WITH FRIENDS... KISSING HER
BOYFRIEND.

LUTHOR

Her name was Lena. She was a PR
executive for one of LexCorp's
smaller divisions. The building she
worked in was vaporized when the
Alien's attacked.

(beat )
They never found her body.

(swipes his fingers

across the phone and the

monitors goes black)
My sister was just one of thousands
Wayne. How many more?

Luthor turns to leave.
Wayne contemplates the Cylinder in his hand.

WAYNE
You know where to find him?

Luthor keeps walking.
LUTHOR

It, Wayne. It's never to far from

Lane.
Luthor leaves.
Wayne places the Cylinder on the workbench and picks up the
metal Cowl and carries it toward TWO HUGE DOORS which SLIDE
OPEN revealing a DARK ROOM.
He enters.

LexCorp nor Kord Industries could
be reached for comment.

Lois turns away from the Broadcast.

LOIS
(irritated)
Superman didn't kill anybody. He
was set up.

JIMMY
The whole world is saying he did.
And with injuries and property
damage they're going after him big
time.

LOIS
This has Luthor's stink all over
it. I'm going home. Take care
Olsen.

She leaves.
INT. LIVING ROOM, LOIS LANE'S APARTMENT -- LATER

Dammit.

She uses the LIGHT of her Cellphone screen and walks toward
the Kitchen and opens a drawer to find a light bulb.

BATMAN(0.S)
Where is he?

Lois almost JUMPS OUT OF HER SKIN and turns to see Batman's
SILHOUETTE against the living room window.

LOIS
Oh my god.

She runs for the door.

A Batarang STICKS into the wall in front of her and she
STOPS in her tracks.

When she turns around Batman is standing right in front of
her.

BATMAN
I'm not going to hurt you.

LOIS
What do you want from me?

EXT. 85TH AND SHUSTER -- NIGHT

Superman lands on the street between the ROWS and ROWS of
UNDER CONSTRUCTION BUILDINGS.
99.

BATMAN(0.S)
KAL!

Superman turns to see Batman down the street behind him.

Batman wears a SUIT of PROTECTIVE ARMOR. His GLOVES are
HYDRAULIC GAUNTLETS. His COWL is now a REINFORCED METAL
HELMET and his eyes are hidden behind SNOW WHITE LENSES. His
CAPE flows in the wind.

He steps forward, his HEAVY BOOTS THUDDING against the
street.

Superman LEVITATES off the ground and slowly DRIFTS toward
Batman.

He comes to a halt and the Man of Steel and The Dark Knight
STARE EACH OTHER DOWN.

SUPERMAN
(angry) ;
If you have something to say, say
it now...
(scans Batman with his
X-Ray vision)
Bruce Wayne.

BATMAN
(undaunted)
You're dangerous Kal.
SUPERMAN
They say the same about you.
BATMAN
All you are is power and no
control.
SUPERMAN

And all you are is a scared man in
a mask who threatens women.

SUPERMAN
(smiles slightly)
I don't threaten Kal. You have two
choices. Agree to the U.N proposal.

SUPERMAN
And be a prisoner?
BATMAN
It's better than the alternative.
SUPERMAN
Which is?
BATMAN

Your threat ends permanently
100.
Superman stares into the Batman's COLD WHITE EYES.

SUPERMAN
(firmly)
Go near Lois Lane again and I
promise you you'll regret it. We're
done here.

Superman turns to leave. Batman GRABS his shoulder.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
(angry)
Let go.

BATMAN
Can't you see? The lives that
you're putting in danger? The lives
you've already cost?

SUPERMAN
I said...
(eyes glow)
Let... GO!
He PUSHES Batman's CHEST PLATE and sends the Vigilante
reeling backwards and SLAMMING ROUGHLY into a PARKED CEMENT
TRUCK.

Superman looks back at Batman, REGRETFUL of what he's just
done.

BATMAN
(whispers)
You brought this on yourself.

He reaches behind his CAPE and produces a SILVER GRENADE.
He PULLS the PIN and THROWS it.
Superman CATCHES the grenade.
BOOM! -- It EXPLODES engulfing him in a THICK GREEN SMOKE.
Superman COUGHS and SPLUTTERS as the SMOKE FILLS HIS LUNGS.

The SMOKE CLEARS and Superman hears the sound of HYDRAULIC
JOINTS MOVING and then -- BAM!

Batman LANDS a CRUSHING RIGHT CROSS directly across
Superman's JAW. STAGGERING him.

Superman STUMBLES back trying to STEADY himself.

Batman follows up with a CRUSHING ONE TWO COMBO sending
Superman further back and then down to ONE KNEE. BLOOD
TRICKLES down his CHIN.

Batman stands above him.
101.
Through Superman's eyes: his vision is BLURRED.
SUPERMAN
(confused)
What have you done to me?
BATMAN
(smiles)
Evened the odds.

Superman GRITS his TEETH and LIFTS OFF. He SPEAR TACKLES
Batman.

He flies forward SMASHING his opponent BACKWARDS through the
WALL of an UNDER CONSTRUCTION building and SLAMS him to the
ground.

Batman GRIPS Superman by the THROAT and SQUEEZES trying to
CUT OFF the Man of Steel's AIR SUPPLY.

He DIGS his BOOTS into the CONCRETE floor and HEADBUTTS
Superman.

Superman PUNCHES Batman in the CHEST and sends him through a
WINDOW and out into the street.

Batman ROLLS OVER and as he does he PULLS another GRENADE
and THROWS it back through the window.

It EXPLODES bringing the ENTIRE BUILDING down onto Superman.
The Man of Steel throws the debris off.
Batman ATTACKS again.

He throws a PUNCH which Superman CATCHES in his fist and
retaliates with a COUNTER PUNCH which Batman CATCHES.

Both Men engage in a TEST of STRENGTH.
BATMAN(CON'T)
You're feeling it now. What it's
like to be human.
SUPERMAN
(struggling)
Why are you doing this?

BATMAN(CON'T)
Because no one else can.

Superman, even in his DIMINISHED state gains the UPPER HAND.

SUPERMAN
And if you beat me...

SPARKS fly from Batman's ARM JOINT as his Armor begins to
FALTER.
102.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
. who do they send after you?

Superman's EYES GLOW RED and he EMITS a BLAST of HEAT VISION
which IMPACTS Batman's Chest Plate causing it to melt.

Batman releases his GRIP and is sent HURTLING backwards into
another CONSTRUCTION SITE and DISAPPEARS from view.

Superman tries to SHAKE the FOG from his VISION. He wipes
the BLOOD from his CHIN.

With some EFFORT he TAKES OFF.

A HIGH TENSILE CORD wraps around Superman's ANKLE and he
STALLS in MID AIR.

Beneath him Batman, BLOOD DRIPPING from his own mouth, SMOKE
rising from his Armor has CONNECTED the other end of the
WIRE to a BULLDOZER which is being DRAGGED SLOWLY ACROSS the
ground.

The Dark Knight pulls a POWERFUL TASER from his BELT and
ELECTROCUTES the WIRE.

Superman YELLS out in PAIN as the WAVES of ELECTRICITY
COURSE through his body.

Batman TOSSES the Taser aside, and COILS the WIRE around his
FOREARM and pulls the WEAKENED Man of Steel back to Earth.

He SLAMS VIOLENTLY into the ground.

Before he can stand Batman is already upon him and WRAPS the
Wire around Superman's NECK and PULLS the Cord TIGHT.

BATMAN
(smiles)
There is no one.

Superman GASPS for AIR then JUDO THROWS Batman over his
shoulder SLAMMING him into the GROUND and STOMPING on his
CHEST and PINNING him.

He flies off taking Batman, whose arm is still WRAPPED in
the wire, with him.

EXT. SKY OVER RUINED METROPOLIS -- CONTINUOUS

Superman flies high above the RUINED sections of Metropolis
CARRYING Batman with him.

Batman SKIMS across the roof of whats left of a SKYSCRAPER.
He DIGS his FEET into the roof TEARING up CONCRETE as he's

DRAGGED towards the EDGE. He stops at the edge and WITH ALL
HIS STRENGTH pulls the Cord stopping Superman.
103.

His suits joints WHINE as he SWINGS Superman down onto the
roof.

Superman STANDS and moves out of the way just in time to
AVOID a KICK from Batman.

Superman PUNCHES Batman in the CHEST sending him SKIDDING
BACKWARDS toward the EDGE of the roof.

SUPERMAN
(weak)
That was two ribs.
(coughs)
Don't make me do this.

Batman SPITS blood and then WIPES his mouth before THROWING
a Batarang at Superman.

The Man of Steel catches the device which STARTS to BEEP
then EXPLODES.

Batman CHARGES and TACKLES Superman CLEAR OFF the roof.
Both Men SMASH through and the wall of an adjacent
DEMOLISHED BUILDING and CRASHES down through FLOOR after
FLOOR.

Batman FIRES a GRAPPLING HOOK which CATCHES as Superman
FALLS until he IMPACTS on the ground floor.

He lies there, his breathing LABOURED and looks up through
the HOLES in the FLOORS above him.

He STRUGGLES to his feet and STAGGERS out through the
CRUMBING LOBBY of what USED to be an OFFICE BUILDING.

He STUMBLES and FALLS to his knees and finds himself face to
face with a HUMAN SKULL.

He RECOILS in HORROR.
BATMAN(0.S)
(solemnly)
This is what happens when power
goes unchecked Kal.
Batman is standing behind him.
BATMAN(CON'T)
You're a nuclear bomb and this is
the fallout.
Superman takes a LABORED BREATH and raises his FISTS.
Batman attacks with a LIGHTNING FAST COMBINATION of PUNCHES
before terminating with a SIDE KICK which sends Superman
backwards through a CRUMBLING WALL.

Superman CRASHES out into the STREET.
104.
He gets to his feet. He's coughing HARDER now.

Batman walks slowly out of the Ruined Office Building. His
Armor's damaged joints SPARKING.

He throws a POWERFUL HAYMAKER but Superman is FASTER and
BLOCKS the ATTACK and FIGHTS BACK.

He lands a POWERFUL BLOW to Batman's GUT denting his Armor.
The Dark Knight SPITS out a GOB of BLOOD.

Superman attacks again but Batman BLOCKS, PARRIES and
COUNTERS.

Superman is still STRONGER and FASTER but Batman's EXPERT
FIGHTING ABILITIES nullifies Superman's attack.

He STRIKES the Man of Steel in the THROAT. Superman falls to
one knee.

BATMAN(CON'T)
I won't kill you...
(He strikes Superman in
the chest)
But I want you to remember Kal in
all the years to come...
(catches Superman across
the jaw)
In all your most private moments
(Kicks his knee and
elbows him under the
jaw)
That you're not a god...

Superman is BREATHING HEAVILY, TOTALLY SPENT.

BATMAN(CON'T)
That for all your power, for all
your strength...

He GRABS Superman by the THROAT and leans in CLOSE.

He RELEASES his grip on Superman's throat and DROPS him to
the ground.

BATMAN(CON'T)
I'm the one who beat you.

Superman lies, BEATEN.

BATMAN(CON'T)
All this...
(gestures to the ruins
around them)
Is because someone like you didn't
know control.
105.

Batman turns his back on the FALLEN KRYPTONIAN and walks
away.

BATMAN(CON'T)
I won't let it happen again.

He STOPS when he hears MOVEMENT and turns around.

Superman has GOTTEN BACK TO HIS FEET and is STANDING
DEFIANTLY.

With his FINAL OUNCES of STRENGTH he LAUNCHES at Batman
SPEAR TACKLING him back through a CHUNK OF WALL that is
JUTTING from the ground and into a BUILDING.

Superman holds Batman pressed AGAINST the wall and THROWS
WEAK PUNCHES into Batman's RIBS.

SUPERMAN
(yelling)
I tried to save them! I TRIED!

Batman HEADBUTTS Superman and sends him to the ground.

The Dark Knight is SEEING RED now and GRABS Superman by his
SYMBOL of HOPE. He begins to RAIN DOWN PUNCHES much the same
as he did with ZSASZ.

BATMAN
(in a frenzy)
YOU FAILED!

Superman is TOTALLY DONE now and can no longer even DEFEND
himself. He starts to go limp.

SUPERMAN
(whispers)
I'm... Sorry...
BATMAN
You f...
(whispers)
. failed.

Batman STOPS, his breath is in SHORT GASPS, and looks down
on the BEATEN and BLOODIED Superman.

SLUMPS against the wall. He sits down across from Superman.

Batman REMOVES his DENTED METAL COWL revealing his face
which is BRUISED and SWOLLEN.

Both Men are SILENT for a moment.
WAYNE
You held back. You could have
killed me couldn't you?

Superman doesn't answer just sits up against the wall across
from Wayne.

WAYNE(CON'T)
Why didn't you?

SUPERMAN
I figured I could reason with you
Bruce.

WAYNE

You weren't talking to Bruce Wayne.
(picks up his Cowl and
ponders it)

You can't reason with anger and

regret.

He TOSSES the Cowl ASIDE.

Superman looks around at the DESOLATE surroundings,
MOURNFULLY.

SUPERMAN
I didn't want this. I wanted to
save them. All of them. I thought I
could. I never knew I could fail so
badly.

Wayne is silent for a moment contemplating the BEATEN
Kryptonian in front of him.

WAYNE
You never do until it happens and
when it does it breaks you.
(beat )
His name was Jason Todd.

Superman looks into Wayne's PAIN FILLED EYES.

WAYNE(CON'T)
He was like you,
(beat )
...Dangerous. I thought I could
help him, train him, make him

107.

WAYNE(CON'T) (cont'd)
better. Instead I got him killed.
(voice cracks)
He was like my son. He was my son
and I failed him.

SUPERMAN
What do you do with it? With the
guilt.

WAYNE

I lost myself to it. I forgot who I
was. I didn't want to stop my
enemies anymore all I wanted to do
was hurt them.

SUPERMAN
All I want to do is save them.

Both Men sit in silence finally UNDERSTANDING one another..
Superman, still in PAIN, gets to his feet.

SUPERMAN
I'm not your enemy Bruce.

He reaches out his hand to Wayne.
Wayne TAKES Superman's hand and gets to his feet.
Superman and Batman stand HANDS TOGETHER.

Superman suddenly DOUBLES over in PAIN. Batman CATCHES him
before he falls.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
Silas Stone. Get me to Silas Stone.

INT. BEDROOM, SECOND FLOOR, SILAS STONE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Silas Stone WAKES and sees Batman standing above him. Before
he can SCREAM Batman COVERS his mouth with his hand.

BATMAN
(whispers)
Don't scream.
INT. LIVING ROOM, SILAS STONE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Batman leads Silas down the stairs and through his LIVING
ROOM towards the kitchen.

Inside he clicks on the light.
He GASPS when he sees a SICK and SEMI-CONSCIOUS Superman.
SILAS

(shocked)
Oh my God!
108.

BATMAN
He needs your help.

SILAS
What happened?

BATMAN
He's been poisoned.

Silas RUSHES to Superman's side and looks into his EYES
which have taken on an EERIE GREEN COLOR.

SILAS
Poisoned? Who did this?

BATMAN
(matter of fact)
I did.

SILAS
We need to get him to S.T.A.R Labs.
There's nothing I can do for him
here.

Suddenly Victor STORMS into the kitchen WIELDING a BASEBALL
BAT.

VICTOR
(shouts)
Dad! Get back!

He SWINGS WILDLY at Batman who GRACEFULLY DODGES the ATTACK.
Superman STIRS and Victor SWINGS at him. Superman simply
CATCHES the bat..

SILAS
(shouts)
Victor stop!
Batman GRIPS Victor's forearm TIGHT.

BATMAN
Listen to the man son.

Victor's eyes meet Batman's GAZE and he CALMS. Batman takes
the shattered bat from him.

SILAS
They're friends.

VICTOR
(shocked)
Batman?
Batman nods.

VICTOR
You're real?
109.
Silas tries to lift Superman. He STRUGGLES.

SILAS
Victor help get him to the car.

Victor helps Batman get Superman to his feet and help him
walk out of the house.

INT. HAMILTON ROOM. S.T.A.R LABS -- NIGHT

Superman is UNCONSCIOUS and lies on a TABLE while his body
is SCANNED by Silas who watches intently at the DATA on his
COMPUTER SCREEN.

Batman stands at his side, watching.

Victor leans against the wall. He feels totally OUT OF
PLACE.

BATMAN
How is he?

SILAS
He's lucky. I've managed to isolate
the compound in his blood stream.
He's severely weakened and he'll
need time to recover but he'll
live.

BATMAN
Good.

Silas turns around in his seat.

SILAS
You did this to him?

BATMAN
Yes. I thought he was a threat. I
was wrong.

SILAS
This compound is unlike anything
I've seen. The effect it has on
Kryptonian physiology. How did you
get come by it? You don't strike me
as a scientist.

BATMAN
It was given to me.

SILAS
By who?

BATMAN

A manipulative narcissist.

SILAS
Lex Luthor.
110.

BATMAN
(impressed)
You'd make a good detective.

SILAS
I've just seen the evidence and
although I can't prove anything Lex
Luthor has been the money behind
several projects that from what
I've seen all have one purpose.

BATMAN

To kill the Superman.
SILAS

What are you going to do?
BATMAN

Expose him.
SILAS

Easier said than done. Lex Luthor
buries all evidence. There's never
been anything to connect him to the
things he's done.

BATMAN
I'll dig. I'll find something. I
used to be a detective. Once upon a
time.
He turns to leave and walks past Victor.
BATMAN(CON'T)
(to Victor)
That's some swing. I think you
picked the wrong sport.
Victor smiles.
SILAS
What do you want me to tell him
when he wakes up?
Batman STOPS.

BATMAN
Tell him I'm sorry.

He leaves.
EXT. DIRT ROAD, METROPOLIS OUTSKIRTS -- MORNING

It's EARLY morning and the Sun is RISING above the
Metropolis skyline in the distance.

Bruce Wayne's Limo is parked on the side of a lonely DIRT
ROAD.
111.

A WHITE LIMO pulls up on the ADJACENT side. Mercy steps out
of the driver's side and walks around to the rear door and
opens it. Luthor steps out.

Wayne, still sporting BRUISES, steps out of his Limo and
both Men STARE EACH OTHER DOWN for a moment from across
their respective sides.

LUTHOR
You look better than I expected.

WAYNE
I don't appreciate being
manipulated.

LUTHOR
Then you shouldn't have made it so
easy. Who would have thought
tragedy would motivate you so. I
needed to test a weapon and the
opportunity presented itself. You
don't use a sword without knowing
its sharp.

WAYNE
I know you were behind Edge's
murder.

LUTHOR
(scratches his chin
dismissively)
So you know my dirty little secret
and I know yours. You know what

that is?
WAYNE
Stalemate.
LUTHOR
More accurately I win.
WAYNE
I'm not about to let you walk away
from this.
LUTHOR

There's nothing you can use against
me. You can't connect me to
anything. So don't waste your
breath on empty threats. But I know
everything about you Wayne.
Grayson, Gordon, what really
happened to Jason Todd.

At the mention of Jason Wayne CLENCHES his fists.

WAYNE
You can't threaten me Luthor.
112.

LUTHOR
I'm not threatening you Wayne. I'm
threatening every single person you
care about. And there's nothing you
can do about it.

Luthor nods to Mercy. Who opens the door for him.
LUTHOR(CON'T)
Go back to roughing up psychos in
Gotham.
(smiles)
And hope no more kids die in the
process.
Wayne's is ANGRY but keeps his COMPOSURE.
WAYNE
You tried to stab a god in the back
Luthor.
Luthor leans into the Limo.
WAYNE(CON'T)
(smiles)
And now he knows who's hand held
the knife.
Luthor pauses and looks over his shoulder slightly.

LUTHOR
We are done here.

Luthor sits into the Limo and Mercy closes the door.
Wayne watches as the Limo as it drives away.
INT. HAMILTON ROOM, S.T.A.R LABS -- NIGHT
Superman opens his eyes to see Victor sitting beside him.
SUPERMAN
(confused)
Where am I?
VICTOR
S.T.A.R Labs. My father and Batman
brought you here. You were sick.

SUPERMAN
How long was I out?

VICTOR
About 15 hours.

Superman sits up slowly.

SUPERMAN
And Silas?
113.

VICTOR
He'll be back.

Superman touches his SWOLLEN jaw.

SUPERMAN
I must look as bad as I feel.

VICTOR
Then you must feel pretty damn bad.
Did Batman do that to you?

Superman nods.

VICTOR(CON'T)
How? He's just a man?

Silas enters the room.

SUPERMAN
He cheated.

SILAS
How do you feel?

SUPERMAN
What did he do do me?

SILAS
You were poisoned by a radioactive
substance. Kryptonian in origin.

SUPERMAN
(surprised)
Kryptonian? How?

SILAS
Lex Luthor. He must have
synthesized from a by product from
the World Engine's terraforming.

Superman stands.
SUPERMAN
I have to go. People will be
worried.
He walks towards the exit past Silas.

SILAS
Matters are much worse.

Superman stops.
SILAS(CON'T)

(regretful)
I should have told you.
114.

SUPERMAN
Told me what?

SILAS
There is a Project called Cadmus.
They've found a way to replicate
Kryptonian DNA using your people's
technology.

SUPERMAN
(realization)
The Genesis Chamber.

SILAS
They've created a weapon with one
purpose. To kill you. And Lex
Luthor is behind it all. What
happened last night was only a test
of your weaknesses.
Superman CONTEMPLATES the information for a moment.

SUPERMAN
Thank you Silas. For everything.

Superman continues toward the exit.

VICTOR
He said he was sorry.

Superman stops by the exit and LEANS against it with one
hand to stay STEADY.

VICTOR(CON'T)
The Batman, he said he was sorry.

Superman responds to Victor's words with a nod and leaves.
INT. PENTHOUSE, LEXCORP TOWER -- NIGHT
Luthor exits the Elevator and walks over to his Bar where he
removes and Energy drink for the fridge and cracks it open.
He SMILES.
LUTHOR

I was wondering when you'd pay me a

visit.
He turns.

FLOATING outside the Window is Superman. ARMS FOLDED. He
STARES a HOLE THROUGH Luthor.

Luthor SWIPES his thumb across his Cellphone's screen and
the Window's SLIDE OPEN.

He walks out on the balcony to NEMESIS.
115.

SUPERMAN
Your assassin failed.

Luthor TILTS his head and observes Superman's WOUNDS.

LUTHOR
(smiles)
I wouldn't say failed.

SUPERMAN
This has to end now Luthor.

LUTHOR
It ends when you do. You brought a
war to my city and it's only right
I bring it right back to you.

SUPERMAN

You're a criminal and a murderer.
LUTHOR

So are you.
SUPERMAN

I'll expose you. I'll show the
world what you really are.

LUTHOR
All the while hiding what you
really are. You and Wayne are so
alike. So righteous and so
hypocritical. Both threatening to
reveal the truth about me but when
it.comes down to it he hides behind
a mask and you behind a symbol.
It's pathetic. And you think you
can come here and intimidate me?
You arrogant alien bastard.

Superman doesn't respond.

LUTHOR(CON'T)
And it's that arrogance that makes
you weak. You float there with all
your power but do you even know how
you do it? You were given these
gifts, you didn't do anything to
earn them and you use them like a
child would use a gun.

SUPERMAN
Bold words for a man who prefers
someone else's finger on the

trigger.

LUTHOR
Well we all can't shoot fire from
our eyes.

(MORE)
116.

LUTHOR (cont'd)
(takes a gulp from his
drink)
I think you should float away now.

Luthor turns his back on Superman.

SUPERMAN
You won't win.

LUTHOR

I already have. The problem with
you is that you are so assured that
nothing I can do can hurt you. Yet
you surround yourself with people I
can hurt.

(he turns to face

Superman)
Like Lois Lane.

Superman's face betrays his EMOTION. The THREAT has made him
ANGRY.

LUTHOR(CON'T)
Maybe I'll treat myself and buy the
Planet. Change things around a
little. By the time I'm done Lois
Lane will by licking my boot heels
just to cover a little league game.

Superman LUNGES and GRABS Luthor by the THROAT.

SUPERMAN

(angry) .
If you go near Lois Lane I'll...

LUTHOR
(strained)
You'll what kill me? Go ahead. Show
the world what you really are. Even
then I'll still win.

Superman eases his GRIP on Luthor's throat. He TOSSES him
back into the Penthouse

Superman regains his COMPOSURE.

SUPERMAN
(composed)
You say I hide behind a symbol.
What really makes you angry is that
you can't see what lies behind the
symbol. But I can see you for what
you really are.

Luthor HOLDS his throat and COUGHS.
117.

SUPERMAN (CON'T)
Behind the money and the suits,
behind LexCorp there is nothing but
a terrified little street thug.
Frightened of what he can't
understand.

LUTHOR

(angry)
I understand you perfectly.

SUPERMAN
I'm not talking about me. I'm
talking about a soul. In the end
I'm more human than you'll ever be.

Superman turns and FLIES away.
Lex is LIVID. He stands and RUNS out onto the balcony.

LUTHOR

(shouting, angry)
You've made your last mistake! This
City is mine! It's people are mine!
I'm going to show them all you're
nothing! I'm going to take
everything from you!

(whispers)
Even your soul.

She JUMPS out of bed and HUGS him.

LOIS

shocked)
Oh my god what happened?

SUPERMAN
It's okay. I'm fine.

LOIS
Your face?

SUPERMAN

Will heal. I just need to rest.

LOIS
And the Batman?

SUPERMAN
He'll be just as sore as I am in
the morning.

Nothing. I just don't feel like

Several BLACK CARS pull up outside the INCONSPICUOUS BARN.
Out of the Cars emerge SEVERAL GOVERNMENT and MILITARY

Candy.

CANDY

(to Swanwick)
Good to see you.
119.

SWANWICK
You too Sir.

CANDY

Stewart)
You must have pulled a few strings
to get those two here?

SWANWICK
Their my advisors.

CANDY
Works for me.
(Candy looks around)
Where's Waller?

WALLER(0.S)

Waller stands by the BARN DOORS.

WALLER(CON'T)
Glad you could make it General
Candy. If you would be so good as
to follow me.

CANDY
(to others)

They all follow Waller into the Barn. Where they find that

INT. AUDITORIUM, PROJECT CADMUS -- LATER

The OFFICIALS follow Waller into a AUDITORIUM where FEDEROV
waits.

They stand behind a LARGE THICK GLASS WINDOW which separates

REINFORCED STEEL DOORS.

Silas reaches out his hand to Federov.
SILAS
Dr. Federov. I've read your work.
It's quite an honor to finally meet
you.

Federov AWKWARDLY shakes Silas' hand.
120.

FEDEROV
Thank you.

WALLER
You'll have to excuse Dr. Federov
what he lacks in social skills he
makes up for in genius.

SILAS
(to Waller)
I'm sure. I'm very interested in
seeing the results of your project
Waller.

CANDY
As am I.

WALLER
I promise you General. What you see
here today will make Superman look
like a one of your grunts.
(to Stewart)
No offense.

STEWART
None taken.

Federov nods to Waller.

WALLER
If you'll take your seats we shall
begin.

The Officials take their seats as Federov OPERATES his
Tablet.

The Steel Doors OPEN and a LARGE STEEL CAPSULE is WHEELED
into the room by TwO TECHNICIANS.

FEDEROV
Allow me to present the Ultimate.

Federov ACTIVATES the Capsule. It OPENS to reveal THE
ULTIMATE.

The Creature's BODY is CONCEALED in a GREEN CONTAINMENT SUIT
with TWO RED EYES.

CANDY
What is it?

FEDEROV
It's a being of my design. Cloned
from cells derived from an alien
specimen.
121.

SILAS
Kryptonian DNA is complex. How did
you bridge the gaps between

sequences.
FEDEROV
We used DNA from compatible
specimens.
SILAS
Human?
FEDEROV

In a manner of speaking.
Silas is intrigued by Federov's answer.

CANDY
What's with the suit?

FEDEROV
Kryptonian abilities is dependent
upon absorption of solar energy.
We've enhanced that.

CANDY
Which means?

FEDEROV
We've made it stronger. The suit
regulates how much the Ultimate
absorbs.

CANDY
Stronger's good.

WALLER
(to Federov)
I'm sure General Candy would
appreciate a demonstration.

Federov nods.

He operates the Controls and the Ultimate STEPS out of the
Capsule.

It STOMPS over to the Concrete wall.

STEWART
You're controlling it?

FEDEROV
The Ultimate has been pre
programmed to follow our commands.

WALLER
Totally obedient. Completely under
our control.

out on the front lines?

There are still a few more tests
but I'm confident once President
Nelson gives the go ahead we can
have the Ultimate in the field
within the year.

Project.
