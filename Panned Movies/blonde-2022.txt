A LITTLE STRIPED TIGER:
A stuffed child’s toy.
1 INT. GLADYS’ 1929 FORD (MOVING). DAY. 1
She is cradled by Norma Jeane, 7 years old today, golden- *
haired, with a rosebud mouth, who sits very still, just the
way Mother likes her to.
Mother casts a sidelong glance at the child, seductive, for
this is Gladys’ way, she draws you in.
GLADYS
Mother has a surprise for you.
Waiting up ahead.
NORMA JEANE
A s-surprise?
GLADYS
A birthday surprise.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, mother! Where are we going?
GLADYS
Where are we going? Listen to you.
2 INT. BUNGALOW APARTMENT - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. DAY. 2
Close on Norma Jeane with Mother’s hand over her eyes...
GLADYS
Go on. Through here. Go on.
...as Mother guides her into the bedroom.
GLADYS
Can’t you see? Open your eyes and
see?
Norma Jeane looks; where is the surprise? Hidden? Under the
bed? In the closet?
GLADYS
Norma Jeane, I swear you’re half-
blind sometimes. Look. That man is
your father.2.
Norma Jeane looks to where Gladys is pointing. It is not a
man: It is a picture of a man; hanging on the wall beside the
bureau mirror.
NORMA JEANE
Father?
Norma Jeane’s heart, so fluttery, like a humming bird’s
wings.
NORMA JEANE
He- he’s my f-father?
GLADYS
Shh! Look. Your father.
Reverent silence as they contemplate the man-in-the-picture-
frame, the man-in-the-photograph, the man-with-a-pencil-thin-
moustache-and-dark-soulful-eyes.
GLADYS
His name is a beautiful name and
it’s an important name but it’s a
name I can’t utter.
Gladys removes the photo from the wall and cradles it at
Norma Jeane’s eye-level.
GLADYS
Here. But, no - mustn’t touch with
sticky fingers.
Norma Jeane looks at the photo, from which a splintery light
seems to be reflected.
GLADYS
No one knows. And no one must know.
Even that you’ve seen this. There
are complications in both our
lives, you see. When you were born,
your father was away. He’s at a
great distance even now, and I
worry for his safety. In our hearts
we are wed - we are husband and
wife. Though we scorn convention
and will not acquiesce to it.
NORMA JEANE
But where is he?
A lone fly is buzzing, striking itself repeatedly against the
window pane. Gladys’ eyes glaze, and seem to turn inward.3.
GLADYS
(mysteriously)
There’s the damn fly ‘buzzed when I
died.’
Gladys gets up and rehangs the photo on the wall. Steps back.
Out of her trance.
GLADYS
So, your father. But it’s our
secret, Norma Jeane. Enough for you
to know that he’s away - for now.
But he’ll return one day soon. He’s
promised.
3 INT. KITCHEN - BUNGALOW APARTMENT - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. DAY. 3
And now a surprise! An angel-food birthday cake for Norma
Jeane!
GLADYS
Happy birthday, Norma Jeane. Didn’t
I tell you, Norma Jeane, this is
your special day?
The telephone begins to ring. But Gladys, smiling to herself
doesn’t answer. With hands shaking, she lights the seven
candles of the cake.
GLADYS
Oh, my are hands shaking! Or is the
room is vibrating? In California
you never know what is ‘real’ or
what is ‘just yourself’.
Norma Jeane looks to the phone, and looks back to Gladys with
anxiety. Why doesn’t Mother answer the phone?
GLADYS
So, Norma Jeane! Now you know.
You’ve looked upon his face. Your
true father, who isn’t named Baker.
But you must never tell anyone,
d’you hear?
NORMA JEANE
Y-yes, mother.
Between Gladys’ brows a sharp crease appears.
GLADYS
Norma Jeane, What?4.
NORMA JEANE
Yes, Mother.
GLADYS
That’s more like it.
(beat)
And now you must make a wish, Norma
Jeane. A wish for you-know-who to
return to us soon. Come on.
Norma Jeane shuts her eyes and blows out all the candles save
one in a single breath.
4 INT. BEDROOM - BUNGALOW APARTMENT - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. DAY. 4
So much excitement, now she’s exhausted. Her head lolls on
her shoulders as Mother walks her into the bedroom and lays
her down on the sagging bed. Gladys tugs off her shoes and
opens the top drawer of the bureau, to remove a towel to
place beneath Norma Jeane’s head.
GLADYS
Here, so you won’t drool on my
pillow.
Gladys straightens, looks down into the empty drawer.
CUT TO
A STRANGE LOW ANGLE; LOOKING UP AT GLADYS, FROM WITHIN.
GLADYS
D’you remember, Norma Jeane, who
used to sleep in here? In this
drawer? Don’t you remember?
Norma Jeane shakes her sleepy head no.
GLADYS
You! You, Norma Jeane! You used to
sleep in this very drawer! We were
so poor that this drawer was your
crib. But it was good enough for
us, wasn’t it?
Gladys shoves the drawer shut and we slide sickishly into
darkness. Sealed up. Mute.
5 OMITTED 5 *5.
6 MONTAGE: EXT. FIRESTORM. NIGHT. 6
A single spark, the first spark, the first ever spark out of
nowhere. An enormous tree, a hundred years old, bursts into
flame. More sparks, like malicious seeds, borne by the
wind...
Walls of flame, twenty feet high, leap across coastal
highways like rapacious living creatures. Birds burst into
flame in midair.
Fireballs roll down the Hollywood Hills like the wrath of
Jehova. Stampeding cattle shriek in terror and run ablaze
like torches! Buildings implode in the flames like bombs!
Fields of fire! Canyons of fire!
7 INT. BEDROOM - BUNGALOW APARTMENT - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. NIGHT.7
Mother shaking her awake.
GLADYS
Norma Jeane, wake up! Hurry.
8 EXT. BUNGALOW APARTMENTS - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. NIGHT. 8
Gladys pulls her, in her pajamas and bare feet, out of the
bungalow and toward the car.
GLADYS
Hurry, hurry, hurry. We have to be
quick.
Through the wind-born ash and dust. So many sirens! Men’s
shouts! Strange high pitched cries that might be the shrieks
of birds or animals. Norma Jeane sees the lurid firelight
reflected upon the clouds in the sky.
9 INT. GLADYS’ 1929 FORD (MOVING). NIGHT. 9
Why is mother driving the car in the wrong direction? Not
away from the fire-splotched hills but toward them.
Other cars head in the opposite direction; downhill, their
headlights blinding. Norma Jeane squints at her mother with
pale anxiety.
GLADYS
(shrill & fast)
Don’t look at me like that!
(MORE)6.
GLADYS (cont'd)
Don’t squint as if I’m going to
crash this car in the next instant,
you’ll make yourself need glasses
and that’s the end for you! Stop
squirming like a little snake
needing to pee.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, Mother, what if the house burns
down? I forgot my Tiger.
GLADYS
That Toy! You’d be fortunate if it
did burn. It’s a morbid attachment.
10 INT. GLADYS’ 1929 FORD (PULLING TO A STOP ON LAUREL CANYON 10
DR). NIGHT.
Ahead is a fire barricade. Flares on the road. The blinding
lights of emergency vehicles. Gladys is forced to brake by
uniformed officers.
SHERIFF’S DEPUTY
Where the hell do you think you’re
going?
GLADYS
Home. I live at the top of Laurel
Canyon and I have right to drive
home don’t I?
SHERIFF’S DEPUTY
Where exactly? What’s the address?
GLADYS
That’s my business.
He comes closer, shining the flashlight into her very face.
Suspicious, skeptical.
SHERIFF’S DEPUTY
Who’s that in the car with you?
GLADYS
(laughs)
Well, it’s not Shirley Temple.
Norma Jeane sees, uneasily, that the Sheriff’s Deputy is
fascinated by her mother, the way he’d be fascinated by
someone leaning too far out of a high window or bringing her
hair too close to a flame.7.
GLADYS
(calmly)
We’ve been invited to a private
residence at the very top of Laurel
Canyon. The owner has a fireproof
mansion. My daughter and I will be
safe there. I can’t say this man’s
name, officer, but it’s a name you
all know. A titan in the film
industry. This little girl is his
daughter. This is a city of sand
and nothing will long endure but
we’re going.
SHERIFF’S DEPUTY
(sighs)
Go home ma’am, and put your little
girl to bed. It’s late.
GLADYS
Actually officer, I want to see
hell close up. A preview.
Gladys has spoken in her sexy-husky voice, and the abrupt
change is disconcerting.
SHERIFF’S DEPUTY
Ma’am, you need to turn this car
around. Now, I can give you an
escort if you need one, but this is
an order and if you don’t turn
around right now you’ll be placed
under arrest.
GLADYS
Arrested! For driving my car!
(beat)
Officer, I’m sorry. Please don’t
arrest me.
(lowers her voice)
I wish you could shoot me.
SHERIFF’S DEPUTY
Lady, go home. You’re drunk or
doped up and nobody’s got time for
it tonight. You’re saying things to
get you into trouble.
Gladys clutches at his arm. The smeary cold cream face, the
dilated eyes, the smell of alcohol on her breath.
GLADYS
You Man! Thinking your dirty man
thoughts!8.
11 INT. GLADYS’ 1929 FORD (MOVING). NIGHT. 11
Hot winds buffet the car, snaky spirals of dust fly past.
Massed clouds turbulent with flamey light.
NORMA JEANE
Mother? Was he here? Father? All
this time? Why didn’t he come to
see us?
GLADYS
You! Shut up!
Gladys’ hand leaps from the steering wheel, dealing Norma
Jeane a sharp backhand blow.
GLADYS
Pig! Beast!
Norma Jeane whimpers and hunches in a corner of the seat,
drawing her knees up to her chest.
12 EXT./INT. GLADYS’ 1929 FORD. (MOVING) NIGHT. 12
A detour sign. Another detour. Gladys indignant, sobbing,
desperate. A crying sniveling child beside her. She is thirty
four years old. No man will ever look at her again with
longing. Driving out into an intersection, rivulets of sweat
on her face, looking from left to right to left.
GLADYS
Oh, God, which way is home?
‘MARILYN’ (V.O.)
Because she loved the child and
wished to spare her grief...
13 INT. BUNGALOW APARTMENT (BURNING) - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. NIGHT1.3
Norma Jeane, naked and sobbing, crawling through the flames
to hide behind the spinet piano. No live sound, this sequence
is as mute as a tomb:
‘MARILYN’ (V.O.)
Because the fires in the hills were
a clear summons and a sign.
Mother striking the piano keyboard with both fists, an outcry
of sharp treble notes.9.
‘MARILYN’ (V.O.)
Because the child was her own
secret self exposed.
Norma Jeane defying mother, eluding mother. Scrambling across
the carpet like a panicked animal.
‘MARILYN’ (V.O.)
Because the very father of the
child had wished it not to be born.
14 INT. BATHROOM - BUNGALOW APARTMENT - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. NIGH1T4.
Scalding hot water rushing into the tub.
‘MARILYN’ (V.O.)
Because he had given her money,
scattering bills across the bed.
She raises the child, trying to lift her, and force her into
the water. The child resists, screaming.
‘MARILYN’ (V.O.)
Because he told her he’d never
loved her; she had misunderstood.
Norma Jeane, plunged under the water.
‘MARILYN’ (V.O.)
Because before the pregnancy he had
loved her, and after he had not.
Norma Jeane, drowning...
‘MARILYN’ (V.O.)
Because he would have married her.
She was certain.
...Fighting free, running from the steamy bathroom, and out
of Mother’s clutching arms.
15 INT. BUNGALOW APARTMENT (BURNING) - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. 15
CONTINUOUS.
Norma Jeane running through the burning apartment.
‘MARILYN’ (V.O.)
Because no one could love a child
so accursed.
Sound returns with these words flung after her, like stones:10.
GLADYS
Because of you! You! You’re the
reason he went away. He didn’t want
you!
16 INT. BUNGALOW APARTMENTS - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. NIGHT. 16
Norma Jeane, naked, runs blindly through the corridor, pounds
at a neighbor’s door:
NORMA JEANE
Help! Help us!
She runs farther along the corridor and pounds at a second
door:
NORMA JEANE
Help! Help us!
As she runs toward the third door, it opens, and a young man,
in an undershirt and beltless trousers, blinks down at her in
astonishment. This frantic little girl, totally naked, her
face streaked with tears.
NORMA JEANE
Help us, my mother is sick! Come
help my mother, she’s sick!
He snatches up his shirt from the chair and wraps it quickly
around the child, covering her nakedness. A woman appears
from the back bedroom.
MISS FLYNN
(recognizing her)
Norma Jeane? Your mother’s sick?
What’s wrong with your mother?
Miss Flynn looks down the corridor and sees tendrils of smoke
unfurling under Gladys’ door.
MISS FLYNN
(alarmed)
Clive, bring her in, come in here,
Norma Jeane. You wait here with me.
17 INT. MISS FLYNN’S BUNGALOW APARTMENT - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. 17
NIGHT.
The child takes the proffered hand and folds gratefully into
the Miss Flynn’s embrace.
FADE OUT.11.
Beat. Then:
MISS FLYNN (PRE-LAP)
Your momma is well enough to see
you now, Norma Jeane...
18 INT. MISS FLYNN’S BUNGALOW APARTMENT - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. DA1Y8.
Miss Flynn is smiling brightly. ‘Uncle Clive’ is behind her
in the doorway. Like pallbearers they are.
MISS FLYNN
Your Momma has been asking for you,
Norma Jeane! The doctors say she’s
well enough to see you. Shall we
go?
‘Shall we go?’ This is movie talk; the child is alerted to
danger.
NORMA JEANE
W-where is she?
MISS FLYNN
She’s in the hospital in Norwalk.
NORMA JEANE
S-she’s better now?
MISS FLYNN
She’s well enough for you to visit
with her.
Miss Flynn smiling, her mouth too full of teeth.
MISS FLYNN
Uncle Clive is going to take us in
the car. I’m going to put a few
things in a suitcase for you. You
don’t have to do anything. Why
don’t you go out into the yard and
play.
19 EXT. YARD - BUNGALOW APARTMENTS - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. DAY. 19
Norma Jeane comforts her Little Stuffed Tiger. She sings to
it listlessly.
ANGLE ON: The Little Tiger; firescorched, most of its hair
burnt away, and its glassy eyes fixed in an expression of
idiot horror.12.
20 INT. BEDROOM - MISS FLYNN’S BUNGALOW APARTMENT - 828 HIGHLA2N0D
AVE. DAY.
She’s dressed in her good school clothes: A plaid pleated
skirt, a white cotton blouse, Miss Flynn brushes at her curly-
snarly hair.
MISS FLYNN
(sighs)
No use!
She lets the hairbrush fall.
MISS FLYNN
I’d be tearing half the hair out of
your head, Norma Jeane, if I
persisted.
21 INT. MISS FLYNN’S BUNGALOW APARTMENT - 828 HIGHLAND AVE. DA2Y1.
By the front door, with the suitcases, Miss Flynn notices the
Stuffed Tiger.
MISS FLYNN
Why don’t you leave that Norma
Jeane?
But Norma Jeane hugs her Tiger tight.
NORMA JEANE
This is my Tiger. My mother gave to
me.
22 INT. ‘UNCLE CLIVE’S’ CAR. (MOVING) DAY. 22
Clutching desperately at her Tiger, Norma Jeane regards the
backs of the heads of the adults.
All ride in grim silence. Play out.
CUT TO:
23 NORMA JEANE’S POV OF... 23
...A brick building bearing a sign, above its front entrance,
that makes no sense:
LOS ANGELES ORPHANS HOME SOCIETY
EST. 192113.
This is not a hospital. Where is the hospital? Where is
Mother? The child begins to tremble uncontrollably. Uncle
Clive gets out of the car an goes to retrieve the suitcases
from the trunk. Miss Flynn turns to Norma Jeane in the back
seat. The child in the grip of animal panic.
MISS FLYNN
Please forgive me, Norma Jeane,
there’s no other place for you
right now - your mother is sick,
the doctors say she is very sick -
she tried to hurt you, she can’t be
a mother to you just now - I can’t
be a mother to you just now...
24 EXT. LOS ANGELES ORPHAN’S HOME. SOON AFTER. 24
She has to pry the terrified child out of the backseat.
MISS FLYNN
Oh, Norma Jeane! That hurts.
Half carrying, half dragging, alternately begging and
scolding:
MISS FLYNN
Norma Jeane, please. Be a good girl
please, Norma Jeane. Don’t kick me
Norma Jeane!
Turning his back on the struggle, ‘Uncle Clive’ strides away
to light a smoke in the open air. He’s a bit player who’s had
mostly walk on roles - he has no idea how to manage an actual
scene.
MISS FLYNN
At least bring the suitcases,
Clive, damn you!
CLOSE ON: Norma Jeane, weeping, stuttering:
NORMA JEANE
But I’m not an orphan! I have a
mother! I have a father! My father
lives in a big mansion in Beverly
Hills! I’m not an orphan!
25 INT. LOS ANGELES ORPHAN’S HOME. SOON AFTER. 25
Now we’re in the dank, airless corridor, Norma Jeane is being
pulled along by a stranger’s hand, heaving raw with tears and
snot, there is no sync sound, she’s sealed up mute, entombed.14.

NORMA JEANE (V/O)
To be the object of male desire is
to know you exist. Though your *

wanted. Though your father didn’t
want you, you’re wanted. When a man
wants you, you’re safe.
Hands slip between her legs and Norma Jeane’s eyes close.

Norma Jeane enters an office of gleaming teakwood and glass.
Taxidermy birds peer down at her. Mr Z., behind the desk,
lifts his eyes, suspicious and assessing.
Every baby needs a Da-da-daddy

And then he’s pushing her toward the white fur rug, shoving
her sharkskin skirt up to her waist and tearing at her
panties.
Some sweet softy , who enjoys
Bringing home his baby little diamond toys, oh ho!
His penis is being nudged into her, sharp as a screwdriver.
Norma Jeane’s hair is white, as if with terrible shock, and
her eyes as unseeing as stones. And she repeats, under her
breath, like a mantra:

A light flashes on his desk, his Assistant calls out:
ASSISTANT (O.S.)
I. E. Shinn, on line one.
The DIRECTOR, hung-over, with Huston-esque features, sighs,
and picks up the phone:
DIRECTOR
This is about a girl, right?
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE)
No. It’s about an actress. A very
special talent who would be ideal
for the role of ‘Nell’.
DIRECTOR
(groans)
They’re all special when we’re
fucking them.
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE)
This girl is truly remarkable. She
could be a major star if she’s
given the right role.20.
DIRECTOR
She’ll be a gorgeous hick with
bouncy breasts and a sulky lower
lip. Another bottle blonde and
she’s going to be a star.
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE)
She will be. I’m giving you the
chance to discover her.
DIRECTOR
(sighs)
Ok, Issac. Send her over. Check
with my assistant for the time.
43 INT. DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - FOX LOT. DAY. 43
Her blue eyes are brimming with panic, both her hands
trembling, holding the script. And her voice so breathy you
almost can’t hear her speaking, like a school-girl nerved up,
to declare:
NORMA JEANE
I’ve read the script, the whole
script, it’s a strange disturbing
story, like a novel by Dostoyevski
where you feel sympathy for
criminal and don’t wish to see her
punished.
The Director laughs.
DIRECTOR
Oh, you’ve read Dost-ie-ev-sky,
have you, honey?
She blushes, knowing she’s being mocked. I. E. Shinn stands
there glowering, red-faced, spittle gleaming on his thick
lips.
DIRECTOR
All right, Miss Monroe, lets begin.
She holds the script in her trembling hands, the words blur
on the page.
NORMA JEANE (V.O.)
If you fail you must die. If you
fail. When you fail. You will fail.
(N.B. Norma Jeane’s V.O. has the quality of chatter,
background noise, the workings of an unquiet mind.)21.
DIRECTOR
...Miss Monroe?
She looks up from her script, in the grip of despair, and
pleads in a choked voice:
NORMA JEANE AS ‘NELL’
But you haven’t any reason to l-
leave now.
ASSISTANT AS ‘JED POWERS’
(flat)
Sure I have. I want to.
NORMA JEANE AS ‘NELL’
(frantic)
But she’ll be quiet.
ASSISTANT AS ‘JED POWERS’
It’s not her. I’ve got an
appointment.
NORMA JEANE AS ‘NELL’
I’ll go with you. Let’s go dancing.
ASSISTANT AS ‘JED POWERS’
What’s the matter with you? You’re
supposed to be here with that kid.
NORMA JEANE AS ‘NELL’
Stay. She wont b-bother you
anymore.
ASSISTANT AS ‘JED POWERS’
You bother me. I can’t figure you
out.
NORMA JEANE AS ‘NELL’
I’ll be anyway you want me to be.
ASSISTANT AS ‘JED POWERS’
Why? Why’s it so important?

I’m Jed, Nell. Jed.22.
NORMA JEANE AS ‘NELL’
(interrupts)
...I didn’t think you were ever
coming back. They told me you were
lost at sea.
ASSISTANT AS ‘JED POWERS’
I’m not the man you think I am.
Remember him Nell? Remember? Now
think back. What did he look like?
She closes her eyes and imagines:

He had brown eyes and shiny black
hair.
BACK TO:

I’m not Phillip, I’m Jed, Nell.
Jed.
NORMA JEANE AS ‘NELL’
Peoples names...? You’re not him?
You never were.
She stammers and falters and...
DIRECTOR
Thank you, Miss Monroe.
The men in the room are visibly disturbed by the intensity of
her performance. Norma Jeane looks up from her script.
NORMA JEANE
P-please, can I try again?
An awkward pause.
NORMA JEANE
I think I could be ‘Nell’. I k-know
- I am ‘Nell’. She’s a sleepwalker.
She doesn’t see him; ‘Jed Powers’
She sees her dead fiance; She’s
trapped in delusion. But where does
dreaming end and madness begin?
(MORE)23.
NORMA JEANE (cont'd)
Anyway, isn’t all ‘love’ based on
delusion?
The Director is astonished, doesn’t know what to say; looking
at this beautiful ‘Marilyn’ and her Agent with his tragic
gargoyle face.
ASSISTANT (PRE-LAP)
What’d you think, boss?
45 INT. DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - FOX LOT. LATER. 45
ASSISTANT
That was pretty bad, wasn’t it?
Like watching a mental patient,
maybe. Not acting. No technique.
The Director stands by the window, smoking.
WRITER
(likes the sound of his
own voice)
People like that, you can see why
they’re drawn to acting. Because
the actor, in her role, always
knows who she is. All losses are
restored.
ASSISTANT
What d’you think, boss?
The Director watches as, a floor below, I. E. Shinn and the
blonde walk away from the building. The Director exhales
smoke, coughs in pain:
DIRECTOR
Sweet Jesus. Will you look at the
ass on that little girl.
46 EXT. NORWALK STATE HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING. DAY. 46
That same ass approaching the main gate.
NORMA JEANE (PRE-LAP)
Are you sure a visit with her wont
be too upsetting?
47 INT. DR. BENDER’S OFFICE - NORWALK STATE HOSPITAL. DAY. 47
Dr. Bender, resident psychiatrist, with an oyster-round face:24.
DR. BENDER
Upsetting to your mother or to you,
Miss Baker.
NORMA JEANE
I haven’t seen my mother in ten
years.
48 INT. VISITOR’S LOUNGE - NORWALK STATE HOSPITAL. DAY. 48
Yet she recognizes her at once; a thin faded woman in a faded
green shift, crookedly buttoned.
NORMA JEANE
M-mother? Oh, mother! It’s Norma
Jeane.
She awkwardly embraces Gladys, who neither embraces her in
return, nor resists her. Norma Jeane bursts into tears,
surprising herself with the rawness of her emotion. They are
in a visitors lounge among strangers. Norma Jeane’s trembling
badly and can’t seem to catch her breath. She looks around
and sees the ward nurses whispering; comparing them.
49 EXT. GROUNDS - NORWALK STATE HOSPITAL. DAY. 49
Slowly and painstakingly they walk, Gladys’ swollen feet
shuffling in the worn felt slippers. Norma Jeane has the urge
to break free from her mother and run, run!
NORMA JEANE
Mother! It’s so nice here.
Gladys detaches herself from Norma Jeane and shuffles to the
nearest bench, where she sits immediately, like a collapsing
umbrella. Folding her arms as if she were cold, or spiteful.
Norma Jeane draws a dove-grey shawl over her mother’s
shoulders.
NORMA JEANE
Are you warmer now, Mother? Oh,
this shawl is so pretty on you!
She can’t seem to control her voice, tasting panic, as if
she’s found herself in movie scene without being given words
to speak, and so she must improvise:
She squeezes her mother’s hand.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, Mother, it’s been so l-long.
I’m sorry.25.
She rummages in her handbag and brings out an envelope
containing recent magazine features and photos of herself.
Exclusively ‘nice’ poses, nothing cheap or vulgar. Gladys
stares at the photos and her thin lips get thinner.
NORMA JEANE
It’s been so exciting this past
year, so w-wonderful, like a
fairytale, sometimes I can’t
believe it - I’m a model. I’m under
contract at the Studio - where you
used to work. I can make a living
just being photographed. It’s the
easiest work in the world!
(Is she listening to
herself? What the hell is
she saying? )
You can keep all these, if you want
to. They’re c-copies.
In each of the photos Norma Jeane looks different - Girlish -
Glamorous - Girl-next-door - Sophisticated - Ethereal - Sexy -
Gladys frowns at the photos, as if examining a puzzle.
NORMA JEANE
(uneasily)
I guess there isn’t any Norma
Jeane, is there?
She pauses, waits for Gladys speak. To say something.
NORMA JEANE
M-mother?
Gladys turns toward her, frowns severely.
NORMA JEANE
My f-father was under contract to
the studio? You said? Around 1925?
I’ve been sneaking around there
trying to find his picture in the
files, but -
Now there’s a reaction; fury:
GLADYS
Where’s my daughter! They said my
daughter was coming. I don’t know
you. Who are you?
Norma Jeane’s stricken face. She doesn’t know what to say.
Beat.26.
Gladys shifts uneasily in her chair. It is then that Norma
Jeane notices the hands: Her mothers hands; restlessly
stroking each other, wrestling each other for dominance.
ELISHA COOK JNR (PRE-LAP)

practically cured.

The hands! The restless, seeking hands! Hands of Madness,
unwrapping a razorblade! Norma Jeane as ‘Marilyn’ as ‘Nell’
with Gladys Mortensen’s hands and mesmerized stare, lifting
the razor. Gladys’ soul in young Norma Jeane’s body, bringing
the razor to her throat!
‘JED POWERS’ (O.S.)
Nell? Don’t do that! You don’t want
to do that!
‘Jed Powers’ pushes through the crowd gathered in the
Hallway...
‘JED POWERS’
Nell!
CLOSE ON: ‘Nell’ pressing the razor against her throat. Oh,
so happy!
DIRECTOR (O.S.)
And...Cut!
Norma Jeane; a wild look in her eye, hearing Mother’s voice! *
Seeing Mother reflected in the mirror! *

She’s on the phone, in her apartment, listening to her agent *
reading the ecstatic reviews: *
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE) *
-in this darkly disturbing thriller *
also starring Richard Widmark. Her *
portrayal of a mentally unbalanced *
young baby-sitter is so chillingly *
convincing - *
NORMA JEANE *
Oh Mr Shinn! At the premiere I shut *
my eyes a lot. I couldn’t believe *
that girl was me. But everyone in *
the audience would think it was me: *
‘Nell’. And afterward at the party: *
‘Marilyn.’ *
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE) *
Are you on painkillers? Is it your *
period? *
NORMA JEANE *
No, it’s not. That’s no business of *
yours! I’m not on painkillers, I’m *
not. *
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE) *
Sweetheart, the next film is going *
to be terrific, I promise you. A *

NORMA JEANE *
Oh, she’s pretty I guess. But it *

people find out? *
EDDY G. *
(self-absorbed) *
I hate this one, I look like an *
asshole, with my mouth open, like *
I’m panting. *
NORMA JEANE *
(burrowing into Cass) *
Oh! I wish I could just hide in *
your arms! Forever and ever in your *
arms! *
CASS *
(laughs) *
You don’t mean that Norma, an *
actress wants to be seen. An *
actress wants to be loved by a *
multitude of people. *
NORMA JEANE *
It’s as if it’s all happening to *
someone right next to me. *
Eddy shows them Hollywood Confidential, with the threesome on *
the cover: Dancing together in a bar on the strip. *
EDDY G. *

‘Young men-about-town Charlie *
Chaplin Jnr and Edward G. Robinson *

CASS *
(mock offense) *
Vulgar. *
EDDY G. *
Exploitative. *
CASS *
‘Marilyn’ is a serious actress. A *
sexpot? What’s a sexpot? *29.
Grabbing at her buttocks. Her vagina. *
CASS *
Is this the sexpot? Or this? *
Norma Jeane squeals, giggles, she leaps to her feet and they *
chase her through the apartment. She’s cornered on the bed, *
just the touch of them making her melt. Dreamy-sticky kisses, *
the rapture beginning... *
54 INT. NORMA JEANE’S APARTMENT. LATER. 54 *
They’re fucking her now. Or Eddy G is, while Cass smokes and *
tenderly strokes her face. She’s lost in rapture that goes on *

NORMA JEANE *
Yes. *

Oh, Norma. I guess I do love you. *

I’m jealous of you and Cass. I’m *
jealous of anybody who looks at *
you. If I could love any woman, it *
would be you. *
ON CASS; *
Those lovelorn woeful eyes: *
CASS *
Norma? When you say you love me, *
when you look at me, even - who do *
you see, truly? The Little Tramp? *
Do you see him? *
NORMA JEANE *
No. Oh, no! I see only you. *30.
CASS *
People think being Charlie *
Chaplin’s son is a blessing. Like *
it’s a fairytale and I’m the King’s *
son. But we’re cursed, Eddy and me. *
EDDY G. *
We’re Juniors. Of men who never *
wanted us. *
EDDY G. *
But at least you two have fathers. *
At least you know who you are! *
CASS *
Oh, we knew who we were before we *
were born. *
NORMA JEANE *
And how do you know they never *
wanted you? You can’t trust your *
mothers to tell you the absolute *
truth. When love goes wrong, and a *
couple gets (divorced) - *
EDDY G. *
‘Love’? Are you serious? Fucking *
bullshit ‘love’ little fishie is *
telling us. *
NORMA JEANE *
I don’t like that name - ‘fish’. I *
resent that. *
CASS *
And we resent you telling us what *
we should be feeling. You never *
knew your father, so you’re free. *
You can invent yourself. I love *
your name: ‘Marilyn Monroe’: so *
totally phony. I love it! Like you *
gave birth to yourself. *
EDDY G. *
Of course, my old man is *
practically shit next to yours. Two- *
bit gangster flicks. Anybody can *
imitate him sneering. But Charlie *
Chaplin- *31.
CASS *
(interrupts) *
I’ve asked you not to talk about my *
father, Goddamn you. You know shit, *
about him and me. *
EDDY G. *
Oh, fuck yourself, Cassie, what’s *
the big deal? Did he ever break *
your ribs? Mine did. My mother *
testified to it in divorce court. *
CASS *
At least she could testify in *
divorce court. My mother was too *
drunk. *
EDDY G. *
Your mother! What about my mother? *
CASS *
Look, we’ve all got sick mothers. *
I’ll spare you mine, if you spare *
me yours. Deal? *
Eddy giggles. *
EDDY G. *
I’ll drink to that. *
The champagne bottle he’s reaching for falls to the ground *
and breaks. *
EDDY G. *
Jesus! Not Again. *
And suddenly all three are laughing again. *

She reaches for a tissue. *
NORMA JEANE *
Oh I knew. I guess I knew. I’ve *

happy. *
The Doctor, mishearing, seeing only this young woman’s tears, *
reaches for her ringless hand. *
DOCTOR *
My dear. You’re healthy. It will be *
all right. *

I’m happy I said! I want this baby. *

Hey, Norma, what’s it? You look-- *
...Sliding into the booth, grinning in dread, *
CASS *
--Fraught. *
She bursts into tears. She takes their hands in hers and *
kisses them, each in turn. The men are frightened of her, *
exchanging glances between themselves. *
CASS *
Oh, Norma. You think you are? *
EDDY G. *
This what I think it is? Ohhhh, *
man. *
Both grin, panic clutching at their hearts. Norma Jeane fixes *
her beautiful anxious eyes on theirs. *
NORMA JEANE *
Are you h-happy for me? Us - I *
mean? *
What can they say but: *
CASS & EDDY G. *
Yes. *33.
59 EXT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT. NIGHT. 59 *
Drunk on red wine, giddy, excited and tearful, on their way *

NORMA JEANE *
It’s like the movies! The kind of *
thing that only happens in the *
movies. *
EDDY G. *
What? *
NORMA JEANE *
That little Tiger. I had one like *
him once. A long time ago when I *
was a girl. *
And there it is, abandoned on the sidewalk: The Little *
Striped Tiger. *
EDDY G. *
(picking it up) *
Baby’s first plaything. Cute! *
NORMA JEANE *
But who does it belong to? That *
belongs to somebody. *

CASS *
This is a vision for Baby to see. *
Just wait. *
And now begins the succession of brightly illuminated *
billboards, passing overhead: Movies! Movie star faces! *
EDDY G. *
Norma! You can look or not, but-- *
And most spectacular of all; approaching on the towering *
billboard; thirty feet across; *34.
her voluptuous body, her beautiful taunting face, her red- *
glistening lips parted so suggestively... *

No. Nothing is wrong. I just can’t. *

Not now? Why not now? *
NORMA JEANE *
My private life. *
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE) *

NORMA JEANE *
My private life. I have my own *

I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE) *
Marilyn, you’re the newest box *

you. He wants it as a showcase for *
you. *
NORMA JEANE *
(sighs) *
How much would I get? *
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE) *
Your contract salary. Fifteen *
hundred a week. *
NORMA JEANE *
And how much would Jane Russell *
get? *
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE) *
(evasive) *
The deal is pending. Russell has to *
be lent by another studio. *
NORMA JEANE *
Yes, but how much? *
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE) *
The figures arent finalized. *
NORMA JEANE *
How much? *
I. E. SHINN (ON PHONE) *
They’re asking one hundred *
thousand. *
NORMA JEANE *
One hundred thousand! *
63 IN HER WOMB 63 *
Baby feels a stab of hurt! Baby, too, is insulted. *
NORMA JEANE *
I’ll get about eighteen thousand *
dollars and Jane Russell gets a *
hundred thousand? That’s an insult! *
I’m going to hang up now. Goodbye. *

65 INT/EXT. 1951 LIME-GREEN CADILLAC COVERTABLE (MOVING). DAY.65 *
There is now a long deep scrape on the fender. Serrated dents *
in the grill. Norma Jeane sits between her lovers in the *
crowded front seat. Cass seems irritable, working his mouth *
as if trying to swallow, an alarming not-thereness in his *
eyes. *
NORMA JEANE *
You know who rang my Agent again? *
That ex-ballplayer. What nerve! You *
see the billboard, you make a call *
and an offer. What’s Marilyn’s *
price? *
CASS *
You can play hard to get. Hard to *
get into. Great role for ‘Marilyn’. *
EDDY G. *
(to Cass) *
He’s famous. He must be rich. *
CASS *
(to Eddy) *
Marilyn’s famous. She’s not rich. *
NORMA JEANE *
Oh, but I’m not famous like him. He *
had a long career before he *
retired. Everyone loves him. *37.
CASS *
So why not you? *
She glances anxiously at Cass; not the reaction she was *
hoping for. *

I can see that, and I’m totally *

Oh! - it’s beautiful. Like in a *

The pool is cleaned every Monday *
morning. I’m sure it was cleaned *
this week. *
Eddy G clambers up onto the diving board and flexes his knees *
as if about to dive in. *

Don’t dare him, please. Don’t even *
look at him. I don’t intend to *
drown trying to rescue him. *
EDDY G. *
Fuck you, Jew-boy. *
68 INT. ‘THE CYPRESSES’. DAY 68 *
Moving through the house now, Norma Jeane whispers to Eddy G: *38.
NORMA JEANE *
Eddy, this is crazy. I can’t afford *
this. *
EDDY G. *
We’ll swing it somehow. We three. *
The sunken living room has parquet floors, furniture shrouded *
in white, a gigantic stone fireplace. Mirrors reflect other *
mirrors in an infinite regress that makes Norma Jeane’s heart *
flutter. *
REALTOR *
It’s a fantasy house, isn’t it *
dear? So original and inventive. *
The three of you are going into *
seclusion? This is the ideal place *
I promise you. *
The Realtor leads them into the... *
69 NURSERY... 69 *
NORMA JEANE *
What a b-beautiful room. *
Though it isn’t - just large. The walls decorated with Mother *
Goose Creatures and American Cartoon creatures: Mickey Mouse, *
Donald Duck. Flat blank eyes. *
On the incessant wind, Norma Jeane hears voices, children’s *
muffled laughter. *
REALTOR *
The alarm system is complicated and *
was expensive to install. The *
previous owner had an extreme fear *
of someone breaking into the house *
and murdering her. *
EDDY G. *
Just like my mother. That’s the *
first symptom. But it’s not the *
last. *
Cass stands there, working his mouth as if there is something *
he can’t swallow. Surely he hears it too: a faint mewling, *
whimpering, someone crying: Help! Help Me. *
Norma Jeane tries to slip an arm around him. *
NORMA JEANE *
Cass, I want to go home. *39.
CASS *
(shrugging her away) *
Lay off. *
REALTOR *
Norma Jeane is something wrong? I *
thought, I’d take you through... *
The Realtor opens another bedroom, behind a brocaded drape *
something is moving agitatedly. *
NORMA JEANE *
(scared) *
Oh-look! *
REALTOR *
It’s nothing - I’m sure. *
She moves to investigate, but Cass restrains her. *
CASS *
No. Fuck it; just shut the door. *
Norma Jeane and Eddy G. Exchange a worried glance. *
A sudden slithering sound, a scuttling-scurrying movement. A *
shadow in flight. *
REALTOR *
(screams) *
Rattlesnake! *
Panicked, Eddy G leaps up onto a table, pulls Norma Jeane up *
with him. Cass turns dead white. His face sweating, his *
pupils dilated. *
CASS *
It’s my fault. I’m to blame. I *
shouldn’t have brought us here. *
EDDY G. *
I don’t see the fucker. Anybody *
actually see the fucker? *
CASS *
They’re everywhere. In bathrooms, *
in toilets, I can’t stop them. It’s *
because of me they’re here. *
He drifts into a kind of fugue state, like a man in shock. *
NORMA JEANE *
Cass? Cass? *40.
No response. *
EDDY G. *
Let’s get him home. *
70 INT/EXT. 1951 LIME-GREEN CADILLAC COVERTABLE (MOVING). DAY 70 *

Did you know about this, Eddy? *
These ‘things’ of his? *
EDDY G. *
(Evasive) *
I wasn’t sure whose they were, *
y’know? His or mine. *
Cass in the back seat, shivering and whimpering, in a trance. *
NORMA JEANE *
Oh, God. We should take him to a *
doctor. It’s the D.T.’s isn’t it? *
We should take him to the emergency *
room. *
Eddy G shakes his head. Norma Jeane pleads: *
NORMA JEANE *
We can’t just pretend like there’s *
nothing wrong with him. *
EDDY G. *
Why not? *
Off Norma Jeane’s reaction. MUSIC IN. *
71 A DREAM IMAGE: 71 *

Driving to Norwalk, she passes a movie house where a gigantic
‘MARILYN MONROE’ is stretched across the marquee. ‘MARILYN

echo of her dream.

NORMA JEANE
Everyone was so worried about you,
Mother. You won’t ever run away

GLADYS
I knew where I was going.
NORMA JEANE
You could have been injured. Hit by

Tenderly, Norma Jeane washes her mother’s feet and applies
iodine to the cuts. Gladys yawns. She looks about to drift
off to sleep.
NORMA JEANE
Anytime you want, Mother, you can
come home with me. You know that.
You’re not old. You shouldn’t call
yourself old. You’re only fifty
three.
(slyly)
How’d you like to be a grandmother?
Gladys opens her eyes wide.
GLADYS
What year is this? What time did we
travel to?43.
NORMA JEANE
Mother, it’s May 1953. This is
Norma Jeane, here to take care of
you.
GLADYS
But your hair is so white.
Gladys shuts her eyes again.
NORMA JEANE
When you h-had me, Mother, you
weren’t married, I guess? You
didn’t have a man supporting you.
Yet you had a baby. That was so
brave, Mother! Another girl would
have - well, you know. Gotten rid
of it. Of me.
(Startled squeaky laugh)
Then I wouldn’t be here, at all.
There wouldn’t be any Marilyn. And
she’s getting so famous now, fan
letters! telegrams! flowers from
strangers! It’s so strange...
Gladys is drifting off. Her face softening like melting wax.
Norma Jeane’s eyes turn inward.
NORMA JEANE
But you were brave. You did the
right thing. You had your baby. You
had ...me.
Gladys bloodless lips hang slack. Norma Jean looks scared.
DR. BENDER (PRE-LAP)
Her’s is a mystery illness, an
illness no one truly understands. A
syndrome of symptoms.
78 INT. DR. BENDER’S OFFICE - NORWALK HOSPITAL. DAY. 78
NORMA JEANE
Is it inherited?
DR. BENDER
Excuse me?
NORMA JEANE
My mother’s illness? Are you born
with it in your blood?44.
On DR. BENDER, evasive. Pre-lap the sound of a phone
ringing...
79 INT. HALLWAY - NORWALK HOSPITAL. DAY. 79
She’s in the Hallway on the payphone. Listening to it ring
and ring and ring...
80 INSERT: ‘BABY’ IN THE WOMB: 80
The far away sound of a phone ringing...
...and then the ‘click’ of someone picking up at the other
end.
NORMA JEANE (O.S.)
(frantic whisper)
Help me, please! I need help so
badly.
81 INT. MR Z.’S OFFICE - 20TH CENTURY FOX. DAY. 81
Mr Z. with the phone to his ear, listens in silence. He’s
heard these words many times before.
MR Z.
What I’ll do, Marilyn, is turn you
over to Yvet. You know Yvet. She’ll
help you.
82 INT. RECEPTION AREA - 20TH CENTURY FOX. DAY. 82
Yvet is Z.’s Secretary/Assistant, the woman from that morning
in his office.
YVET
Marilyn? I’ll make the
arrangements...
83 INT. HALLWAY - NORWALK HOSPITAL. DAY. 83
Norma Jeane listening.
YVET (ON PHONE)
...Plan for tomorrow morning, eight
A.M. I’ll pick you up at home.45.
84 INT. NORMA JEANE’S APARTMENT. DAY. 84
She untangles herself from Cass and Eddy G. and crawls out of *
her sweaty bed. *
She downs down one, two, three! codeine tablets. *
She exits with a guilty backward glance toward the Little *
Striped Tiger. *
85 EXT. NORMA JEANE’S APARTMENT. DAY. 85
The light outside is blinding! How can you see anything?
Is that a sleek black Studio car she’s walking towards? A
chauffeur in uniform and visored cap?
86 THE STUDIO CAR - MOVING... 86
...Swiftly through the streets? Is this a (dream?)
NORMA JEANE
Please. I want to go back.
She raps at the glass.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, hey! - I changed my mind, see?
My mind is my own, to change. It
is.
A woman (Yvet?) grabs at her with gloved net hands.
87 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR? 87
A woman’s face, hard to see in the light. Are they in a
corridor? Is Norma Jeane tied down?
YVET
This is Doctors official day off.
Doctor will be playing golf later
this morning at the Wilshire
Country Club with his friend Bing
Crosby.
NORMA JEANE
Please won’t you listen? Please
I’ve changed my mind.46.
88 INT. OPERATING THEATRE? 88
Now there are BRIGHT LIGHTS! It’s very confusing! And FIGURES
above her.
NORMA JEANE
Please listen! Please, this isn’t
me!
As she’s lifted onto the table:
YVET
You’re in good hands, dear. Mr Z
has promised. A million-dollar
investment cannot be risked. You’ll
never be at risk if The Studio can
prevent it.
A Doctor with pokey fingers, poking inside her. Everything at
a distance: Like hearing screams in another room.
DOCTOR
Don’t struggle please. There’ll be
no pain.
NORMA JEANE
Please don’t! Won’t you listen?
Rubber hands with a syringe...
DOCTOR
This will put you in a twilight
sleep. We don’t wish to restrain
you.
...An injection.
NORMA JEANE
Wait. No. There’s been some
mistake. I-
She shoves the hands away. Rubber hands! Overhead, the light
is blinding! Has she travelled (possibly?) into the future
and the sun has expanded to fill the entire sky?
NORMA JEANE
No! this isn’t me!
Oh, but she’s slipping from the table, thank god!
89 ALONG A CORRIDOR... 89
...Running barefoot, panting. It’s not too late!47.
Up a flight of stairs...
...there’s smoke, the door unlocked, so she pushes it open:
A familiar place...
90 THE APARTMENT ON 848 HIGHLAND AVENUE! 90
...though full of smoke! In the next room a muffled sound.
Yes...
91 ...GLADYS’ BEDROOM. 91
The bureau. The drawer she must open.
Tug, tug, tug, at last it opens!
And there is BABY, flailing his tiny hands and feet, gasping
for air.
Thank god! She’s saved him!
Knock-knock-Knocking...
VOICE (O.S.)
Miss Monroe? Please. It’s time.
Knocking at her...
92 DRESSING ROOM DOOR. (SOUND STAGE) 92
They’ve been calling her for how long?
Forty minutes she’s been sitting there, in perfect hair,
perfect cosmetic mask, in a staring trance, in her gorgeous
hot-pink silk gown, gloves to her elbows, glittery costume
jewelry around her lovely neck. Listening to the playback out
on the soundstage:
LORELEI-LEE (O.S.)
Bye, bye, Baby
Remember you’re my baby
When they give you the eye...
I’ll be lonely
But even though I’m lonely
There’ll be no other guy...48.
LORELEI-LEE *
I’m one of the winners of the *
American lottery, I know it, I’m *
grateful, and I never take it for *
granted... *
93 INT. VILLAR’S STEAKHOUSE. BEVERLY HILLS. NIGHT. 93 *
She’s on a date with the darkly taciturn Ex-Athlete. *
THE EX-ATHLETE (CONT’D) *
...Baseball was my life. Baseball *
was my ticket up and out. And now, *
well, I’m retired. I still have *
plenty to do, public appearances, *
endorsements, advisory boards... *
A blush darkens his horsey-handsome face. *
THE EX-ATHLETE (CONT’D) *
...I guess I sound like a sap. *
NORMA JEANE *
Oh, no! It must be awfully strange *
to be a-- well, a hero. Anyway, you *
don’t seem retired. You’re in the *
papers so much. *
THE EX-ATHLETE *
Not half as much as you, Marilyn. *
NORMA JEANE *
(wincing) *
Who? - me? That’s just studio *
publicity. *
(distressed) *
Oh, they’re awful, the things they *
make up. *
(beat) *
I know you’re supposed to get used *
to it, but I just can’t. It really *
hurts. *
He ponders this, but is uncertain of how to respond. He *
tries: *
THE EX-ATHLETE *
How did you get your start? *
NORMA JEANE *
(puzzled) *
What start? *49.
THE EX-ATHLETE *
In movies. Acting. *
She tries to smile. Strange and unnerved, she becomes in this *
moment an actress without a script. She stammers: *
NORMA JEANE *
I don’t know. I guess - I guess I *
was discovered. *
THE EX-ATHLETE *
Discovered how? *
A more sensitive companion wouldn’t pursue this line of *
questioning. She tears up. Looks lost inside herself. Looks *
around the room, it seems full of leering faces: *
NORMA JEANE *
M-maybe we should leave? I’m afraid *
of some of the people here. *
Impulsively, the Ex-Athlete reaches across the table and *
takes her hand in his. *
THE EX-ATHLETE *
I know what it’s like to be lonely. *
She looks at him tearfully. *
NORMA JEANE *
I just want to begin again from *
zero. I want to live in another *
world, a simpler world. *
He nods. *
THE EX-ATHLETE *
I know what you mean... *
NORMA JEANE (CONT’D) *
(interrupts) *
I want to live in - Oh, Chekhov! *
I want to move to New York and *
study acting. Serious acting. In *
the movies, they cut you together *
from hundreds of disjointed scenes. *
It’s a jigsaw puzzle but you’re not *
the one to put the pieces together. *
His smile is sagging under the weight of her ambitions. Like *
a student in an improve scene, Norma Jeane understands that *
she is mismanaging her cue and failing her audience. She *
switches tack. *50.
NORMA JEANE (CONT’D) *
Oh, but mostly I want to settle *
down, like any girl. And have a *
family. Oh, I love children so! I’m *
crazy about babies. *
Did she just hear herself? The expression on her face; like a
trapdoor opening.
NORMA JEANE (PRE-LAP)
Did somebody die?
94 INT. HER DRESSING ROOM - FOX LOT. DAY. 94
NORMA JEANE (CONT’D)
What is all this?
Floral displays crammed in her dressing room. Piles of
letters and telegrams.
NORMA JEANE
(comic routine)
These flowers! Am I a corpse, this
a funeral home? A corpse needs a
makeup man! Whitey!
Her assistants (DEE-DEE, TRACEY) laugh.
NORMA JEANE
White-eey?
She throws up her arms in stage distress.
NORMA JEANE
I’m a slave to this Marilyn Monroe.
I signed up for a luxury cruise,
but like Lorelei Lee, I’m in
fucking steerage paddling.
They laugh.
WHITEY,
(reproachful)
Now, Miss Monroe. You don’t mean a
word of what you say. If you
weren’t ‘Marilyn’, who’d you be?
DEE-DEE
(wiping her eyes)
Miss Monroe! You’re cruel. Any one
of us, anybody in the whole world,
would give their right arm to be
you. And you know it.51.
NORMA JEANE
(Crestfallen, she
stammers)
Oh! - I d-do?
95 TIME JUMP: 95
They have stitched her into her gown for the ‘Gentlemen
Prefer Blondes’ Premiere. WHITEY is working his magic with
powder, pencils and paints.
Norma Jeane pops a Nembutal, while reading the letters:
NORMA JEANE *
(sighs)
Like Movie critics. Some of them
love ‘Marilyn’, and some of them
hate ‘Marilyn’. What’s that got to
do with me?
Dee-Dee hands over a fan letter with an odd stricken
expression.
DEE-DEE
Miss Monroe? This is a confidential
letter, I guess.
Norma Jean unfolds it and reads the neat handwriting:
NORMA JEANE
Dear Norma Jean,
This is possibly the hardest letter
I have ever penned.
A elderly man’s voice takes over:
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
Truly I do not know why I am contacting
you now, after so many years.
To speak the truth I have suffered a
heart attack & have contemplated my life
with gravity & have not been proud of my
behavior in all cases.
Tears spring to her eyes.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, it’s him.52.
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
I am your father, Norma Jean.
(beat)
I have before me an interview with
‘Marilyn Monroe’ in the new ‘Pageant’.
Reading it, my eyes began to fill with
tears. You told that your mother is
hospitalized & you do not know your
father but ‘await him with every passing
hour’. My poor daughter, I did not know.
NORMA JEANE
It’s him. I knew. All those years.
Watching over me. I felt it.
(As the V.O. Continues, Norma Jeane becomes overwrought, and
a STUDIO DOCTOR is summoned to give her a SHOT.)
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
I will contact you again soon, Norma
Jeane, in person. Look for me, my precious
daughter, upon a special occasion in your
life when both Daughter and Father can
celebrate our long denied love.
Your Tearful Father.
CROWD (PRE-LAP)
Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn! Marilyn!
96 EXT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE. PREMIER NIGHT. 96
At the clamorous premiere of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes amid
klieg lights and camera flashes and whistles and hoots and
chants and applause; Mr Z.’s trusted Yvet, comes up stealthy
as a lion.
YVET
(yelling over the noise)
Marilyn. I’ve just learned. Be sure
to go alone to your hotel suite
tonight. Someone special will be
waiting for you there.
She cups a hand to her diamond laden ear:53.
NORMA JEANE
Someone s-special? Oh. Oh!
A glass sliver in the heart.
NORMA JEANE
Is it - my F-father?
But Yvet’s reply is drowned out by deafening music from the
loudspeakers: ‘Two Little Girls From Little Rock’. Yvete
presses her forefinger against her lips. A secret wink. And
then Norma Jeane is swallowed by the clamoring crowd and an
announcer’s amplified voice.
ANNOUNCER
Marilyn! Tell our radio audience:
Are you lonely tonight? When’re you
two gonna get married?
NORMA JEANE
M-married???
Laughter, cheers, whistles, and applause! She smiles, radiant
as a high-wattage light-bulb, and squints into the crowd
seeking him. If their eyes lock, she will know!
NORMA JEANE (PRE-LAP)
Is he here? My father?
97 INT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE. PREMIER NIGHT. 97
Sliding into her seat next to Mr Z, stitched into her dress
like a sausage:
NORMA JEANE (CONT’D)
...It’s like a happy ending. Of a
long confused movie.
MR. Z
Your father?
NORMA JEANE
I understand that I have a special
date after the party, in my hotel
suite.
As the house lights dim, shrewd Mr. Z smiles his secretive
smile, bringing a forefinger to his fleshy lips.
Big brassy swell of music.
CUT TO:54.
98 ‘GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES’ 20TH CENTURY FOX. 1953 98
‘Marilyn Monroe’ as ‘Lorelei-Lee’ performing ‘Diamonds are a
Girl’s Best Friend’; slapping away tuxedoed suitors with
heart-shaped boxes.
‘LORELEI-LEE’
NoooO!
No!No!No!No!No!No!No!
NO!
No!No!No!No!No!No!No!
CUT TO:
99 INT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE. (INTERCUT AS NEEDED) 99
NORMA JEANE
Oh, gosh! Is that me?
Staring up at the gigantic, gorgeous doll-woman looming above
the audience.
‘LORELEI-LEE’
A kiss on the hand maybe quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend...
A kiss may be grand.. but it won't pay the rental
on your humble flat
Or help you at the automat
But Norma Jeane’s smile begins to fade as she watches: What,
if he’s here in this crowd, must her father be thinking? Foam-
rubber Lorelei-Lee moving her body suggestively through this
Technicolor cartoon, this overproduced triumph of glitzy
vulgarity.
‘LORELEI-LEE’
Men grow cold as girls grow old
And we all lose our charms in the end
NORMA JEANE
Oh, Daddy. That thing on the
screen, it isn’t me.
What if he’s disgusted? What if he decides against meeting
his daughter after all?55.
‘LORELEI-LEE’
But square cut or pear shape
these rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend *
100 INT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE. LATER. 100
Applause. The house lights coming up. The audience loved it,
every slick phoney minute of it. ‘Marilyn’ is urged to her
feet by tuxedoed arms on either side. Look! Marilyn Monroe is
crying genuine tears! So deeply moved. Whistles, cheers, a
standing ovation.
Close on Norma Jeane, mortified:
NORMA JEANE
For this you killed your baby.
101 INT. PENTHOUSE FLOOR - BEVERLY WILSHIRE. NIGHT. 101
She hurries down the corridor, her heart pounding - like a
bird’s - so rapidly - she worries she might faint. She
fumbles the key in the lock.
102 INT. IMPERIAL SUITE - BEVERLY WILSHIRE. NIGHT. 102
She enters, frightened.
NORMA JEANE
H-hello? Who is it?
He’s seated in shadow on a velvet love seat, a dozen long
stemmed roses, a silver ice bucket, a bottle of champagne.
She’s in childish terror, he rises awkwardly to his feet.
They speak at the same time:
NORMA JEANE MAN
D-daddy? Baby?
He steps forward into the light: Of course, it is the Ex-
Athlete.
NORMA JEANE
O-oh, it’s you - you decided to
come, after all?
He’s nervous, excited, he’s holding something in his hand.56.
THE EX-ATHLETE
Marilyn, I want you to be happy.
NORMA JEANE
Oh! - but I am happy, I’ve been
happy all my l-life
He’s brought her a ringbox. She laughs nervously as it’s *
opened. *
THE EX-ATHLETE
Marilyn. We love each other, it’s
time we were married.
There is an uncomfortable pause. A nervous squeaky laugh:
NORMA JEANE
I g-guess!
The Blonde Actress is crying, suddenly. The Ex-Athlete is *
deeply moved, and does what lovers do in sappy movies, he *
kisses away her tears. *
THE EX-ATHLETE *
I just love you so much. I just *
want to protect you from these *
jackals. I just want to take you *
away from all this. *
CUT TO: *

Norma Jeane, graciously signing the magazine for a nurse, in
the airy sweeping script of ‘Marilyn.’
NURSE
Oh, Miss Baker! Thank you.
105 INT. CORRIDOR - NORWALK HOSPITAL. DAY. 105
Norma Jeane follows the nurse down the hospital corridor.
NURSE
Your Mother is awake and eager to
see you.
(MORE)57.
NURSE (cont'd)
(brightly-smiling)
She had a ‘bad spell’ recently, but
she’s come out of it almost one
hundred percent.
106 INT. GLADYS’ ROOM - NORWALK HOSPITAL. DAY. 106
Norma Jeane embraces her mother, feeling those frail bird
bones. She’s surprised and pleased to see, propped up against
a mirror, the framed wedding photo of herself and the Ex-
Athlete: She didn’t throw it away! She must love me.
Gladys chuckles.
GLADYS
That man is your husband? Does he
know about you?
NORMA JEANE
No.
Gladys nods gravely.
GLADYS
That’s good then.
107 EXT. GROUNDS - NORWALK HOSPITAL. DAY. 107
They walk together.
NORMA JEANE
I may be quitting the movies. ‘At
the height of my fame.’ My husband
wants me to. He wants a wife, and
he wants a mother. I mean - a
mother for his children. That’s
what I want too.
Gladys cuts in abruptly:
GLADYS
(pointing)
That bench? I used to sit there.
But somebody was killed there.
NORMA JEANE
Killed?
GLADYS
They hurt you if you don’t obey. If
you don’t swallow their poison.
(MORE)58.
GLADYS (cont'd)
If you keep it in the side of your
mouth and refuse to swallow. That’s
forbidden.
Norma Jeane’s face, thinking: Oh no. Please no.
GLADYS
People come into my room at night,
they’re making a film of me. And
doing ‘things’ to me with surgical
instruments. But I’m lucky;
nobody’s killed me. They respect
patients with family. I’m a VIP
here. The nurses are always cooing
‘Oh, when is Marilyn coming to see
you, Gladys’ I say, ‘How should I
know? I’m just her mother.’ They
were asking about the baseball
player, was Marilyn going to marry
him; I said, ‘Go ask her yourself,
it means so much to you. Maybe
she’ll make you all bridesmaids.’
Norma Jeane laughs despite herself.
NORMA JEANE
Mother, let’s sit down. There’s a
nice bench here.
GLADYS
Nice bench!
(snorts)
Sometimes, Norma Jeane, you sound
like such a fool. Like the rest of
them.
NORMA JEANE
It’s only a way of t-talking,
Mother.
GLADYS
Then learn a smarter way. You’re no
fool.
They sit.
GLADYS
(beat)
You didn’t have the baby, did you?
I dreamt it died.
NORMA JEANE
I had a miscarriage, Mother. In my
sixth week. I was terribly sick.59.
Gladys nods gravely.
GLADYS
It was a necessary decision.
NORMA JEANE
(sharp)
It was a miscarriage, Mother!
GLADYS
I can’t be one of them, Norma
Jeane, I can’t promise.
NORMA JEANE
Promise what? I don’t understand.
GLADYS
I can’t be one of them. A
grandmother. It’s my punishment.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, Mother, what are you saying?
Punishment for what?
GLADYS
For giving my beautiful daughter
away. For letting her die.
Off Norma Jeane’s reaction:
CUT TO:
108 INT. HOUSE IN BEL AIR. DAY. 108
*
She swarms into his warm muscled arms. He’s startled.
NORMA JEANE
I just feel so...weak, I guess! Oh,
Daddy!
He’s embarrassed, not knowing what to say.
THE EX-ATHLETE
What’s wrong Marilyn? I don’t get
it.
She shivers and burrows into him.
THE EX-ATHLETE
Honey, what the hell? I don’t get
it.60.
109 INT. HOUSE IN BEL AIR. ANOTHER DAY. 109
She reads to him a poem she’s written. In her yearning girl’s
voice.
NORMA JEANE
In you
The world is born anew.
As two.
Before you
there was but one.
On his face: What is he to say? What the hell? *
INT. HOUSE IN BEL AIR. ANOTHER DAY. *
In the crowded living room with his family; so much shouting, *
laughing, jostling, kids running in and out, she looks over *
at him, like: help me! I’m drowning. His niece asks: *
HIS NIECE *
Hey Marilyn, what’s it like being a *
movie star? *
She blushes, tongue-tied with embarrassment. *
NORMA JEANE *
Oh, I’m not a s-star. I’m j-just *
some blonde. *
HIS NIECE *
(scornful) *
Oh, yeah. So the hair’s real? *
IN THE KITCHEN... *
...with HIS MOMMA, HIS ELDERLY GRANDMOTHER, HIS AUNTS. *
NORMA JEANE *
People make pasta? I mean - not *
just in a store? *
HIS AUNT hands her a marinated egg from the refrigerator. *
NORMA JEANE *
Oh, is this to eat? I mean-standing *
up? *61.
HIS MOMMA (PRE-LAP) *
She’ll boil pasta to mush if you *
don’t watch her every second. *
INT. LIVING ROOM. *
He listens to his Momma’s litany of complaints: *
HIS MOMMA (CONT’D) *
...She thinks garlic and onions are *
the same thing! She thinks olive *
oil is the same as melted *
margarine! (throws up her hands) *
Well, it’s none of my business. *
(Returns to the kitchen) *
See? He blames me! *
110 IN THE BEDROOM... 110 *
He stumbles over clothes of hers he’s never seen her wear.
Tissues caked with make-up! He starts cleaning up...
111 IN THE BATHROOM... 111 *
...ugly splotches of makeup in the sink, a toothpaste tube
without the cap, blonde hairs in the brushes and combs, empty
pill bottles. For Christ’s sake, she’s forgotten to flush the
toilet!
112 INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. 112
NORMA JEANE (CONT’D)
Daddy, it’s so scary: How a scene
with actual people just goes on and
on? Like on a bus? What’s to stop
it? Or how to figure out what
people mean, when probably they
don’t mean anything? Not like a
script; there’s no point, it just
‘happens’. Like the weather?
He understands what she’s saying. Sort of.
THE EX-ATHLETE
In boxing they say ‘that got his
attention.’ When a guy is hit hard.
It’s about attention.
Concentration. And if you don’t
have that-?62.
She’s looking at him smiling and confused, like he’s speaking
a foreign language!
THE EX-ATHLETE (PRE-LAP)
What is this? Blackmail? Extortion?
113 INT. VILLAR’S STEAKHOUSE. BEVERLY HILLS. DAY. 113 *
The Ex-Athlete in the empty restaurant, with a ‘Photography
Dealer’, pondering a plain brown envelope.
‘PHOTOGRAPHY DEALER’
It’s just a business transaction.
You pay, slugger. And I deliver the
negatives.
The Ex-Athlete opens the envelope and looks at the
photographs: Calender-art nudes, she’s so young! Hardly more
than a kid. A sweet-faced trusting girl, baring her breasts,
revealing her pubic hair...
THE EX-ATHLETE
(quietly)
I can have you hurt. You
cocksucker.
‘PHOTOGRAPHY DEALER’
Hey, now. That’s not the right
attitude.
The Ex-Athlete says nothing.
‘PHOTOGRAPHY DEALER’
I’m on your side. And the lady’s
too. She’s a real high class lady,
in fact. What I feel strongly is,
these negatives should be off the
market so they can’t be
misappropriated.
114 INT. HOUSE IN BEL AIR. DAY. 114
He comes home to a whirl-wind; strewn across the carpet are
items of clothing, damp towels, books; Origin of the Species,
by Charles Darwin - what the hell is that? Science Fiction?
She’s in the bedroom doing dance exercises, for Christ sake!
She turns a bright actressy smile on him.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, hey! Where’d you go to?63.
His hand shoots out and slaps her across the jaw.
She stumbles and cringes backwards, sitting down hard on the
bed. Her face as white as a piece of china the instant before
it shatters.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, Daddy. It’s my fault. I-I don’t
know how the room got this way.
I’ve been sick, I guess.
He holds up the envelope.
THE EX-ATHLETE
These photos. Is that what you are?
Meat?
NORMA JEANE
Daddy, no! I don’t want to be.
THE EX-ATHLETE
Tell them you won’t. This new
movie. No deal.
NORMA JEANE
Daddy, I have to work. It’s my
life.
THE EX-ATHLETE
Tell them you want good roles.
Serious roles. Tell them you’re
quitting. Your husband says you’re
quitting.
NORMA JEANE
Yes. Yes, I will tell them.
He softens, sits next to her on the bed, can’t she
understand...
THE EX-ATHLETE
It’s just that I love you so much.
I can’t bear to see you cheapen
yourself.
She’s nodding, she’s agreeing, but...
115 IN THE BLINDING WHITE LIGHTS (ON LEXINGTON & 51ST ST) 115
She’s the Girl With No Name, standing with her legs apart on
a New York subway grating. Her blonde head is thrown
rapturously back as an updraft lifts her full, flaring skirt,
exposing white cotton panties. White cotton!64.
At the edge of the light, at the edge of civility, behind
barricades, there’s a crowd, a rouge-elephant crowd restless
and aroused. Men in a pack. Men through whom, massed, sexual
desire passes like an agitated wave through water. There’s a
smouldering mood. There’s an angry mood. There’s a mood-to-do-
hurt. There’s a mood-to-grab-and-tear-and-fuck.
And in the glaring white lights, focused upon her, upon her
alone, we can see the shadow, just the shadow, of the
bleached crotch: For the hair there is...
Blonde
The roar of the crowd rises and falls with her skirt.
And there, with the other men, anonymous like them, is the
Husband. On fire.
116 INT. SUITE WALDORF-ASTORIA. NIGHT. 116
She’s coming in the door, after a long night, with that soft
breathy guilty voice.
NORMA JEANE
Ohhh, Daddy, gosh, I’m sorry -
keeping you waiting so long.
His hands leap out, both hands, balled into fists. She backs
away from him begging. The doll eyes shiny with fear.
NORMA JEANE
No. Daddy, don’t. See, I’m working
Tomorrow. Everybody will know if -
Because she’s resisting him. Provoking him. Shielding her
face from the justice of his blows.
THE EX-ATHLETE
Whore! Are you proud? Showing your
crotch like that! On the street! My
wife -
knocking her out of frame, following after her, leaving us to
contemplate the crystal chandeliers as they quiver overhead
from the fury of the beating. Live sound out, we hear the
familiar voice:
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
My Dear Daughter Norma Jeane,
(MORE)65.
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.) (cont'd)
I did not see your ‘new movie’ - the
vulgar title & publicity attending it, giant
billboards & crude likeness of you posed
with you dress lifted for all the world to
see your private parts did not make me
wish to purchase a ticket.
I will say, I had hoped to meet your
husband! I have been an admirer of his
for many years. I was very disappointed
that your marriage to this stellar athlete
ended in divorce & such ugly publicity.
At least there were no children to reap
the shame.
FADE TO BLACK.
SUPER: NEW YORK CITY, 1955
FADE IN:
117 INT. BROWNSTONE. DAY. 117
THE PLAYWRIGHT checks the papers on his desk. ‘A Poem for
Magda’ is where he left it: More than three hundred pages of
script, revisions, and notes. He lifts it, and a snapshot
falls out - ballpoint on the back of it reads:
Magda, June 1930:
It’s in black-and-white, of an attractive blond girl with
wide-set eyes.
He looks at her longingly.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Magda.
118 EXT. NEW YORK ENSEMBLE. DAY. 118
Eager as a young lover, though no longer young, the
Playwright hurries up the fight of metal stairs and into...66.
119 ...THE LOFT REHEARSAL SPACE 119
...A babble of voices, a haze of faces. He has to pause to
calm his heart. To compose himself. He isn’t in condition to
run up stairs as he used to.
120 INT. STAGE. NEW YORK ENSEMBLE. DAY. 120
Six actors on folding chairs on a raised platform, in a semi
circle beneath bare bulbs. The sound of their dialogue fades
away as the Playwright, seated in the front row, begins to
stare at the Blonde Actress. She’s been placed at the center
of the semicircle, as if for protection. He stares at her,
now recognizing her, a heavy blush darkening his face.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
(shocked)
Marilyn Monroe? Here?
Norma Jeane holds herself unnaturally still. She has no lines
in the first scene. She’s nervous. Her eyes glisten with
withheld tears.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
My Magda? Her?
He glances furiously at PEARLMAN, the Great Director, who
leans against a wall close by, watching the scene with rapt
absorption.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
He’s in love with her. The bastard.
He looks back to the Blonde Actress as she opens her mouth,
and draws her breath, to speak her first line.
Freeze frame:
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Not my Magda!
121 TIME JUMP: 121
The House lights come up. The audience applauds. Many get to
their feet. The playwright removes his glasses and wipes the
tears from his eyes with his sleeve. Without his glasses, he
sees the loft as a pulsing swirl of novalike lights and
blurred motion and darkness. He sees no faces, he recognizes
no one. He rises to his feet to escape. Glasses on now, he
sees the Blonde Actress’ yearning eyes snatching at him as he
flees; out of the rehearsal room...67.
122 ...DOWN THE STEEP METAL STAIRS. 122
123 ON 51ST STREET (NIGHT)... 123
...He steps into a wall of head hammering cold. There, across
the street, above a movie marquee; looms a fifty foot
plasterboard blowup of ‘Marilyn Monroe’ in her notorious
‘Seven Year Itch’ pose. Laughing, blonde Marilyn standing,
legs apart, her pleated ivory skirt flying up to reveal her
white cotton panties.
THE PLAYWRIGHT (PRE-LAP)
This play. It’s become my life. For
an artist, that’s fatal.
124 INT. RESTAURANT, WEST 70TH & BROADWAY. NIGHT. 124
They are seated in a booth. He with his thinning hair, a
figure of dignity, with something wounded, ravaged in his
face.
THE PLAYWRIGHT (CONT’D)
It’s just that I don’t think I’ll
ever finish it now. Some of those
scenes were written a quarter of a
century ago. Before, almost, you
were born. Magda was my own first
love, never consummated. Never even
really declared! She’d be, if she’s
still alive, in her mid-fifties.
Beautiful Magda, middle-
aged!(laughs)
NORMA JEANE
(hesitant)
I had some ideas about M-magda? If
you’re interested?
Ideas? From an actress?
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Of course I’m interested. You’re
very kind to care.
Out of her handbag she takes a copy of ‘A Poem for Magda’ and
places it on the tabletop between them.
NORMA JEANE
This girl Magda. She’s like Natasha
in ‘The Three Sisters’?
(MORE)68.
NORMA JEANE (cont'd)
The one they laugh at because her
dress is the wrong color. Except
with Magda, it’s the way she speaks
English.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
(defensive)
Who told you that?
NORMA JEANE
What?
THE PLAYWRIGHT
About ‘The Three Sisters’ and my
play.
NORMA JEANE
Nobody.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Pearlman? That I’d been influenced?
NORMA JEANE
Oh no, I r-read the play myself. I
always thought I could play
Natasha?
The Playwright says nothing. His offended heart beats hard.
NORMA JEANE
I was thinking, what Chekhov does
with Natasha, he surprises you
because Natasha turns out so strong
and devious. And cruel. But your
Magda... she never changes much.
She’s always so good.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
(curt)
Yes. Magda is good. Was good. The
original. It wouldn’t have occurred
to her to be angry.
Rebuked, The Blonde Actress can only agree.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, yes.
She understands! Magda is superior to her, a higher form than
herself.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
(trying to keep the irony
out of his voice)
(MORE)69.
THE PLAYWRIGHT (cont'd)
And what other thoughts do you have
about Magda?
NORMA JEANE
I guess... I said something wrong?
About Natasha?
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Certainly not. It’s helpful.
NORMA JEANE
Your play is nothing like ...that
one.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
No, it isn’t. I’ve never much been
drawn to Chekhov.
She has one more thing to say. Does she dare say it?
NORMA JEANE
One thing I was thinking? Magda
wouldn’t know how to read? Issac
could show his p-poem to her, and
she’s only pretending to read it?
His temple pounds...
THE PLAYWRIGHT
...Oh my God! She was illiterate.
Suddenly tears spring to his eyes. There is a well of grief,
thirty years deep.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
That was it! She was illiterate. Of
course!
He looks at her, so grateful, so moved. How he underestimated
her. He laughs:
THE PLAYWRIGHT
I should call you Marilyn,
shouldn’t I? Or is that just a
stage name?
NORMA JEANE
You could call me Norma. That’s my
true name.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
I could call you Norma, if you
prefer. Or, I could call you...’My
Magda’.70.
A dazzling smile:
NORMA JEANE
Oh, I’d like that.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
My secret Magda.
NORMA JEANE
Yes!
THE PLAYWRIGHT
But Maybe ‘Marilyn’ when others are
around. So there wouldn’t be any
misunderstanding.
NORMA JEANE
When others are around, it doesn’t
matter what you call me. You can
whistle. You can call me, ‘Hey
you!’
He puts his wedding-ringed hand on hers.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Hey you.
NORMA JEANE
Hey you.
125 INT. BROWNSTONE. DAY. 125
His frumpy wife, Esther, banging through the door with a
suitcase. Returning from wherever she’d been.
ESTHER
Miss me?
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Of course.
ESTHER
Yes. (She laughs) I can see.
Off the Playwrights guilty face:
CUT TO:
126 (NEWSREEL FOOTAGE)EXT.RENTED HOUSE, UPSTATE NEW YORK DAY. 126
Quick cuts of Photographers, Cameramen, Journalists, in a
frenzy.71.
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Putting and end to all speculation,
Marilyn Monroe confirms that she
will soon marry.
The Playwright and The Blonde Actress being interviewed on
the lawn of a rented house.
INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
Could you tell us what kind of
wedding you’re going to have?
NORMA JEANE
(shy, childlike)
Very quiet I hope.
127 EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. DAY. 127
...And the view of the ocean beyond. She’s excited,
childlike:
NORMA JEANE
Oh! This is so beautiful. Oh,
Daddy, I don’t ever want to leave.
128 THE ROCKY SHORE BELOW THE CLIFF. DAY. 128
The vast open water of the Atlantic. Light reflected off the
water like metal. They stand shivering in the ocean wind.
NORMA JEANE
(fiercely)
Oh, I love you.
She takes his hand and presses it against her belly.
NORMA JEANE
We love you.
CUT TO:
129 ‘BABY’: TWO MONTHS, SIX DAYS IN THE WOMB. 129
CUT TO:
130 NORMA JEANE... 130
Her pale hair whipping in the wind....72.
NORMA JEANE
Daddy, come on!
...as she climbs up the cliff, amid slippery, mossy rocks and
ocean debris.
NORMA JEANE
Baby’s hungry. He wants his momma
to eat.
131 INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. DAY. 131
She devours mashed potatoes with chunks of unsalted butter.
NORMA JEANE
Baby makes his wishes known. Norma
is just the vessel.
She cleans her plate and presents it to him proudly.
NORMA JEANE
Am I your good girl, Daddy?
He laughs and kisses her.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
You’re my good girl, darling. My
only love.
132 INT. LIVING ROOM - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. NIGHT. 132
They’re on the couch. She’s running her hand up and down
inside his trousers.
NORMA JEANE
(baby, breathy voice)
Oh, Daddy. Oh.
(uncertain)
You love me I guess?
(giggling)
Cause I’m your blond shik-sta?
(with passion, in his ear)
O, Daddy. Before you I wasn’t
anyone. I wasn’t born.
133 INT. BABY’S ROOM - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. DAY. 133
He looks for her in Baby’s room; A wicker rocking cradle,
Little stuffed toys, old children’s books, Once upon a
time...73.
134 INT. BATHROOM - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. DAY. 134
He pushes open the bathroom door. She’s inside, naked,
stomach bulging, she turns to him startled.
NORMA JEANE
Oh! Hey.
In the palm of one hand several pills, and in the other a
plastic cup.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Darling, I thought you weren’t
taking anything? Any more?
She meets his eyes in the mirror.
NORMA JEANE
These are vitamins, daddy. And cod-
liver oil capsules.
135 INT. STUDY - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. ANOTHER DAY. 135
Norma Jeane enters the Playwright’s study; trespassing. In
guilty excitement she sits at the playwrights’ typewriter,
looking at the papers strewn across his desk so real like the
scattered thoughts of genius. Her eye involuntarily skims-
X.: Daddy, you won’t ever write about me, will you?
Y.: Darling, of course not. Why would I do such a thing?
X.: It’s what people do. Sometimes. Writers.
Y.: I’m not other people. You and I are not other people.
On her face, betrayed:
THE PLAYWRIGHT (PRE-LAP)
Where do you go when you disappear?74.
136 INT. BEDROOM - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. NIGHT. 136
She’s in the bed, shivering in his arms:
NORMA JEANE
Don’t make me go back, Daddy. I
never want to be her again. I got
out with my life last time, but
only just barely.
INT. BEDROOM - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. NIGHT. *
As they make love, she sees a crack forming in the ceiling. *
THE PLAYWRIGHT (PRE-LAP) *
She’s wonderful... *
137 INT. STUDY - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. ANOTHER DAY. 137
He’s on the phone, talking to a friend:
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Pregnancy agrees with her. Even *
morning sickness, she’s cheerful
about. She says;
‘this is how it’s supposed to be, I
guess.’
He watches Norma Jeane out on the back lawn cutting flowers
with shears. His beautiful pregnant wife.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
If I have one regret, it’s that
time passes so quickly.
138 EXT. OUTSIDE ON THE LAWN. CONTINUOUS. 138
She feels an eerie ticklish sensation that means (maybe)
someone is watching her. She looks up at the second floor of
the house; to the Playwright’s study, where he’s placed a
desk by the window. She’s a little scared, maybe, a little
tense.
139 INSERT: 139
Baby in her womb, gripping her tight.75.
BABY (V.O.)
You won’t hurt me this time will
you? Not do what you did, last
time?
NORMA JEANE
I didn’t. I didn’t mean to.
BABY (V.O.)
Yes, you meant to. It was your
decision.
NORMA JEANE
You’re not the same baby. You’re
this baby.
BABY (V.O.)
That was me. It’s always me.
BACK TO SCENE:
She puts a hand on her belly to comfort him.
NORMA JEANE
Shhh. He loves us. He would die for
us. He’s said so.
She goes back to cutting flowers with her shears.
140 INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. SOON AFTER. 140
She enters, happily:
NORMA JEANE
Look, Daddy! Look what I have.
Flowers make people feel welcome.
Like they’re wanted.
Norma Jeane begins to arrange the hydrangeas, but they keep
falling out of the vases.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Darling, you’ve cut the stems a
little too short. See?
She’s deflated at once. She shrinks back like a struck child.
Her happy mood crushed.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, what did I... What?
He opens a cupboard.76.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Look. We can repair the damage.
Like this.
He arranges the blossoms in shallow bowls, flower heads
floating. She watches him, stroking her belly, her lower lip
caught between her teeth.
NORMA JEANE
It’s all right to do it, like that?
Flowers like that? Nobody will l-
laugh?
He turns to look at her.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Laugh? Why would anyone laugh?
141 EXT. PORCH - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. DUSK. 141
Their friends RUDY and JEAN arrive, embrace the Playwright.
142 EXT. PORCH - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. DUSK. 142
The Playwright is drinking with RUDY and JEAN: *
RUDY
Where’s Norma gone to?
JEAN
(hand on the Playwright’s
arm)
She’s so adorable. And nothing like
you expect.
RUDY
So well read! She’s read my latest
book, in fact.
143 INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. SOON AFTER. 143
He finds her hiding in the alcove, flattening grocery bags.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Darling, aren’t you going to come
sit with us? On the porch? Why are
you here?
NORMA JEANE
Oh, I’m coming, Daddy! I was
just...77.
Trying to keep the irritation out of his voice:
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Darling, it isn’t necessary to make
so much of this visit. You know
Rudy and Jean.
NORMA JEANE
They don’t like me, Daddy. They’ve
come to see you.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Norma don’t be ridiculous. They’ve
come to see us both.
She shakes her head.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Darling, just come, will you?
They’re waiting.
Again she shakes her head. She is watching him sidelong, like
a frightened cat, about to bolt.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Darling, just come out with me, eh?
You’re looking very beautiful.
At last she shivers, and laughs, and rubs her forehead
against his chin. She takes from the table a large heavy
platter of raw vegetables geometrically arranged by color,
and he carries drinks on a tray.
144 EXT. PORCH - SUMMER HOUSE - GALAPAGOS COVE. SOON AFTER. 144
Their friends Rudy and Jean, admiring a view of the ocean,
turn now to see the handsome couple approach: The Playwright
and the Blonde Actress. She is radiantly beautiful, wearing a
floral print dress, and she smiles at them as if dazed by
flashbulbs, and in that instant she stumbles on the porch
step and the platter slips from her hands and crashes to the
floor, vegetables, dip and broken crockery flying.
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Norma!
She’s at the bottom of the steps, moaning and writhing. THE *
FLOWERS ON HER DRESS SEEM TO BE BLOOMING. She touches them *
and her fingers come away BLOODY. Suddenly she understands *
what’s happening: *
NORMA JEANE *
Help me! Save the baby! *78.
She screams, as if in a nightmare, and HER HAIR TURNS *
COMPLETELY WHITE! *
NORMA JEANE *
Daddy, for God’s sake! Deliver the *
baby! *
There is a roaring, like a waterfall in her ears. And *

She plucks the wrong notes on the ridiculous ukulele, bursts
into tears, and pounds her thighs.
NORMA JEANE
You think, I’m too dumb to
comprehend that the joke’s on me?
Jell-O on springs?!!!!!!!!!!
She begins to scream like a creature being killed, and in a
fury tears at her fine-blown hair, brittle as spun glass, and
she rakes her nails across her sweet baby-face cosmetic mask.
W himself runs forward to prevent her.
W
No! Marilyn, for God’s sake.
DOC FELL, the studio physician, appears with a NURSE and
leads his hysterically weeping patient away.
149 INT. HER DRESSING ROOM. DAY. 149
She holds Whitey’s hand as Doc Fell gives up on her bleeding
inner arm, and sinks the long piercing needle into an artery
just below her ear.
DOC FELL
Miss Monroe, only just hold still.
There.
She closes her eyes and goes to sleep on the couch as
‘Marilyn’ dressed only her underpants, bare breasts exposed,
and her body covered in sweat.80.
150 INT. BEDROOM - HOUSE ON WHITTIER DRIVE. DAY. 150
She wakes, as Norma Jeane, to a scene of devastation wrought
by some stranger, a madwoman, who has dumped makeup jars and
powder and talcum onto the floor, yanked clothes off hangers
in the closet, torn pages from books and scattered them on
the carpet, and the mirror’s cracked where a fist has been
pounded against it (Yes, Norma Jeane’s fist is bruised) and
across the wall there’s a long crimson smear, like a savage
shout.
151 INT. HOUSE ON WHITTIER DRIVE. DAY. 151
A faceless man follows her around the house, (he literally
has no face) the faraway sound of his voice, droning on like
the buzz of a fly:
THE PLAYWRIGHT
What can I do to help you, darling?
...to help us ...It seems every day
since Maine we’re growing more and
more distant ...I’m so worried
about you, darling ...Your health
...These drugs. ...Are you trying
to destroy yourself Norma? ...What
are you doing to your life?
At last she turns on him and angrily pushes at him.
NORMA JEANE
What business of yours is my life?!

So many people! So many! Why did

156 INT. CAR (MOVING). TWILIGHT. 156
She’s driving blindly, through miles of residential
neighborhoods. Looking for him in all the men on the street.82.
NORMA JEANE
‘See? - Norma Jeane, that man is
your father. ’
In tears, a migraine coming on, certain she’ll recognize him
if she sees him. Another man, another...
NORMA JEANE
That man is your father, Norma
Jeane.

Your tearful and loving father!!!
She spins the wheel in a fury and veers dangerously toward *
cars parked on the sidewalk: *

Crunch! Crunch! Crunch! She smashes into three cars in a row. *
Reverses back and then smashes again! Finally getting out of *

She’s woken naked in the sheets of a dishevelled bed. In a

pisses noisily into a toilet bowl. The T.V. Droning on and
on, The Democratic Nominee for President:
NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT (ON TV)
...this new frontier, of which I
speak, is not a set of promises -
it is a set of challenges. It sums
up not what I intend to offer the
American people, but what I intend
to ask of them...
The Pissing Man comes into the room and looks at her hand
wistfully.
PISSING MAN
Is that a wedding ring?83.
NORMA JEANE
I’m a filmcutter. I’m married to
the Studio.
PISSING MAN
(impressed)
You ever see any movie stars on the
job?
NORMA JEANE
No, never. Only on film, cutting
and splicing pieces of film, and
they’re nothing but images on
celluloid.
159 EXT. STUDIO CAR/HOUSE ON WHITTIER DRIVE. DAY. 159
Returning to the house on Whittier drive, she has to be
assisted, by the Driver, to the door, which is opened
abruptly by an anxious man of middle age whose features
immediately disappear from his face:
NORMA JEANE
Who are you?
THE PLAYWRIGHT
Darling, I’m your husband.
160 INT. BEDROOM - HOUSE ON WHITTIER DRIVE. CONTINUOUS. 160
Entering to the incessantly ringing phone which she yanks off
the hook:
NORMA JEANE
Hello? ................No Marilyn
Monroe will not be in coming today
to impersonate and demean herself
and you will have to shoot around
her.
She hangs up, and the phone immediately begins to ring again
so she takes it and shoves it in the top drawer of her bureau
and slams it shut. Suddenly she’s horrified; the ringing,
sealed up, entombed in the drawer, sounds like a baby crying.
161 THROUGH HER WINDOW: 161
She sees: A car pulling up outside.
NORMA JEANE (PRE-LAP)
Oh Whitey!84.
162 INT. BEDROOM - HOUSE ON WHITTIER DRIVE. SOON AFTER. 162
What a relief to see Whitey! Beloved Whitey! He sees her
misery and the absence of all magic from her sallow,
frightened face.
WHITEY
Miss Monroe, don’t be upset. It
will all be all right, I promise.
She bursts into tears and begins speaking addled nonsense:
NORMA JEANE
Oh, Whitey! Must ‘Sugar Kane’ want
to get there, more I’m meaning than
life itself.
But Whitey understands exactly what she means.
WHITEY
Come, Miss Monroe, and lets lie
down. I promise, I’ll conjure up
‘Marilyn’ within the hour.
She lies on the bed, in a prone posture, like in a mortuary -
and Whitey the embalmer laboring over her. Tears begin to
leak from the corners of her eyes.
NORMA JEANE
Baby’s gone, baby’s gone.
WHITEY
Tsk, tsk, Miss Monroe.
163 TIME JUMP: 163
Whitey leads the trembling beggar-maid to the vanity and his
practiced hands go to work on her.
164 TIME JUMP: 164
She sits before the mirror, trembling lower lip, eyes lowered
in prayer.
NORMA JEANE
(whispering)
Please come. Please. Don’t abandon
me. Please!
Begging the very one she scorns. This ‘Marilyn’ she despises.
Whitey’s voice begins to quicken with excitement.85.
WHITEY
She’s coming! She’s almost here!
And there in the mirror, laughing at the beggar-maid’s fears,
is the most beautiful face she’s ever seen, a wonder of a
face, the face of the Fair Princess:
WHITEY
............Marilyn!
165 INT. SOUNDSTAGE. VERY LATE IN THE DAY. 165
She appears at last, fragile and breathless, and without
apology. Pretty Brooklyn-boy C, glares at her: He’s been
forced to stand around all day in high heels and female drag,
like a cross between Frankenstein and Joan Crawford. She
laughs at him.
NORMA JEANE
(words scrambled)
Now you know what it’s to be a
woman like. Laughed at!
CUT TO:
166 DAILIES ‘SOME LIKE IT HOT’ (INTERCUT LATER WITH SET) 166

Huh?

Off her scream, we...
CUT TO:
167 EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD! PREMIERE NIGHT! 167
CROWD
Mari-LYN! Mari-LYN! Mari-LYN!
Thousands of people line the Boulevard, pressing up against
LAPD barricades to stare in wonderment at the motorcade! As
the limousines near Graumans, there’s a quickening beat in
the air, the noise becomes deafening, the gigantic heartbeat
of the crowd accelerates...
CROWD
Mari-LYN! Mari-LYN! Mari-LYN!
168 IN THE LIMOUSINE... 168
...She recognizes her kinsmen outside, reaching out to her
with their claws, their popping flashbulbs. She begins
clambering over Mr Z’s bony knees, clawing at the limo door,
trying to roll down the window, as Mr Z protests:87.
MR. Z
(pulling her away)
Marilyn! What are you doing, for
God’s sake!
She has to yell over the seething, cheering, ecstatic waves:
CROWD (O.S.)
Mari-LYN! Mari-LYN! Mari-LYN!
NORMA JEANE
(laughing)
Do you remember hurting me, Mr. Z?
Don’t you remember? In your office?
All those years ago?
Bat-faced Mr. Z silently shakes his head.
NORMA JEANE
You don’t? You don’t remember?
MR. Z
I’m afraid I do not, Miss Monroe.
NORMA JEANE
The blood on your white fur rug,
you don’t remember?
MR. Z
I’m afraid not, Miss Monroe. I have
no white fur rug.
Only now do we reveal The Husband, beside her, uncomfortable
in his tuxedo. She laughs:
NORMA JEANE
Poor Sap!
He leans toward her, indicating that he hasn’t heard amid the
screams&cheers&noise of the police bullhorns and she says in
his ear:
NORMA JEANE
-Wasn’t-talking-to-you.
169 EXT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE. NIGHT. 169
Applause washes around her like maddened surf as she emerges
from the limo into a cataclysm of light, smiling, waving, as
the chant increases to deafening volume - Mari-Lyn! Mari-lyn!
This crowd adoring her: Troll people, creatures of the under-
earth.88.
Hunchbacked gnomes & Beggar-maids & homeless females with mad
eyes & straw hair. Disfigured faces & shrunken limbs &
glaring eyes & holes for mouths. (Digital effect.)
‘MARILYN’
(smiling, waving)
Oh, Hey! Oh, I love you! Love love
love you all!
170 INT. GRAUMAN’S CHINESE THEATRE. NIGHT. 170
The film passes in a blur, an undercranked, mad-cap,
ephedrine blur, the accelerated motion halting only for Joe
E. Brown’s classic final line...
JOE E. BROWN
Nobody’s perfect.
...Then back to Keystone Kops acceleration; for the standing
ovation, the crowd clapping insanely fast, waterfalls of
applause, the Blonde Actress bowing.
171 EXT. AFTER PARTY. NIGHT. 171
The party has a brittle speedy edge (rotated shutter). The
people seem sharp, their movements like razor blades.
TUXEDO
Congratulations.
TUXEDO #2
Marilyn, congratulations!
TUXEDO #3
Marilyn baby! Con-grat-u-la-tions!
She laughs happily, champagne squirting out of her nostrils.
The Playwright following like a lap dog.
NORMA JEANE
I’m here, I’m still alive.
we glide past stars of the period: MARLON BRANDO!, AUDREY *
HEPBURN!, BOGEY & BETTY!!! (rotoscoped in), bumping into *
Clark Gable, handsome & mature in his tux & smiling in
gentlemanly mystification at her girlish stammer:
NORMA JEANE
Ohhhh, Mr. G-gable. I’m so
embarrassed. You saw the movie?
(MORE)89.
NORMA JEANE (cont'd)
That fat blonde pig up on the
screen, that wasn’t me. Next time,
I’ll do better, I promise.
CUT TO BLACK
FADE IN:
172 (NEWSREEL FOOTAGE) DIVORCE PRESS CONFERENCE; 1 72
LAWN OF RENTED HOUSE. DAY.
Her Lawyer and Studio Personal attempt to calm the dozens of
Journalists outside the frame.
STUDIO P.R. MAN.
Miss Monroe will not discuss her
former husband. Either of her
former husbands. Except to say that
she infinitely respects them.
A ripple of excitement as she appears. She is dressed in
black, white-skinned as a geisha, agitated and distraught.
‘MARILYN MONROE’
They are g-great men. Great
Americans. I revere them as human
beings of fame and achievement in
their fields though I c-could not
remain married to them as a woman.
Oh - I’m sorry. Oh, forgive me! I c-
can’t say anything more.
Overcome, she hides her face. Dozens of cameras flash
simultaneously; the effect of a miniature A-Bomb!
173 EXT. LAWN OF RENTED HOUSE. DAY. 173
The Blonde Actress is being quickly escorted by her two male
companions to the waiting limousine. The journalists press
forward now, lunging out of control like maddened dogs, a
pack, frenzied shouts:
JOURNALIST#1
Miss Monroe, one question please!
JOURNALIST#2
Marilyn, wait!
JOURNALIST#3
Marilyn, tell our listeners in
radio land: will Marlon Brando be
your next?90.
Despite Studio Security Guards fending off the crowd, a wily
little Reporter manages to slip under her Attorney’s arm and
thrust a microphone into the Blonde Actress’ face with such
violence that he strikes her mouth. BIG CLOSE UP: Her tooth
is chipped!
LITTLE REPORTER
(Italian accent)
Marilyn! Is’ta true you hava many
times tried to suicide?
Another Audacious Party, gleaming with sweat, with a boiled
looking face, thrusts an envelope at the frightened Blonde
Actress. It’s addressed to MARILYN MONROE in red ink and
decorated with valentine hearts.
Then she’s thrust into the limousine and the rear door is
shut. Her escorts speak sharply to the crowd.
STUDIO SECURITY GUARD
Give the girl a break, will you!
She’s suffering, can’t you see!
The limousine moves off, slowly, the crowd still clamoring
for attention and cameras still flashing.
174 INT. LIMOUSINE. DAY. 174
After a beat.
NORMA JEANE
Am I divorced now? Is it over?
ATTORNEY
Marilyn, you were divorced a week
ago. Remember? In Mexico City? We
flew down together.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, I guess. It’s all over then?
ATTORNEY
All over, dear. For the time being.
They ride in silence, then:
NORMA JEANE
Excuse me? I’m divorced, now?
Uncomfortable beat. She sees by their faces that she must
have asked this question already.
She sits clutching the valentine envelope in her fingers.91.
NORMA JEANE
I’m so lonely. I don’t understand
why I’m so lonely when I’ve loved
so many people. But I’ve lost them
all. Men say they love me but who’s
it they love? ‘Marilyn.’
A man clears his throat.
STUDIO P.R. MAN.
Your interview is over now,
Marilyn. Why don’t you relax.
NORMA JEANE
Why love goes wrong, it’s a
mystery. I didn’t invent that
mystery, did I? Why am I to blame?
STUDIO P.R. MAN.
The interview is over Marilyn.
NORMA JEANE
Don’t stare at me, please! I’m not
a freak. I don’t care to be
memorized for anecdotal purposes.
She opens the valentine envelope. The P.R. Man sees her
stricken face and quickly takes it from her.
STUDIO P.R. MAN.
Oh, Miss Monroe. Sorry.
It’s a square of toilet paper upon which someone has block
printed in what appears to be actual excrement:
WHORE
CUT TO:
Super: Palm Springs 1962
175 EXT. PARTY PALM SPRINGS HOUSE. NIGHT. 175
She drifts uncertainly around the terrace like a sleepwalker,
vaguely smiling, that look about her of such vulnerability,
such not-thereness, that others keep their distance too.
CUT TO:92.
The boyishly handsome leader of the free world - THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES - staring.
THE PRESIDENT
That blonde. That’s Marilyn Monroe!
THE PRESIDENT’S PIMP
Luscious, eh? But a little crazy.
THE PRESIDENT
Remind me. Have I dated her yet?
Uneasily, in a lowered voice, conscious of the many admiring
eyes on them:
THE PRESIDENT’S PIMP
Chief, She’s a tramp. She’s been a
tramp from the get-go. She’s sucked
every cock in town, and more from
out of town. She used to live with
two faggot junkies out in
Hollywood. She’s had a dozen
abortions, she’s addicted to Coke, *
Benzedrine, had her stomach pumped *
out a dozen times at Cedars alone. *
She was carried into Bellevue stark *
naked and raving, streaming blood *
from both arms. This was in *
Winchell’s column. *
THE PRESIDENT
(impressed)
You know her, eh?
THE PRESIDENT’S PIMP
She’s a poor risk for a
relationship, Chief.
THE PRESIDENT
Who’s talking about a relationship?
I’m talking about a date in the
cabana there. If there’s time, two.
He looks at the Blonde Actress; swaying at the edge of the
shimmering aqua pool, eyes shut, mouthing the words to
Sinatra’s ‘All the Way’. Platinum hair glowing like
phosphorescence. That red-lipsticked mouth a perfect sucking
O.
THE PRESIDENT
Make the arrangements. Pronto.93.
176 INT. THE CABANA. POST COITAL. 176
They’re cuddled naked together on tossed down beach towels
and terry-cloth robes: Her Prince frames her naked face in
his hands. Speaks to her sincerely, from his heart:
THE PRESIDENT
There’s something in you none of
them has, Marilyn. No woman I know.
You’ve alive to be touched. To be
breathed on like a flame. Alive to
be hurt even! No woman I know is
like you, Marilyn.
NORMA JEANE
You can call me Norma Jeane.
THE PRESIDENT
You’ll always be Marilyn to me.
Wanted to meet Marilyn for a long
time now.
The room seems to brighten!
NORMA JEANE
Oh, I’m so happy! Where only an
hour ago I’d been so sad! Wishing I
hadn’t been talked into coming to
this party. But now I’m so happy!
NORMA JEANE (V.O.)
Suddenly I’m ‘The Girl Upstairs’!
No longer a divorcee! No longer a *
mother who killed her baby...
FLASHBACK TO:
He’s hurting her, gripping her hips so hard:
THE PRESIDENT
Yes, yes, like that, yes.
Biting her breasts, biting the nipples.
THE PRESIDENT
You dirty girl. Dirty cunt, I love
you, dirty cunt.94.
NORMA JEANE (V.O.)
...And already forgetting the
names, the ugly words, he called
me, and soon I’ll forget I forgot
anything, and by tomorrow morning,
I’ll remember only kisses:
CUT BACK TO:
The President dressing.
NORMA JEANE
Would you like my unlisted
telephone number Mr. President?
THE PRESIDENT
(laughs)
There are no unlisted telephone
numbers, Marilyn.
NORMA JEANE
Call me Norma Jeane, that’s what
people call me, who know me.
THE PRESIDENT
(zipping up his fly)
What I’m going to call you, baby,
is whenever I get the chance.
Pronto!
And with a final kiss, he’s gone.
177 INT. 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE - BRENTWOOD. DAY. 177
She’s watching the telephone. For once in her life she wants
it to ring!
178 INT. HER BEDROOM - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. NIGHT. 178
His image on the T.V. talking to her alone...
THE PRESIDENT (ON T.V.)
...Something in you none of them
has. No woman. Alive to be touched.
To be breathed on like a flame. No
woman I know is like you, Marilyn. *
NORMA JEANE
It’s like saying he loves me.
Except not in those words.95.
179 INT. 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE - BRENTWOOD. DAY. 179
The kitchen phone: RiingGG!!! *
The Living room phone: Riiinnngggg! *
The bedroom phone: RiinGG!!!!! *
She picks up, feeling giddy:
MAN’S VOICE (ON PHONE)
Miss Monroe?
NORMA JEANE
Yes?
MAN’S VOICE (ON PHONE)
Will you be home to take a call at
10. 25 PM, tonight.
She laughs, has to sit, she feels so weak.
NORMA JEANE
Will I be h-home? Hmmm! How’ll I
know for sure till 10.25 PM gets
here?
A bemused murmur on the other end.
180 INT. 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE - BRENTWOOD. 10.25 PM. 180
... RiinGG!!!!!
NORMA JEANE
H’lo?
THE PRESIDENT (ON PHONE)
H’lo? Marilyn? I’ve been thinking
about you.
NORMA JEANE
I’ve been thinking about you, too,
Mr P-for-Pronto!
He laughs.
THE PRESIDENT (ON PHONE)
Listen, I have to be in New York
for the weekend, how’d you like to
rendezvous at the Carlyle? We’ll *
have to be discrete... *96.
181 INT. FRONT DOOR 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE - BRENTWOOD. NIGHT.181
She opens the door to Secret Service agents whose expressions
shift to disgust like coagulation.
What? She’s wearing new clothes from Saks in understated
cream and heather tones, her hair’s been brightened, her
lipstick’s bright, but isn’t lipstick meant to be bright?
NORMA JEANE
You were expecting maybe Mother
Teresa?
182 EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. DAY. 182
Walking to the plane with little mincing steps.
NORMA JEANE (V.O.)
The most exciting and profound
adventure of my life as a woman.
A rendezvous. With him! Surely the
airliner will crash!
INSERT: AN AIRPLANE EXPLODING! A BALL OF FLAME!
183 INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN - AIRPLANE. DAY. 183
She shakes out some Miltown, some Amytal, some Codeine.
Considers.
STEWARDESS
Dom Perignon, Miss Monroe?
NORMA JEANE
Just a little. Oh, Just to help me
sleep.
She takes the glass, she downs the pills.
184 INT. TOILET - FIRST CLASS CABIN - AIRPLANE. LATER. 184
Now she’s vomiting into the miniature toilet.
185 INT. FIRST CLASS CABIN - AIRPLANE. DAY. 185
Now somebody is shaking her awake:
STEWARDESS
Miss Monroe? Miss Monroe?97.
186 INT - FIRST CLASS CABIN TO LAGUARDIA. DAY. 186
On shaky legs the first to disembark.
STEWARDESS
Miss Monroe? Let me assist you.
The Stewardess leads her along the tunnel ramp from the
plane. And there at...
187 THE GATE... 187
...Two unsmiling men wait in dark suits and fedoras. She
panics:
NORMA JEANE
(turning to the
Stewardess)
Am I under arrest? What will happen
to me?
She drops her overnight bag, her hands shaking. The Agents
look at her in disgust, averting their eyes from her fuchsia
mouth, her heaving breasts. All watch with alarm as she
lowers herself to the floor.
STEWARDESS
Miss Monroe? You dont want to lay
down here.
The disgusted agents take her arms and drag her up.
188 INT. LIMOUSINE. (MOVING) DAY. 188
She laughs nervously in the silence.
NORMA JEANE *
It isn’t sexual. Between the *
President and me. It has little to *
do with sex. It’s a meeting of our *
souls. *
NORMA JEANE (V.O.) *
(beat) *
Oh, did I say that out loud? *
Doughy-faced JIGGS grunts. DICK TRACY, in profile, gives no
sign of hearing. The DRIVER bears an uncanny resemblance to
the comic-strip character JUGHEAD. (Digital alteration) It’s
a little scary! Comic-strip people populating the world!98.
DICK TRACY
(handing her an envelope)
Your ticket, ma’am, for your return
to LA this evening.
NORMA JEANE
This e-evening but..?
DICK TRACY
The president’s plans have changed
ma’am, so your plans have changed.
There’s an emergency situation
calling him back to Washington this
afternoon. He can’t stay overnight
after all.
NORMA JEANE
(disappointed)
Oh, I see. *
(after a beat) *
I guess you can’t tell me what it *
is? The emergency? *
DICK TRACY *
Miss Monroe. Sorry. That’s *
classified. *
189 EXT. CARLYLE-HOTEL. VARIOUS. DAY. 189
The limousine passes the front of the Carlyle Hotel on Fifth
avenue, and turns into a narrow alleyway behind the massive
landmark building, pulling up before a rear entrance.
190 INT. LIMOUSINE. NARROW ALLEYWAY. DAY. 190
She is handed a cheap plastic raincoat with a hood.
DICK TRACY
Put this over your clothes ma’am.
She is furious, but complies. She removes from her handbag a
pair of very dark glasses and puts them on, hiding her face.
JIGGS hands her a tissue.
JIGGS
Please remove the red grease from
your mouth, ma’am.
NORMA JEANE
I will not. Let me out of this car.99.
JIGGS
Ma’am, you can put it on again
inside. As much as you wish.
She stares at them indignantly.
191 EXT. LIMOUSINE. NARROW ALLEYWAY. DAY. 191
Outside the car we witness the struggle within. Then the
Limousine doors unlock, and they climb out, and escort the
blonde actress the twenty feet to the rear entrance.
192 INT. KITCHEN - CARLYLE HOTEL. DAY. 192
She’s escorted almost violently through a ventilator blast of
rancid cooking odors and quickly ushered into a freight
elevator.
193 INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - CARLYLE HOTEL. DAY. 193
They creak upward to the sixteenth floor, the men’s faces
distorting, now literally animations: DICK TRACY, JIGGS,
leering cartoon characters.
194 INT. PRESIDENTIAL FLOOR - CARLYLE HOTEL. DAY. 194
The doors open, and she is urged out, in haste.
DICK TRACY
Miss Monroe, ma’am - Step along
please, ma’am.
NORMA JEANE
I can walk myself, thank you, I’m
not crippled.
Though she stumbles a little in her high heeled shoes. So
they lift her, and whisk her along, her feet no longer
touching the floor.
NORMA JEANE
Am I meat? To be delivered? Is that
what this is? Room service?
The door the Presidential suite is opened by another BUGS-
BUNNY-faced secret service agent.
BUGS BUNNY
Ma’am!100.
The scene begins to move in a swerving zig-zag course as if
the camera is being jostled. She is moved toward a bathroom.
BUGS BUNNY
Should you wish to freshen up, Miss
Monroe.
195 INT. BATHROOM. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. CONTINUOUS. 195
In the elegantly appointed gilt and marble cubicle, as she
sits on the toilet and washes herself between the legs, she
notices in the waste basket beside her: TISSUES BLOTTED WITH
PLUMB-COLORED LIPSTICK.
On her face: Oh, no. Not this.
She shakes out a Miltown tablet for her nerves and a
Benzedrine for courage.
BUGS BUNNY (PRE-LAP)
This way ma’am.
196 INT. CORRIDOR - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. SOON AFTER. 196
She follows Bugs Bunny along a corridor.
BUGS BUNNY
In here, ma’am.
Breathless, she finds herself entering a spacious but...
197 DIMLY LIT BEDROOM... 197
NORMA JEANE (V.O.)
The most exciting and profound
adventure of my life as a woman.
What romance! I step into
history...
...And there; upon the canopied four poster bed, among the
soiled linens, ashtrays, dirty plates, a depleted bottle of
burgundy, wineglasses marked with the same plumb-colored
lipstick; the naked President is sprawled with a telephone
resting on his chest as he speaks into the receiver. Seeing
the Blonde Actress make her entrance, the President beckons
her to him, even as he holds the receiver to his ear.
THE PRESIDENT
(to phone)
Uh-huh. Yup. Gotcha. OK. Shit.101.
He gestures for her to sit beside him on the bed, which she
does, and he begins absently stroking her; hair, breasts,
hips.
THE PRESIDENT
(whispers )
Am I glad to see you, Baby. This
has been a hell of a day.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, gosh, I’ve been told, darling.
How can I help?
The President takes her hand away from his unshaven jaw, and
encloses her fingers around his now-upright penis. (Off-
screen, of course) Gamely, the Blonde Actress begins to stoke
him, yet the President does not hang up the phone. His
handsome face turns ugly.
THE PRESIDENT
Goddamn Cocksucking motherfucker!
Payback for the Bay of Pigs, eh?
We’ll see!
He looks at her, irritated.
THE PRESIDENT
Baby. C’mon.
He tugs at her hair. Pulls her toward him, to kiss her
roughly, as he grips the phone receiver between his neck and
shoulder. Out of the receiver’s plastic interior a miniature
male voice drones. Rusk? McNamara?
THE PRESIDENT
(whispers)
Don’t be shy.
She knows what she’s expected to do, what the script demands
of her, but resists. She’s looking at a wine glass with a
plumb-colored lipstick stain.
THE PRESIDENT
(irritated)
Baby...?
He grips her by the nape of the neck and pushes her head to
his groin. We are tight on Norma Jeane’s eyes, confused and
frightened, as we hear her thoughts.
NORMA JEANE (V.O.)
Who brought me here? ...To this
place? ...Was it Marilyn? But why
does Marilyn do these things?
(MORE)102.
NORMA JEANE (V.O.) (cont'd)
What does Marilyn want? ...Or is it
a movie scene? Possibly it’s 1948
again and I’ve been dropped by the
studio... I’m playing the part of a
Famous Blonde Actress meeting the
Boyishly Handsome leader of the
free world, the President of the
United States, for a Romantic
Rendezvous... ‘The Girl Upstairs’
in harmless soft-porn film, just
once, Why not?
Any scene can be played. Whether
well or badly, it can be played.
And it wont last more than a few
minutes.
THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
Dirty Girl. Dirty cunt.
NORMA JEANE (V.O.)
Just don’t puke. Not here. Not in
this bed. Don’t cough. Don’t gag.
You have to swallow, you have to
swallow.
Her jaws ache, the nape of her neck where he grips her, so
hard. His hips buck.
On the television: Flying Saucers are destroying Washington.
THE PRESIDENT
Dirty Girl. Dirty cunt. Oh, baby.
You’re fan-tas-tic!!
And then it’s over. He lays there panting, a forearm flung
over his eyes. She anticipates that he will speak to her but
he does not.
Long uncomfortable beat.
She‘s desperate for lines, any lines.
NORMA JEANE
C-Castro? He’s a dictator? But,
Pronto, should the Cuban people be
punished? This embargo? Oh gosh
won’t that make them hate us all
the more?
There’s a seismic upheaval in the bed, he’s lunging and then
she’s falling...
198 FALLING DOWN A LONG ELEVATOR SHAFT... 198103.
199 OR IS HE?... 199
Pressing on her windpipe. A palm over her mouth. An elbow
against her neck. Darkness creeping in.
200 LATER... 200
Her eyes flutter, she’s too weak to protest, another man, a
stranger, mounted upon her vigorously, a man in a hurry, in a
white shirt, thrusting blindly.
NORMA JEANE
No! No please! This isn’t fair. I
love the President and no other.
NORMA JEANE (V.O.)
Possibly this is the President?
clean-shaven now?
The Man thrusts into her doggedly, like he’s kicking into
hard packed sand.
FADE TO BLACK.
201 LATER STILL... 201
They’re trying to revive her. Shaking her, her head lolling
on her shoulders. Bloodshot eyes rolled back into her skull.
A voice, cold with fury:
THE PRESIDENT (O.S.)
For Christ’s sake, get her out of
here.
DICK TRACY (PRE-LAP)
Miss Monroe. This way. Ma’am do you
need assistance.
202 INT. CORRIDOR - PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. NIGHT. 202
She’s being led from the suite by a side entrance, DICK TRACY
to her left, JIGGS to her right, both men gripping her by the
upper arm. Through a partly opened door she sees the
President! In a dark pinstripe suit laughing with a red
haired young woman in jodpurs. Norma Jeane stares at them,
her heart beating hard.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, excuse me?104.
She means to slip into the room to say goodbye, but Dick
Tracy and Jiggs yank her away with such violence that her
arms are loosened from their sockets. The President is
staring at her; his face is flushed with anger as he strides
to the door and shuts it in her face. She tries to struggle
with her captors. One shakes her and the other slaps her face
and suddenly her mouth is bleeding:
NORMA JEANE
Oh! My new dress.
She begins to cry. She is bleeding through her fingers.
JIGGS
You’re not hurt ma’am. That’s red
grease from your mouth.
203 INT. BATHROOM. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE. CONTINUOUS. 203
In the gilt and marble bathroom; blazing with light that
hurts her eyes, she sits and pees into the toilet, a scalding
flaming pee, that causes her to whimper out loud. A sharp rap
on the door.
JIGGS (O.S.)
Ma’am.
NORMA JEANE
No. no. I’m fine. Don’t come inside
please.
In the mirror is her Magic Friend: Sallow skinned and
exhausted, an eyelash hanging loose, a crust of puke lining
her lips.
SFX: The sound of an airliner touching down.
She wakes and sees herself with a monster’s mud face in the
mirror and screams! screams!
204 INT. HER BEDROOM - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 204
Whitey comes running in, his hand on his heart.
WHITEY
What’s wrong, Miss Monroe?
(He was just in the other room, while she was dozing in her
mud pack.) She laughs.105.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, gosh, I thought I was dead,
Whitey. Just for a second.
And they laugh together, who knows why. She reaches for the
open bottle of cherry brandy, and from this they each have
several swallows and laugh again, tears in their eyes.
205 INT. 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 205
She follows Whitey through the house; strewn with discarded
clothing, towels, paper plates, food containers, books and
newspapers, and unwanted scripts forwarded by her agent, like
debris on the beach in the aftermath of a storm.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, Whitey, Norma Jeane is so tired
of cleaning up after Marilyn.
At the front door, Whitey is overcome.
NORMA JEANE
Whitey? What’s wrong?
WHITEY
Miss Monroe, please. I’m not
crying.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, Whitey. You are too crying.
WHITEY
No, Miss Monroe I’m not.
She says gently, careful of Whitey’s feelings:
NORMA JEANE
Whitey? Promise me? After I’m...
(gone) ...will you make Marilyn up?
One final time?
WHITEY
Miss Monroe, I will.
They embrace. On Norma Jeane as he departs.
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
I see your beautiful face often & wonder
how you appear so untouched.106.
206 INT. - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 206
We move through the sad, debri-strewn house...
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
I heard of your most recent sorrow in a
time of sorrow of my own for my beloved
wife of many years has passed away. I am
awaiting a period of calm before
considering what direction my life must
now move in.
We discover Norma Jeane reading this letter by a little safe,
which contains all his treasured letters.
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
Dear Daughter, the thought has come to
me: It may be that your life has also
changed, that you might wish to live with
me.
NORMA JEANE
Yes. Oh yes. But why don’t you
declare yourself? Why are you
waiting?
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
(as the camera moves on)
My house is spacious I assure you,
realtors call it a mansion.
I hope to contact you soon, dear Norma.
Forgive an aging man his recalcitrance to
awaken old hurts.
Your tearful Father
207 INT. HER BEDROOM - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 207
She’s looking at her swollen breasts in the mirror. Placing a
hand on her belly.
CUT TO:107.
208 BABY... 208
...misshapen in the womb, no larger than a seahorse, floating
in liquid darkness.
209 INT. HER BEDROOM - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. NIGHT. 209
She wakes, heart knocking in terror, the sound of someone
bumping in the house.
Through the door:
Can she see the shadow of one of them? Dick Tracy? Jiggs?
Maybe it’s just the drugs?
210 INT. LIVING ROOM - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 210
Sitting there like a zombie. When the phone rings suddenly,
startling her! She looks at it in terror. Approaches it, and
lifts the receiver:
NORMA JEANE
Hi there? H’lo? Who’s it?
She’s hears the clicking-crackling on the line, is it being
tapped?
Through the window:
A van parked unobtrusively in a neighbor’s driveway.
Monitoring equipment?
211 INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - BRENTWOOD. DAY. 211
Handing her a prescription:
BRENTWOOD DOCTOR
Here’s a little something to help
you sleep
Then, apropos of nothing:
BRENTWOOD DOCTOR
Of course, we’ll have to do a
pelvic examination, Miss Monroe,
and, of course, a pregnancy test.
NORMA JEANE
(scared)
Oh! But I don’t have time today.108.
212 INT. HER BEDROOM - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. NIGHT. 212
The smashing of glass, the sound of someone entering the
house. She lays in bed, rigid and paralysed with animal fear,
hiding under the covers.
NORMA JEANE
(frantic)
The circle of light is yours you
enclose yourself in the circle you
carry it with you...
Then, suddenly, the sheets are pulled back and a wadded cloth
soaked in chloroform is being pressed over her nose and mouth
and she cannot draw breath to scream and... *
213 ...HOUSE... 213
...to a...
214 ...WAITING VEHICLE... 214
...And the bright lights of an...
215 ...OPERATING THEATRE 215
...and (is she going mad like Gladys?) a surgeon above her,
in the BLINDING LIGHT, with surgical instruments and the
RUBBER HANDS poking at her with pokey fingers...(this
happened before, right? Has she traveled backwards in time?)
...and she wakes exhausted and panting. In her... *
216 ...BEDROOM AT 12305 FIFTH HELENA DRIVE... DAY. 216
NORMA JEANE
Oh Christ, what an ugly dream.
And then she’s getting to her feet, breathing hard, not
seeing the mattress, now revealed under the covers, soaked
through with dark brackish blood.
Hanging onto the doorframe, fighting waves of nausea in
her...109.
217 BATHROOM AT 12305 FIFTH HELENA DRIVE... DAY. 217
...Staring at her haggard face in the mirror, she never left
home?
NORMA JEANE
What a crazy dream!
There, written on the mirror in lipstick are the words:
Help! Help
EDDY G (PRE-LAP)
Norma? ...It’s Eddy. G.
....................Cass is dead.
Choked on his puke and strangled.
Classic alky death, huh? I found
him when I came over this morning.
...Are you there?
218 INT. HER BEDROOM - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. NIGHT. 218
Hunched forward, a fist jammed in her mouth.
EDDY G (ON PHONE)
Cass left a memento for you, Norma.
Most of his things he left to me -
see, I was his good buddy, never
let him down, so he left most of
his things to me - but this
memento, ‘This is for Norma
someday’ he’d say. It meant a lot
to him. ’Norma always had my
heart.’ He’d say.
NORMA JEANE
(whispers)
No.
EDDY G (ON PHONE)
No what?
NORMA JEANE
I d-don’t want it, Eddy.
EDDY G (ON PHONE)
How do you know you don’t want it,
Norma? You don’t know what it is?
She has no reply.110.
EDDY G (ON PHONE)
Right, baby. I’ll send it. Look for
special delivery.
219 INT. FRONT DOOR - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 219
A Hispanic boy in a Cal Tech T shirt.
MESSENGER
Ma’am? Package.
She takes from his hand the lightweight package, with an
envelope, wrapped in candy-cane striped tinsel with a
dimestore satin bow.
NORMA JEANE
(to the Messenger)
Wait? Just a m-minute.
220 INT. LIVING ROOM - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 220
Searching for her purse...
NORMA JEANE
Oh, where’s my wallet, not in my
purse? Oh where did I put it?
She begins to perspire, searching for the wallet amid a
confusion of items in the shadowy living room...
221 INT. HER BEDROOM - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 221
...and in the bedroom...
222 INT. KITCHEN - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 222
...at last finding it in the kitchen, fumbling through it to
locate a bill, and hurrying back to the front door, but...
223 INT. FRONT DOOR - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 223
...The Messenger has vanished. In the palm of her hand, a
twenty-dollar bill.
NORMA JEANE
Oh?111.
224 INT. KITCHEN - 12305 5TH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 224
She pulls away the tinsel with trembling fingers:
It is the Little Stuffed Tiger. The one Eddy G had picked up
for Baby.
NORMA JEANE
Oh, my God.
(beat)
But you wanted baby dead too. You
know you did.
She opens the card Cass has included with the toy. It has the
distinct handwriting...
To MM in her life, Your Tearful Father.
Off her scream:
CUT TO:
225 INT. 12305 FIFTH HELENA DRIVE. DAY. 225
She’s burning the letters in her fireplace, the only use to
which it will ever be put.
226 INT. BATHROOM AT 12305 FIFTH HELENA DRIVE. NIGHT. 226
She’s opening the bottle of Nembutal, seventy five-tablets,
and taking them all, slowly, methodically...
227 INT. HER BEDROOM 12305 FIFTH HELENA DRIVE. NIGHT. 227
...and a strobing light filling the bedroom, a beautiful
ecstatic light...
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.)
Keep your concentration Norma Jeane
don’t be distracted the circle of
light is yours you enclose
yourself in this circle you carry
it with you wherever you go
...And coming out of the light, a figure coming clearer, a
handsome, smiling man, a man with a pencil thin moustache and
dark, soulful eyes. A man who seems to Norma Jeane about to
speak. A man who seems about to take her in his arms. You see
that man, Norma Jeane. That man is your father.
(MORE)112.
ELDERLY MAN’S VOICE (V.O.) (cont'd)
Every baby needs a Da-da-daddy
To keep her worry free .
Every baby needs a da-da-daddy
But where’s the one for me?
FADE OUT.
