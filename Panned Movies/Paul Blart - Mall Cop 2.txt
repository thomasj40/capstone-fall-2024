The road of life is always under
construction...
FADE IN:

BLART (V.O.)
... thejourney is hard, but once
you reach the top, the view is
amazing.
Amy and Blart getting married.*
BLART (V.O.)
And that view is even more
beautiful when you have someone to

INT. BLART’S MOM’S FRONT DOORWAY - DAY22Blart opens the door and is handed
a LETTER by a STERN MAN.
BLART (V.O.)
...forsix days.
INT. BLART’S MOM’S HOUSE - LATER33Blart sits in his Mom’s living room,
holding the letter. She
rubs his back as he CRIES HYSTERICALLY.
BLART (V.O.)
My beautiful wife of almost a week
let me know by letter that she had,
what I like to call “some regrets.”
Her doctor called it,
“uncontrollable vomiting.” Her
lawyer... “dissolution of
marriage.”
He looks up at his Mom, cries a little more... and then RUNS
out of the room.
BLART (V.O.)
That’s okay, I needed a little time
to myself. Like the song says:
I’ve been to paradise, but I’ve
never been to me.

smile, and very politely say, “you
hit like a small boy.” And...
(then)
At least I still had the one thing
that never seemed to let me down...
security.
INT. WEST ORANGE PAVILLIONMALL - DAY3A3AWe see Blart at the mall, throwing
himself into his work. He
rides through the mall, UP-NODDING to passing customers.
BLART (V.O.)
I spent the next two years losing
myself in the sweet escape of
keeping the West Orange Pavilion
Mall safe.
Blart spies a SMALL CHILD who appears lost. He rolls up to
him on the segway and takes his hand, leading him to find his
mom.
Seeing the MOM, Blart reunites her with the boy. The mom is
overjoyed.
MOMThank you!
(then to boy)
Now give the fake cop a hug Andy.
Blart is flattered and leans in for the hug. Andy is having
none of it. Blart goes in again -- nothing.
MOM (CONT’D)
(getting agitated)
Andy... hug him.
BLARTUh... he doesn’t want a hug that’s
okay.
Blart is now frozen in the hug lean position.
MOM(still to son)
You are embarrassing me.
Blart back away and leans in one more time, but the kid just
BELTS HIM and runs away. The mom runs after him.
Blart awkwardly gets on his segway and rides away.

into the street...
BLART’S MOMOh, here’s the paper.
...and is DRILLED by an old-fashioned MILK TRUCK.
BLART (V.O.)
That is until she got drilled by a
milk truck. Didn’t know they even
had those anymore.
INT. BLART’S MOM’S HOUSE - DAY55Blart once again sits in his mom’s living
room looking at a
FRAMED PHOTO of his mom... CRYING, uncontrollably. Maya, who
is now 19 years old, rubs his back. He once again gets up and
RUNS out of the room.
BLART (V.O.)
Besides my Maya, it didn’t seem
like I had very much to look
forward to.
// INT. BLART’S MOM’S HOUSE - MORNINGBlart once again sits in his mom’s

Dicerosbicornis... a black rhino.
Maya, who is now 19 years old, rubs his back. He once again
gets up and RUNS out of the room.
INT. WEST ORANGE PAVILLIONMALL - DAY66We see a melancholy Blart as he rides
through the mall.
BLART (V.O.)

Blart pulls something from his pocket. It’s a MECHANICAL
VIBRATING FORK. He begins to pick at the conch fritters.
MAYAWhat is that?
BLARTMy vibrating fork. It forces me

Officer Manerohere, who, in my

As Blart enters in his mask and angel wings, he finds himself

On the run, Carlos looks back and fires his silenced pistol
at Blart, but the BULLETS RICOCHET off the carbon fiber of
the bad ass Gyro-Vehicle.
Carlos continues to fire as Blart actually speeds up! When
he is close enough, Blart BAILS OFF THE BACK of the bad ass

Carlos takes the impact, which slams him back. Knocking the

The marbles SPREAD OUT onto the floor, parting like the Red
Sea, having ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT. Undaunted, Carlos
continues his pursuit.
Changing gears, Blart SPRINTS FOR A LARGER CEMENT PLANTER.
As he approaches the PLANTER, Blart executes his SIGNATURE

the planter, gun drawn.
Carlos comes around the planter and aims his gun at BlartBut Blart is

Blart then begins to scroll through Carlos’ CELL PHONE.
Carlos stirs. But, before he can get up, Blart zaps him,
